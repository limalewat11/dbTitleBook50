Since he left his simple life in the small town of Pico Mundo, California, his journey has taken him to places strange and wonderful, mysterious and terrifying. Across the land, in the company of mortals and spirits alike, he has known kindness and cruelty, felt love and loss, saved lives and taken them&#x2014;as he&#x2019;s borne witness to humanity&#x2019;s greatest good and darkest evil.&nbsp;Again and again, he has gone where he must and done what he had to do&#x2014;for better or worse&#x2014;with his courage and devotion sorely tested, and his soul forever changed. Every triumph has been hard won. Each sacrifice has taken its toll.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, whatever destiny drives him has finally steered his steps home, where those he cares for most surround him, the memory of his tragically lost true love haunts him, and one last challenge&#x2014;vast and dreadful&#x2014;awaits him. For Odd Thomas, born to serve a purpose far greater than himself, the wandering is done. Only the reckoning remains.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Saint Odd</i></b> <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Equal parts supernatural thriller, cultural satire, character study, bildungsroman, offbeat love story, road trip, spiritual meditation, and apocalyptic adventure, the Odd Thomas books . . . are more than irresistible page-turners.

This would not be the first time in my strange life that safety proved to be an illusion.<br><br> I have a tendency to hope always for the best, even when I&#x2019;m being strangled with a little girl&#x2019;s jump rope knotted around my neck by an angry, three-�hundred-�pound Samoan wrestler. In fact, I got out of that difficult situation alive, primarily by getting hold of his beloved porkpie hat, which he considered the source of his good luck. When I spun the hat like a Frisbee and he let go of the jump rope to try to snatch his chapeau from the air, I was able to pick up a croquet mallet and surprise him with a blow to the genitals, which was especially effective because he was wearing only a thong. Always hoping for the best has generally served me well.<br><br> Anyway, under a full moon, the desert was as eerie as a landscape on an alien planet. The great black serpent of highway undulated over a series of low rises and gentle downslopes, through sand flats that glowed faintly, as if radioactive, past sudden thrusting formations of rock threaded through in places with quartzite or something else that caught the Big Dog motorcycle&#x2019;s headlights and flared like veins of fire.<br><br> In spite of the big moon and the bike&#x2019;s three blazing eyes, the Mojave gathered darkness across its breadth. Half-�revealed, gnarled shapes of mesquite and scatterings of other spiky plants bristled and seemed to leap forward as I flew past them, as if they were quick and hostile animals.<br><br> With its wide-�swept fairing and saddlebags, the Big Dog Bulldog Bagger looked like it was made for suburban marrieds, but its fuel-injected, 111-�cubic-�inch V-�twin motor offered all the speed anyone could want. When I had been on the interstate, before I had switched to this less-�traveled state highway, a quick twist of the throttle shot me past whatever car or big rig was dawdling in front of me. Now I cruised at seventy, comfortable in the low deep-�pocket seat, the rubber-�mounted motor keeping the vibration to a minimum.<br><br> Although I wore goggles and a Head Trip carbon-�fiber helmet that left my ears exposed, the shrieking wind and the Big Dog&#x2019;s throaty exhaust roar masked the sound of the Cadillac Escalade that, running dark, came up behind me and announced itself with a blast of the horn. The driver switched on the headlights, which flashed in my mirrors, so that I had to glance over my shoulder to see that he was no more than fifty feet behind me. The SUV was a frightening behemoth at that distance, at that speed.<br><br> Repeated blasts of the horn suggested the driver might be drunk or high on drugs, and either gripped by road rage or in the mood for a sick little game of chicken. When he tooted shave-�and-�a-�haircut-two-�bits, he held the last note too long, and I assured myself that anyone who indulged in such a clich� and then even lacked the timing to pull it off could not be a dangerous adversary.<br><br> Earlier, I had learned that the Big Dog&#x2019;s sweet spot was north of eighty miles an hour and that it was fully rideable at a hundred. I twisted the throttle, and the bike gobbled asphalt, leaving the Caddy behind. For the moment.<br><br> This wasn&#x2019;t the height of bug season in the Mojave, so I didn&#x2019;t have to eat any moths or hard-�shelled beetles when I muttered unpleasantries. At that speed, however, because I sat tall and tense with my head above the low windshield, the warm night air chapped my lips and stung my cheeks as I bulleted into it.<br><br> Any responsible dermatologist would have chastised me for speeding barefaced through this arid wasteland. For many reasons, however, there was little chance that I would live to celebrate my twenty-�third birthday, so looking prematurely aged two decades hence didn&#x2019;t worry me.<br><br> This time I heard the Escalade coming, shrieking like some malevolent machine out of a Transformers movie, running dark once more. Sooner than I hoped, the driver switched on the headlights, which flared in my mirrors and washed the pavement around me.<br><br> Closer than fifty feet.<br><br> The SUV was obviously souped. This wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary mama-takes-�baby-�to-�the-�playground Caddy. The engine sounded as if it had come out of General Motors by way of Boeing. If he intended to run me down and paste me to the Caddy&#x2019;s grille&#x2014;�and evidently he did&#x2014;�I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to outrace whatever customized engine made him king of the road.<br><br> Having tricked up his vehicle with alternate, multi-�tonal horns programmed with pieces of familiar tunes, he now taunted me with the high-�volume song-�title notes of Sonny and Cher&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Beat Goes On.&#x201d;<br><br> The Big Dog boasted a six-�speed transmission. The extra gear and the right-�side drive pulley allowed better balance and greater control than would the average touring bike. The fat 250-�millimeter rear tire gave me a sense of stability and the thirty-�four-�degree neck rake inspired the confidence to stunt a little even though I was approaching triple-digit speeds.<br><br> Now he serenaded me with the first seven notes of the Kingsmen&#x2019;s &#x201c;Louie Louie.&#x201d; And then again.<br><br> My one advantage might be maneuverability. I slid lower in the seat, so that the arc of the windshield sent the wind over my helmet, and I made more aggressive use of the three-�lane highway, executing wide serpentine movements from shoulder to shoulder. I was low to the ground, and the Escalade had a much higher center of gravity than the Big Dog; if the driver tried to stay on my tail, he might roll the SUV.<br><br> Supposing he was smart, he should realize that by not mimicking me, by continuing arrow-�straight, he could rapidly gain ground as I serpentined. And with easy calculation, he could intersect me as I swooped from side to side of the road.<br><br> The third blast of &#x201c;Louie Louie&#x201d; assured me that either he wasn&#x2019;t smart or he was so wasted that he might follow me into a pit of fire before he realized what he had done. Yet another programmed horn blared several notes, but I didn&#x2019;t recognize the tune, though into my mind came the image of that all-�but-�forgotten rocker Boy George.<br><br> When brakes caterwauled, I glanced back to see the Escalade listing, its tires smoking, as the driver pulled the wheel hard to the right to avoid going off the north side of the pavement. Carving one S after another down the straightaway, I cornered out of the current curve, grateful for the Big Dog&#x2019;s justly praised Balance Drive, and swooped into the next. With another squeal, the Caddy&#x2019;s tires laid a skin of hot rubber on the blacktop as the driver pulled hard to the left. The vehicle nearly skidded off the south shoulder of the roadway, listing again but, as previously, righting itself well before it tipped over.<br><br> Resorting to his basic horn, the driver made no attempt at a tune this time, but let out blast after blast as if he thought he could sweep me off the bike with sound waves.<br><br> Recounting this, I might convey the impression that I remained calm and collected throughout the pursuit, but in fact I feared that, at any moment, I would regret not having worn an adult diaper.<br><br> In spite of whatever drugs or beverages had pushed the SUV driver&#x2019;s crazy button and filled him with murderous rage, he retained just enough reason to realize that if he continued to follow my lead, he would roll the SUV. Arrowing down the center of the three lanes, he regained the ground that he&#x2019;d lost, intending to intersect my bike between connecting curves of my flatland slalom.<br><br> The Big Dog Bulldog Bagger wasn&#x2019;t meant to be a dirt bike. The diet that made it happy consisted of concrete and blacktop, and it wanted to be admired for its sleek aerodynamic lines and custom paint job and abundant chrome, not for its ruggedness and ability to slam through wild landscapes with aplomb.<br><br> Nevertheless, I went off-�road. They say that necessity is the mother of invention, but it is also the grandmother of desperation. The highway was raised about two feet above the land through which it passed, and I left the shoulder at such speed that the bike was airborne for a moment before returning to the earth with a jolt that briefly lifted my butt off the seat and made my feet dance on the floorboards.<br><br> Hereabouts, the desert wasn&#x2019;t a softscape of sand dunes and dead lakes of powdery silt, which was a good thing, because crossing ground like that, the Big Dog would have wallowed to a halt within a hundred yards. The land was mostly hard-�packed by thousands of years of fierce sun and scouring winds, the igneous rocks rich with feldspar, treeless but in some places hospitable to purple sage and mesquite and scraggly plants less easily identified.<br><br> Jacked up on oversize tires, more suited to going overland than was my bike, the four-�wheel-�drive Escalade came off the highway in my wake. I intended to find a break in the land or an overhanging escarpment deep enough to conceal me, or a sudden spine of rock, anything I could use to get out of sight of my lunatic pursuer. After that, I would switch off my headlights, slow down significantly, travel by moonlight, and try as quickly as possible to put one turn in the land after another between me and him. Eventually I might find a place in which to shelter, shut off the bike, listen, and wait.</p><h2>Transformed Into His Likeness: A Handbook for Putting Off Sin and Putting on Righteousness</h2><p>Many Christians pray, Lord, change me. Here is biblical help for those who want to change. Transformed Into His Likeness is a valuable resource for individual Christians seeking help in personal struggles, or for pastors and counselors and those they counsel. The workbook contains over 100 common problems facing Christians today along with biblical solutions for each. The strength of this resource is that it is a complete package. It explains the biblical process of change, helps identify where personal change is needed, provides pertinent Scripture references for problem areas, and offers a practical worksheet to walk you through the change process and help you implement biblical change into your life.</p><p></p><h2>The Method of Our Mission: United Methodist Polity &amp; Organization</h2><p><p>Theology shapes who we are and how we organize to transform the world. Especially written for required United Methodist classes, this accessible book uses a Wesleyan theological frame&#x2014;connection&#x2014;to help readers understand United Methodism&#x2019;s polity and organization as the interrelationship of our beliefs, mission, and practice. The book is organized into four parts&#x2014;United Methodist beliefs, mission, practice, and organization. Polity and organization are primary embodiments of The United Methodist Church. Functional in nature, these aspects of the denomination facilitate our mission to make disciples for the transformation of the world. This book connects denominational governance and organization to our beliefs as well as our mission. A clear understanding of our identity&#x2014;as Methodists with Wesleyan roots in connection&#x2014;and our purpose&#x2014;to make disciples for the transformation of the world&#x2014;can help students of United Methodism navigate this treacherous landscape as present and future leaders. Warner also addresses the estrangement between theology and institutional structures and practice by framing governance practices and organizational structure within a Wesleyan theology of connection. This approach will assist current and future denominational leaders in understanding their practices of administration and participation in polity as a theological endeavor and key component of their ministries.</p> <p>This textbook has been updated with changes from the 2016 General Conference.</p> <br></p><p>Laceye Warner is Executive Vice Dean, Associate Professor of the Practice of Evangelism and Methodist Studies, and Royce and Jane Reynolds Teaching Fellow at Duke Divinity School, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.</p><h2>The Company We Keep: In Search of Biblical Friendship</h2><p><p>Friendship: it&#x2019;s one of the simplest of human relationships in comparison to marriage or family relationships, yet it&#x2019;s one of the least understood and practiced. For all of our progress in making connections through Facebook, Twitter, and other social media, people are consistently experiencing loneliness and growing disenchanted with the whole notion of friendship.</p> <p>Could it be that our understanding of friendship has been more informed by pop culture and social media, and less informed by the vision of friendship offered in Scripture? Is it possible that friendship exists for a greater purpose than merely our enjoyment and comfort? Does real friendship involve more than just hanging out on a weekend, participating in a book club, or hitting the golf course together? These questions and more are answered in this book.</p> <p>Broader and deeper than simple fellowship, biblical friendship is first and foremost about a relationship with Jesus Christ. As you are brought into friendship and relationship with the Father, Jesus Christ calls you a friend! It is out of this friendship that our human friendships find their beginning and their purpose.</p> <p>Aelred, a Cistercian monk who wrote a profound treatise on friendship, said, &#x201c;And so in friendship are joined honor and charm, truth and joy, sweetness and good-will, affection and action. And all these take their beginning from Christ, advance through Christ, and are perfected in Christ.&#x201d; This is the core of biblical friendship, and what sets it apart from what the world is offering: it all flows from Jesus Christ. Friendship finds its origin, purpose, and power in Jesus. Our human friendships then must be shaped by this life-changing truth.</p> <p>Biblical friendship is deep, honest, pure, transparent, and liberating. It is also attainable. Dig into this book, and learn how your friendships can embody this amazing and wonderful reality.</p></p><p>Jonathan Holmes serves at Parkside Church in Cleveland, Ohio as the Pastor of Counseling.

Please visit our website, www.storycorps.net, to learn about the locations of our StoryBooths across the country. We also have two permanent facilities open year-round in Manhattan. Come visit New York City, make an appointment and record your loved one&#x2019;s voice for history. If you want to record an interview but are not able to visit one of our StoryBooths, we encourage you to do-it-yourself. Conduct your own interview and ask the questions you&#x2019;ve always wanted to ask. You may well be surprised by the power of the experience.Here&#x2019;s how:</p><p><b><i>1. Pick a Storyteller</i></b></p><p>Start the process by figuring out whom you want to interview. A grandparent? An old friend? Your mom? The person you invite might be hesitant. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have much to talk about,&#x201d; he&#x2019;ll say, or, &#x201c;You already know everything about my life.&#x201d; Remind your friend, your mother&#x2014;whoever it is&#x2014;how important you think their story is and how valuable it will be to future generations. Let that person know you would be honored to record his story.</p><p><b><i>2. Create a Question List</i></b></p><p>No matter how well you know your storyteller, a little preparation will improve the quality of your interview enormously. What would you like to learn from that person? We&#x2019;ve designed a question generator to make preparing questions a little easier. You can find it at www.storycorps.net.</p><p>Here are some questions that have yielded great responses:</p><p>� What have you learned in life?<br>� What does your future hold?<br>� What are you most proud of?<br>� Do you have any regrets?<br>� What was the happiest moment of your life? The saddest?<br>� Is there something about yourself that you think no one knows?<br>� How would you like to be remembered?</p><p>We&#x2019;ve also found that at the end of a session it can be powerful to turn the tables and tell the person you&#x2019;re interviewing what they mean to you.</p><p><b><i>3. Purchase or Borrow Recording Equipment(and Get Comfortable with It) </i></b></p><p>It is not difficult to make a terrific and clear recording of someone&#x2019;s voice. We strongly suggest that you create a recording with the best sound quality possible&#x2014;it&#x2019;s much more enjoyable and easy to listen to and will be appreciated by future generations. You will need three pieces of equipment: a recording device, a microphone and headphones. (You can learn more about equipment options at our website.) The recording equipment can be as simple as a micro cassette recorder or basic digital voice recorder, a pair of headphones and an inexpensive microphone (handheld, not clip-on). You can find both basic and more sophisticated recording equipment at your local electronics store. (StoryCorps also has a small equipment loan program called StoryKits, which you can also learn about at our website.)</p><p>Whatever equipment you choose, we strongly suggest that you practice using your equipment before you sit down for your interview.</p><p>A few things to remember:</p><p>� It&#x2019;s best to always wear headphones when recording. Your headphones are your &#x201c;ears&#x201d; for the interview; they tell you exactly what you&#x2019;ll hear on your finished recording. Use them to adjust the microphone position so the sound is as clear as possible.<br>� Hold the microphone close, about one spread-out hand&#x2019;s length from your storyteller&#x2019;s mouth. Always hold the microphone in your hand, moving it between you and your storyteller.<br>� Be careful of microphone noise. The low rumbling sound you hear when you move the microphone in your hands is known as &#x201c;mic-handling noise.&#x201d; You can avoid it by using a light touch and not shifting around too much. If you need to move the microphone, make sure to wait until your storyteller has finished speaking.</p><p>You may want to get together a group of friends and purchase recording equipment together. Someone from the group can act as the &#x201c;engineer&#x201d; during your interview and operate the equipment so you can focus on asking the questions. You can also share and talk about the stories you&#x2019;ve recorded with the group.</p><p><i><b>4. Choose an Interview Location</b></i></p><p><i><b>Pick the quietest place possible. </b></i> A carpeted living room or bedroom is often best. Avoid large empty rooms and kitchens, which are filled with reflective surfaces and appliance noise. We try to make the inside of each StoryCorps booth something of a sacred space, as peaceful and serene as possible. You may want to do the same: turn the lights low. Do whatever you can to make you and your subject as comfortable as possible.</p><p><i><b>Prevent noisy distractions. </b></i> Close the door; unplug the phone; turn off your cell phone. Turn off anything that is making noise: buzzing fluorescent lights, air conditioners, fans. Listen for noise during the interview as well. If your storyteller fiddles with her necklace, for example, feel free to let her know it&#x2019;s making noise. Never record interviews with a radio or television on in the background.</p><p><i><b>5. Set Up and Test the Equipment</b></i></p><p>Set up your equipment as early as possible and make sure you&#x2019;re comfortable with it. This way you&#x2019;ll be able to focus on the person you are interviewing and not the equipment. Before you begin your interview, record your storyteller answering a few warm-up questions such as &#x201c;Can you describe what this room looks like?&#x201d; or, &#x201c;Tell me what you had for breakfast.&#x201d; Stop, rewind and listen to the recording you just made to make sure everything is working. Remember to press RECORD again when you start the interview for real.</p><p><b><i>6. Begin the Conversation</i></b></p><p>Start your interview by stating your name, your age, the date and the location of the interview. For example, &#x201c;My name is Annie Smith. I&#x2019;m forty-one years old. The date is November 23, 2008, and I&#x2019;m sitting with my grandfather Mark Smith in his living room in Hannibal, Missouri.&#x201d; Now ask your storyteller to state the same information. Use your question list. Remember, the questions you write in advance are just suggestions. Trust your instincts. If something interests you or merits further exploration, ask more questions. Sometimes your storyteller will need &#x201c;permission&#x201d; to talk about a certain topic. Granting that permission might be as easy as saying, &#x201c;Tell me more.&#x201d; Don&#x2019;t let the question list constrain you. Feel free to ask questions in whatever order feels right. Take breaks if your storyteller needs them. Try not to say &#x201c;uh huh&#x201d; or interrupt when something interesting or important is being said. You can always use visual cues like nodding your head when you want to encourage the storyteller to keep going.</p><p><i><b>7. Get Great Stories</b></i></p><p>Here are some tips for helping the conversation flow:</p><p><i><b>Listen closely. Look at your storyteller&#x2019;s eyes, not the mic. Nod your head. Smile. Stay interested and engaged.</b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b>Be yourself</b></i>. You can laugh with the person you are interviewing or even cry with him. Real moments are the best moments.</b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b>Stick with the good stuff. When you hear something that moves you, feel free to talk about it more. If the current topic isn&#x2019;t what you wanted to put on tape, gently steer the conversation back on course.</b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b><i><b>Ask emotional questions. Questions such as &#x201c;How does this make you feel?&#x201d; often elicit interesting responses. Don&#x2019;t be afraid to ask.</b></i></b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b><i><b><i><b>Respect your subject</b></i>. If there&#x2019;s a topic she just doesn&#x2019;t want to talk about, respect her wishes and move on.</b></i></b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b><i><b>Take notes during the interview.</b></i> Write down any questions or stories you might want to return to later in your interview.</b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b><i><b>Be curious and honest and keep an open heart</b></i>. Great things will happen.</b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b><b><i>8. Wrap It Up</i></b></b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b>Before you turn off your recorder, do two things: ask the storyteller if there is anything else that she wants to talk about and thank her. Sharing a story can be difficult for some people. It&#x2019;s a privilege to have someone share her story with you. Express your gratitude. If you have a digital camera, take a picture of your interviewee against a plain background (or, if there&#x2019;s someone else around, have him take a picture of the two of you) in the style of the StoryCorps pictures you find in this book.</b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b>Make sure to label your recordings properly, make copies for relatives and friends and store them in a safe place so they&#x2019;ll be available for generations to come. (Unfortunately, StoryCorps does not have the capacity at the present time to enter these do-it-yourself interviews into our archives.)</b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b> <b><i>9. Share the Conversation</i></b></b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b>The conversation doesn&#x2019;t have to end once you turn off your recorder. In fact, it may just be the beginning. With the permission of your storyteller, you might share the interview by making copies of your recording to give to family and friends. You might also host a listening party. Invite others to your home to listen to your recording and share a conversation afterward. You could also listen to StoryCorps stories on our website.</b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b> <b><i>10. Plant a Seed</i></b></b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b>Storytelling can be a powerful tool, and your imagination is really the limit of what you can do with it. If you are a teacher, for instance, you might consider playing clips in your classroom as part of a history or writing unit. If you are part of a mentoring program, you could interview your mentor or mentee about their life experiences. Use the checklist and questions that follow to make sharing stories a part of your family, community or working life. <i>Congratulations! You have just joined the StoryCorps revolution!</i></b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b>DO-IT-YOURSELF CHECKLIST</b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b> <b><i>Things to Bring to the Interview</i></b></b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b>� Your question list<br>� Recording device<br>� Microphone<br>� Headphones<br>� Extra batteries and tapes<br>� Pen or pencil</b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b> <b><i>Before You Begin Your Interview</i></b></b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b><i>� Find the quietest place possible to record.<br>� Turn off radios and TVs and move away from noisy appliances like refrigerators and clocks.<br>� Make sure you and your storyteller are comfortable.<br>� Do a test recording, holding the microphone about one spread-out hand&#x2019;s distance from your storyteller&#x2019;s mouth. If anything sounds strange, stop and figure out what the problem is before starting the interview.</i></b></i></b></i></p><p><i><b><i><b><i> <b><i>During Your Interview</i></b></i></b></i></b></i></p><p><b><i><b><i>� Double-check that the recorder is actually recording (not on PAUSE).<br>� Start each tape with an ID: State your name, your age, the date and the location of the interview.

Lincoln Bowe, a Republican, has been missing for several days, setting off alarms on both sides of the political aisle. Finally, he is discovered in the remote Virginia woods, barb-wired to a tree, burned almost beyond recognition and missing his head. Democratic &#x2018;research assistant&#x2019; (read: fixer) Jacob Winter, ex-Army Intelligence, wounded in Afghanistan, is called in by the Democratic president to unravel an extremely messy situation and shield his office from any hint of scandal. As this runaway train picks up speed, innocents are murdered, and the guilty come to Jesus...<br>&nbsp;<br>"...Sandford is a master at creating believable, indelible characters like Winter...[He] is peerless when it comes to economical, taut plotting, most notably at building tension. <i>Dead Watch</i> is anything but politics as usual.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>San Antonio Express-News</i></p><p><b>John Sandford</b> is the pseudonym of Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist John Camp. He is the author of the Prey novels, the Kidd novels, the Virgil Flowers novels, <i>The Night Crew</i>, and <i>Dead Watch. </i>He lives in Minnesota.<p>&nbsp;</p>Former Virginia senator Lincoln Bowe is missing. His wife, Madison, believes his bitter political rival, Governor Arlo Goodman, is behind it. Critics scoff until she reveals a security tape showing two men loosely affiliated with Goodman threatening her in her home. Bowe's disappearance is a political time bomb. The presidential conventions are just over the horizon, and both parties fear the consequences if it detonates. The president, through his chief of staff, hires Jake Winter to investigate. Bowe's body is found soon after Winter initiates his investigation. Bowe was not a saint: his sexual dalliances, with both men and women, were numerous, and his obsession with destroying Goodman's political career may have driven him to contemplate political blackmail. Winter has plenty of suspects to choose from, and he knows the answer can be found somewhere in Washington's backrooms, where third-string campaign dirty tricksters change allegiances like other people change socks. Sandford, the best-selling author of the Prey series, displays an insider's knowledge of political infighting and couples it with his skill at creating memorable characters working through the maze of a diabolical plot. (Readers of a certain age will be reminded of Ross Thomas, grand master of the D.C. thriller from an earlier era.) The <i>real</i> Washington is awash with its own scandals and political time bombs, so expect readers to flock to this funhouse-mirror reflection of the real thing. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Visit her website at <b>www.readcarolyn.com.</b>Grade 7 Up-- In December 1860, a 34-year-old woman, Naduah--kidnapped 25 years earlier by Comanche Indians--was ``rescued'' by sol diers and returned to the white family who recognized her as their niece/sister/cousin Cynthia Ann Parker. Where the Broken Heart Still Beats tells her story. Naduah-Cynthia Ann was a real person, and Meyer skillfully interweaves fact and fiction in her book, alter nating third-person reminiscences of Naduah's life among the Comanche with journal entries by her 12-year-old cousin, Lucy (the most sen sitive and understanding of the Parkers). The struggle between the two ways of life is long and, in the end, unsuccessful. Both points of view, the Parkers' frustration at Cynthia Ann's reluctance to be ``civilized'' and Naduah's long ing for her Indian family and customs, are pre sented believably and without editorializing. The setting, Texas at the beginning of the Civil War, is smoothly integrated into the story; the captivating characters are well drawn. Meyer includes a map, a bibliography, and an author's note in which she discusses her research and ties loose ends together. Unaccountably miss ing is the information that Naduah-Cynthia Ann's son, Chief Quanah Parker, later located his mother's brother Silas and lived with the family for a time. This omission aside, Where the Broken Heart Still Beats is a fascinating look at the Comanche and their captives and will be enjoyed by teens who like historical fic tion and/or are interested in Native Americans and the West. --Ann W.

In this genius new collection of vegetarian recipes, author Anna Jones tackles this common problem, making nourishing vegetable-centered food realistic on any day of the week. <br><br>The chapters are broken down by time, with recipes that can be prepared in under 15, 20, 30, and 40 minutes, so no matter how busy you are, you can get dinner on the table, whether it be smoky pepper and white bean quesadilla, butternut squash and sweet leek hash, or chickpea pasta with simple tomato sauce. With evocative and encouraging writing, <i>A Modern Way to Cook </i>is a truly practical and inspiring recipe collection for anyone wanting to make meals with tons of flavor and little fuss.</p><p>ANNA JONES is a cook, food writer, and stylist. She worked for many years as part of Jamie Oliver&#x2019;s food team&#x2014;styling, writing, and working behind the scenes on books, TV shows, and food campaigns&#x2014;and went on to work with some of the UK&#x2019;s biggest food brands and best-known chefs. She is the author of <i>A Modern Way to Eat</i>, widely acclaimed as a book of the year. <i>A Modern Way to Cook </i>is her second book. She lives, writes, and cooks in Hackney, East London.From my experience working in homes, schools, and kitchens, with kids, adults, parents, and lunch ladies, I know for a fact that sitting down to a nourishing home-cooked meal every day can have a massive impact on our minds, bodies, and overall happiness. It shouldn&#x2019;t just be something we do for a Sunday lunch or once in a blue moon. Cooking a homemade meal is the single most important thing we can do for our well-being, because then we know exactly what is going into our bodies. It allows us to honor the people we are cooking it for and it means that we also get a chance to sit round a table, eat, drink, and really spend time with one another.<br><br>The more I cook simply&#x2014;easy pastas, quick hearty salads, and all-in-one gratins&#x2014;the more I realize that food doesn&#x2019;t need to be posh, complicated, or made from exotic ingredients to do us good. It&#x2019;s the quick-to-make, everyday, and weeknight meals that we eat on, say, Tuesdays and Wednesdays that make a real difference in our lives. These meals are the &#x201c;bread and butter&#x201d; of our eating week and the most important ones to focus on.&nbsp;<br><br>At the same time that we are busier than ever, there is also a movement toward balancing things out. There&#x2019;s a desire to treat our bodies well and to look after ourselves physically, mentally, and spiritually. And an awful lot of this centers around the food we eat.&nbsp;<br><br>There has been a real shift in the way we look at food. More people are conscious of what they&#x2019;re putting into their shopping baskets, more people are buying seasonally, and more people are cooking at home. For the first time in two generations, home cooking is firmly back in fashion, and an ever-increasing number of people are actively choosing to eat a diet centered around vegetables on at least a few days of the week.&nbsp;<br><br>Making vegetables the focus of our diet is widely considered to be the single most important thing we can do for our own health and for the health of the planet. Over the last couple of years, eating a plant-based diet has moved from the domain of brightly painted vegetarian caf�s to proud center stage.&nbsp;<br><br>I hope this book will show you how to do this in your home without too much fuss. It&#x2019;s packed full of the food I like to eat and the food I like to cook. To my mind, it&#x2019;s this straight-up everyday food that is so important for us to get right and get enthused about. And it&#x2019;s the recipes in this book that I hope will help you cook amazing, achievable meals every night of the week.&nbsp;<br><b>PARSNIP AND POTATO PANCAKE&nbsp;<br></b>SERVES 4 TO 6<br><br>There is something clean and Alpine about a <i>r�sti </i>(potato pancake), while at the same time it is super-satisfying.

Some of us just hide it better than others.</b></p><p>In <i>Suspicious Minds</i>, Rob Brotherton decodes the psychology, history, and consequences of conspiracism, and delves into the research that offers insights into why so many of us are drawn to implausible, unproven and un-provable conspiracy theories. They resonate with some of our brain's built-in quirks and foibles, and tap into some of our deepest desires, fears, and assumptions about the world. </p><p>Conspiracy theorists do not wear tin-foil hats (for the most part). They are not just a few kooks lurking on the paranoid fringes of society with bizarre ideas about shape-shifting reptilian aliens running society in secret. They walk among us. They <i>are</i> us. Everyone loves a good conspiracy. Yet conspiracy theories are not a recent invention. And they are not always a harmless curiosity. </p><p>The fascinating and often surprising psychology of conspiracy theories tells us a lot--not just why we are drawn to theories about sinister schemes, but about how our minds are wired and, indeed, why we believe anything at all. Conspiracy theories are not some psychological aberration--they're a predictable product of how brains work. This book will tell you why, and what it means. Of course, just because your brain&#x2019;s biased doesn&#x2019;t always mean you&#x2019;re wrong. Sometimes conspiracies are real. Sometimes, paranoia is prudent.</p></p><p><p><b>Rob Brotherton </b>is an academic psychologist and science writer who likes to walk on the weird side of psychology.

Chances are you are one.&#x2019;" - <i>TIME</i></p><p>"[Brotherton] casts doubt on the assumption that far-fetched beliefs are reserved for the simple-minded or the exceedingly paranoid . . . Although we like to think our judgments are based on evidence, Brotherton reveals that a host of psychological factors come into play whenever we choose what to believe." - <i>Scientific American</i></p><p>"Brotherton relates the history of conspiracy theories, from the Illuminati and the Great Fire of London to Area 51 and the 9/11 attacks. But he is loath to write off any of these ideas as limited to a lunatic fringe." -<i>Psychology Today</i></p><p>"Clearly written and with liberal use of humor and numerous examples from scholarly research, this title provides a valuable look at why conspiracy theories abound and why we should continually assess our thinking." - starred review, <i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"Brotherton illustrates how incomplete, contradictory, coincidental, and incongruent information can allow people to see conspiracies and connections where there are none, due in part to the theories&#x2019; plausibility and humans&#x2019; innate desire for order . . . While Brotherton might not convince all believers to remove their tinfoil hats (a concept whose origin he explains), it&#x2019;s sure to make readers question their worldview." - starred review, <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"[Brotherton's] writing style is inviting and even cheeky, and the book is a page-turner.

But Maurice Hilleman came close.</p><p>Maurice Hilleman is the father of modern vaccines. Chief among his accomplishments are nine vaccines that practically every child gets, rendering formerly deadly diseases&#x2014;including mumps, rubella, and measles&#x2014;nearly forgotten.&nbsp; Author Paul A. Offit&#x2019;s rich and lively narrative details Hilleman&#x2019;s research and experiences as the basis for a larger exploration of the development of vaccines, covering two hundred years of medical history and traveling across the globe in the process. The history of vaccines necessarily brings with it a cautionary message, as they have come under assault from those insisting they do more harm than good. Paul Offit clearly and compellingly rebuts these arguments, and, by demonstrating how much the work of Hilleman and others has gained for humanity, shows us how much we have to lose.</p></p><p><p>Paul A. Offit, MD, is chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, as well as the acclaimed author of <em>Autism's False Prophets</em>, <em>Vaccinated</em>, and <em>Deadly Choices</em>.</p>*Starred Review* Maurice Hilleman's name isn't well known, and according to infectious disease expert Offit's riveting biography, that is both a shame and a blessing. It's a shame because the outspoken, brilliant, yet humble scientist from Montana invented vaccines that all but wiped out a number of infectious diseases. Thanks to his genius, such diseases as mumps, rubella, measles, and hepatitis A and B no longer claim millions of lives, mostly children's. He merits greater recognition. His obscurity is a blessing because it prevents more people from using his name in vain, for Hilleman's vaccines have recently become increasingly controversial and their efficacy clouded by questions about adverse side effects. Still, Offit pulls no punches in defending Hilleman against those who would crucify him for combining measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines into one shot and for the choice to add thimerosal to extend the shelf life of all vaccines. Despite the fact that Offit's bias on behalf of public health shows, the book is a powerful examination of the kind of single-minded determination it takes to tackle diseases that threaten the world's children. And to do so without bravado&#x2014;no vaccine bears Hilleman's name, no awards his mantle&#x2014;is to define what it is to be simply heroic.

In <i>Buddha</i> she turns to a figure whose thought is still reverberating throughout the world 2,500 years after his death.<p>Many know the Buddha only from seeing countless serene, iconic images. But what of the man himself and the world he lived in? What did he actually do in his roughly eighty years on earth that spawned one of the greatest religions in world history? Armstrong tackles these questions and more by examining the life and times of the Buddha in this engrossing philosophical biography. Against the tumultuous cultural background of his world, she blends history, philosophy, mythology, and biography to create a compelling and illuminating portrait of a man whose awakening continues to inspire millions.<br><br></p></p><p>Books on Buddhism may overflow the shelves, but the life story of the Buddha himself has remained obscure despite over 2,500 years of influence on millions of people around the world. In an attempt to rectify this, and to make the Buddha and Buddhism accessible to Westerners, the beloved scholar and author of such sweeping religious studies as <i>A History of God</i> has written a readable, sophisticated, and somewhat unconventional biography of one of the most influential people of all time. Buddha himself fought against the cult of personality, and the Buddhist scriptures were faithful, giving few details of his life and personality. Karen Armstrong mines these early scriptures, as well as later biographies, then fleshes the story out with an explanation of the cultural landscape of the 6th century B.C., creating a deft blend of biography, history, philosophy, and mythology.<p> At the age of 29, Siddhartha Gautama walked away from the insulated pleasure palace that had been his home and joined a growing force of wandering monks searching for spiritual enlightenment during an age of upheaval. Armstrong traces Gautama's journey through yoga and asceticism and grounds it in the varied religious teachings of the time. In many parts of the world during this so-called axial age, new religions were developing as a response to growing urbanization and market forces. Yet each shared a common impulse--they placed faith increasingly on the individual who was to seek inner depth rather than magical control. Taoism and Confucianism, Hinduism, monotheism in the Middle East and Iran, and Greek rationalism were all emerging as Gautama made his determined way towards enlightenment under the boddhi tree and during the next 45 years that he spent teaching along the banks of the Ganges. Armstrong, in her intelligent and clarifying style, is quick to point out the Buddha's relevance to our own time of transition, struggle, and spiritual void in both his approach--which was based on skepticism and empiricism--and his teachings. </p><p> Despite the lack of typical historical documentation, Armstrong has written a rich and revealing description of both a unique time in history and an unusual man. <i>Buddha</i> is a terrific primer for those interested in the origins and fundamentals of Buddhism. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p><b>Karen Armstrong</b>'s books include <b>The Battle for God, A History of God: The 4000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam; Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths</b>; and <b>In the Beginning: A New Interpretation of Genesis</b>.

If not his private shame at how his life there had gone to hell. He was chief of police in Paradise, Mass.This was his town now. Yet there were still some things about the East Coast and the Atlantic he had never gotten used to and wasn't sure he ever would. Nor'easters, for one. He found their brooding, slate-gray clouds and roiling tides a little unnerving. These late-fall or winter storms seemed to blow up out of spite, raking across whole swaths of New England or the Mid� Atlantic, leaving nothing but pain in their wake.<br><br>As was his habit, he drove through the darkened streets of Paradise&nbsp;in his old Ford Explorer before heading horne. He wanted to get a few hours' sleep before going back to work. Maybe a drink, too. The storm wasn't supposed to make landfall until about midnight, but the winds were bending trees back against their will, sleet already pelting his&nbsp;windshield. Jesse shook his head thinking &nbsp;about that. About how storms in the east warned you they were coming. About how they told you when they were coming and then kicked your ass.<br><br> It was different out west. He remembered how, when he was a kid in Tucson, a few inches of unexpected rain would morph into the cascading wall of a flash flood, washing away everything before it. One minute people would be horseback riding or hiking through bone-dry arroyos and the next they'd &nbsp;be swallowed up by waters squeezed between canyon walls and ground sun baked so mercilessly hard it could not soak up a drop of rain. Jesse remembered that he had once gone out with his dad, searching for some missing hikers after one of the floods. How they had come upon the body of a drowned horse. It had been many years since he had thought of that horse, its carcass rotting in the Arizona sun.<br><br> Then in L.A. there were the choking Santa Ana winds that would blow across the mountains, swoop down into the valleys and through the canyons from the Mojave. The Santa Anas brought destruction with them, too, sucking the moisture out of the vegetation, wildfires following in their path. Fires that would consume whole hillsides, one after the other. Sometimes the winds blew so strongly through the &nbsp;canyons that &nbsp;they howled. His ex-partner used to say it was Satan whistling while he worked. At the moment, Jesse felt about as far away from those Santa An as as a man could get, but he thought he could still hear Satan's whistling in &nbsp;the &nbsp;winds that &nbsp;buffeted his SUV.<br><br> There weren't many cars on the road, but a &nbsp;few brave or stupid souls dared the weather. Jesse knew most of the vehicles. Robbie Wil� son, the fire chief, was out in his red Jeep, looking for trouble. Jesse didn't have much patience for men like Wilson, guys who liked being big fish in tiny ponds. Little men with big chips on both shoulders. Men with something to prove, always on the prowl for a chance to&nbsp;prove it. Jesse could never figure out what it was Robbie Wilson had to prove. He also hated that Wilson refused to call him by his first name, always calling him Chief or Chief Stone.<br><br> Alexia Dragoa, one of the few commercial fishermen who still sailed out of Paradise, was coming from the docks in his ancient F-150.That damned pickup was nearly all rust.The thing was like an old married couple who stayed together more out of habit than any� thing else. No doubt Alexia had been securing his boat, the <i>Dragoa Rainha, </i>in anticipation of the storm. Jesse gave the fisherman a wave in passing. Dragoa, a gruff Portuguese SOB, couldn't be bothered to return the gesture. <i>Par for the course) </i>Jesse thought. <i>Par for the course.<br></i><br> Bill Marchand was out in front of his insurance brokerage on Nan� tucket Street, wrestling the wind for control of a storm shutter. Jesse pulled over to lend him a hand. Bill and Jesse were friendly, if not exactly friends. Jesse didn't have friends, not the way other people had friends. But Marchand &nbsp;sponsored the police softball team and was generous with local charities. In all the years Jesse had served as chief, there hadn't been many town selectmen who'd earned his respect. Most selectmen had proven themselves craven and spineless, rarely backing Jesse or the department in tough situations. Bill Marchand was the exception. He was a thoughtful &nbsp;man who had usually based his support not on the direction of the political currents but on the facts before him.<br><br> "Let me get that for you," Jesse said, pinning the shutter to the wall.<br> &nbsp;<br> "Thanks, Jesse. It's &nbsp;gonna be a bad one, this nor'easter. You been through enough of these, you can smell it on the wind."<br><br> "One is &nbsp;enough of these." Jesse used his free hand to lift up the fleece-lined collar of his jacket against the sleet. The wind was gust� ing more intensely. "Ready for the shutter?" Jesse asked.<br><br> "I've got the latch ready."<br> &nbsp;<br> Jesse forced the shutter closed, Marchand helping the last foot or&nbsp;two. When the shutter was in place, the insurance broker latched it closed.<br><br> "I hope the damned thing holds. I've had to replace these shutters&nbsp;twice," Marchand said, raising his voice above the wind.<br> &nbsp;<br> 'Trn sure your insurance will cover it."<br> &nbsp;<br> "You're a funny man, Jesse Stone. Thanks again," Marchand said, offeringJesse his gloved right hand. "It's gonna be a bad one, all right. I'll be busy for weeks after this. We'll have to call adjusters in from all over the States. You watch yourself out there."<br><br> But it was Jesse's job &nbsp;to watch out for everyone else. He waited for Marchand &nbsp;to get into his massive Infiniti SUV and drive offbefore pulling away himself. <i>As </i>Jesse was about to turn for horne, he caught sight of another vehicle he recognized. It was John Millner's beat-up Chevy van. Millner was a career criminal, a petty thief who'd been in and out of commonwealth correctional facilities during Jesse's tenure as chie� Millner was from the Swap-Southwest Area of Paradise� the only rough part of town. But even the Swap was changing. It was turning into a hipper, more ethnically diverse part of Paradise. Mill� ner's family was old-school Swap and John was more a lowlife than a tough guy. A parasite, an opportunist, not a mastermind.<br><br> Jesse followed the white van at a distance up into the bluffs that overlooked the ocean and the rest of town to the south. The Bluffs were where the rich founders of Paradise had built their big fussy houses more than a &nbsp;century and a half ago. Most of those families were gone, their manses knocked down, properties long since sold off. A few, like the Salter place, remained &nbsp;as summer homes. Many had fallen into disrepair.<br><br> Millner's van pulled off the road by a &nbsp;darkened behemoth &nbsp;of a house: the old Rutherford place. It had been vacant for Jesse's entire tenure in Paradise. For years there had been efforts by the town's his� torical society to get it named to the commonwealth's register of&nbsp;historical places, but those avenues had finally been exhausted, and come spring the Rutherford place would be demolished. Jesse had a pretty good idea of what Millner meant to get up to. Giant old houses were lined with miles of copper wiring and other metals that could be sold off to scrap dealers at good prices. The problem for crooked scav� engers like Millner &nbsp;was opportunity. &nbsp;You needed time to &nbsp;break through plaster walls and lath to get to the wiring. And a big storm had opportunity written all over it. Emergency situations stretched the cops thin, especially small-town forces like the Paradise PD.<br><br> Normally, Jesse would &nbsp;have given Millner enough rope to hang himself. He would have let him break into the condemned house before arresting him, but Jesse didn't have time for that now, not with the storm blowing in. When Millner, all six-foot-six of him, got out of his vehicle and went to swing open the van's side door,Jesse shined his Maglite in the thief's face.<br><br> "Who the hell is that?" asked Millner, holding his hand before his eyes to block the light.<br><br> "It's Chief Stone, John. What are you doing here?"<br> &nbsp;<br> Millner hemmed and hawed, thinking of any reasonable lie. "Don't bother," Jesse said. 'Tm &nbsp;not in the mood for your crap.<br><br> Consider yourself lucky I don't want to deal with youtonight. Now get out of here and don't let any of my people catch your ass &nbsp;up here again."<br><br> Millner didn't say a word, just got back into his van and drove away down toward town. Jesse watched the van's taillights until they disappeared. Then &nbsp;he stepped to the edge of the bluff on which the Rutherford house stood. He looked out at the vast blackness of the Atlantic. He listened to the bones of the old house creak in the wind, listened to the wind whistling through the broken windows. He thought he heard the devil at work. He decided he really needed that drink.<br><br> &nbsp;<br>2<br><br><i>He supposed they were all </i>thinking the same thing: This can't be hap� pening. Not again. Not after all these years. But it <i>was </i>happening, only this time they weren't a bunch of kids with too much Southern Comfort and Thai stick in them. That first time, it was some inno� cent fun gone sideways. Severely sideways, plunging them into a para� lyzing hell with slick, jagged walls from which there would be no escape. None. Not ever. That they were here to kill their old friend proved as much.<br><br> They had been given a temporary reprieve, a cruel reprieve, lasting just long enough to fool them into believing they had put real dis� tance between that old evil and the fragile lives they had built in the meantime. Lives that &nbsp;included wives and lovers, children, careers, small successes, and grander failures, but haunted &nbsp;lives just the same. Haunted because distance from evil is &nbsp;a myth of time, because they&nbsp;were never more than one restless night or, worse still, a tainted moment of joy away from it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> The wind rattled the windows and the loading bay door. The&nbsp;plinking of sleet was less urgent now that the snow was falling in sheets and collecting on the corrugated &nbsp;metal roo� Raw, cold air seeped into the maintenance shed like an accusation and made heav� ing clouds of their breath. Small plumes of breath carne from the mouth of the nude man on the floor at their feet. His wrists and ankles were trussed behind him and his sun-streaked brown hair was caked with the drying blood that had leaked from the welt at &nbsp;the base of his skull. His broken lower jaw was unhinged, his mouth a wreck of splintered teeth and bone. After the pipe had been laid into him, the spray ofblood had given the air a coppery tang that the two other men could almost taste. But the blood had settled out of the air like silt out of water. Now the place smelled only ofburnt black motor oil, gasoline fumes, and antifreeze.<br>&nbsp;<br> "What'd you do with his clothes?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "The furnace in the church." "His duffel bag?"<br>&nbsp;<br> "It's a &nbsp;big furnace. Burnt that up, too. Nothing but old smelly clothes and a Bible, anyways."<br>&nbsp;<br> "Okay, drag that canvas over here and wrap it around his head."<br> &nbsp;<br> "You really gonna do this?"<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>"We </i>are."<br> &nbsp;<br> "But that's Zevon, man. He was our friend once."<br> &nbsp;<br> "Friends don't come back to town to fuck up everyone else's lives. If he wanted to stay my friend, he should have stayed lost. You may not have anything to lose, but I do."<br>&nbsp;<br> <b>"But-"</b><br> &nbsp;<br> "But nothing. We talked this through. We all agreed. It's &nbsp;too late&nbsp;now, anyway. He's already more than &nbsp;half dead. Now get the canvas and do what I told you.The storm's blowing in faster than we thought and he's going to be here soon to get rid of the body. C'mon."<br>&nbsp;<br> The unconscious man moaned a little as the coarse, mildewed fab�ric was wrapped around his head. "What's the canvas for, anyways?" "Think about it."<br>&nbsp;<br> "Oh."<br> &nbsp;<br> "Exactly. You got the tarp ready for him? The rope?" "Yeah."<br><br>Outside there was already six inches on the ground and the roads were slick from the layer of sleet that had come before the snow. As he swung around to back up to the bay door, he checked his rearview mirror and saw two quick flashes of lightning and heard two muted claps of thunder. It was done. Zevon was dead. Now the time had come to play his part in keeping the past buried. Yet he understood that this particular episode of thunder and lightning, like their prior sins, was of their own doing and pushed them even further away from heaven than they already were. That &nbsp;the past was unrelenting and that no grave was deep enough to keep it buried forever.<br><br> &nbsp;<br>3<br>&nbsp;<br> <i>Jesse &nbsp;hadn't slept </i>a wink after getting horne. He hadn't tried. He did manage to polish off two Black Labels. That's why he'd headed horne in the first place. Sleep hadn't ever been a part of the plan, not really. It was always about the drinks. Drinkers are great rationalizers, spin� ning tales that only they will hear. Tales only they would believe.Jesse kept a bottle of something in his desk drawer at the station, but he didn't generally prefer drink at work or when the sun was up. Corning horne, having a drink before dinner, then one or two afterward, was sometimes how he got through the day. He knew his bottle of John� nie Walker was horne waiting for him like a faithful wife. He'd had a wife once, just not a faithful one.<br>&nbsp;<br> His ritual entailed pouring the drink-sometimes on the rocks, sometimes in a tall glass with soda-stirring it with his finger, licking the scotch off his finger, raising a toast to his poster of Ozzie Smith, and taking that first sip. Sometimes he savored it. Sometimes, like&nbsp;that night, it was open wide and down the hatch. Any confirmed drinker knows that ritual is &nbsp;as integral to the addiction as the drink� ing itself. Dix was fond of saying that ritual was a secondary reinforce� ment. Jesse laughed at the notion of secondary reinforcement. He liked the drinking well enough all &nbsp;by itself.

For the next three years, he would face the horrors of war as a black soldier in a segregated army.<br> <br>He endured the terrible lies white officers told about the black soldiers to isolate them from anyone who showed kindness&#x2014;including each other. He received worse treatment than even Nazi POWs. He was assigned the grimmest, most horrific tasks, like burying fallen soldiers...but was told to remove the black soldiers first because the media didn&#x2019;t want them in their newsreels. And he waited and wanted so desperately to go home, watching every white soldier get safe passage back to the United States before black soldiers were even a thought.<br> <br>For the next forty years, Ashley would keep his time in the war a secret. But now, he tells his story.<br> <br>The story of the kind people who supported him.<br> The story of the bright moments that guided him through the dark.<br> And the story of his passion for art that would save him time and time again.<br> <br>Filled with never-before-seen artwork and handwritten letters and diary entries, this illuminating and moving memoir by Newbery Honor&#x2013;winning illustrator Ashley Bryan is both a lesson in history and a testament to hope.</p><p>Ashley Bryan grew up to the sound of his mother singing from morning to night, and he has shared the joy of song with children ever since.

A talented writer who turns fact into entertainment, she has traveled across the country to research topics as diverse as deep-sea submersibles, the largest tree in the world, and more. Gail Gibbons divides her time between a cottage on Matinicus Island off the coast of Maine and a farmhouse in Vermont surrounded by sugar maple trees.Ages 4^-8. Like dinosaurs, knights, with their castles, horses, armor, and weaponry, have always been a source of fascination for children, but they haven't been explored much in books at the preschool and primary level. Gibbons gives kids the information they crave--beginning with the when and the why knights wore armor. She covers tournaments, chivalry, and what happened when a bad knight was caught. Legendary knights such as Sir Gawain and the knights of the Round Table are briefly described, as is St. George and the dragon, and Gibbons also discusses present-day knights. The watercolor-and-ink pictures are some of Gibbons' liveliest and most attractive: there's plenty of fighting, decorative clothing and heraldry, and clear labels pointing out the parts of a castle and the names of the armor pieces. Children won't want to surrender this book, so buy multiple copies. <i>Susan Dove Lempke</i></p><h2>Emanon Volume 1</h2><p><b>A new series begins from the artist of the Eisner-nominated <i>Wandering Island</i>!</b><br><br>The year is 1967, and a young Japanese man is thinking about the future.

All four canonical Gospels declare that the Torah and the Prophets and the Psalms mysteriously prefigure Jesus. The author of the Fourth Gospel states this claim succinctly: in his narrative, Jesus declares, "If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me" (John 5:46). Yet modern historical criticism characteristically judges that the New Testament&#x2019;s christological readings of Israel&#x2019;s Scripture misrepresent the original sense of the texts; this judgment forces fundamental questions to be asked: Why do the Gospel writers read&nbsp;the Scriptures in such surprising ways? Are their readings intelligible as coherent or persuasive interpretations of the Scriptures? Does Christian faith require the illegitimate theft of someone else&#x2019;s sacred texts?<br>&nbsp;<br> <i>Echoes of Scripture in the Gospels&nbsp;</i>answers these questions. Richard B. Hays chronicles the dramatically different ways the four Gospel writers interpreted Israel&#x2019;s Scripture and reveals that their readings were as complementary as they were&nbsp;faithful. In this long-awaited sequel to his <i>Echoes of Scripture in the Letters of Paul</i>, Hays&nbsp;highlights the theological consequences of the Gospel writers&#x2019;&nbsp;distinctive hermeneutical approaches and asks what it might mean for contemporary readers to attempt to read Scripture through the eyes of the Evangelists. In particular, Hays carefully describes the Evangelists&#x2019;&nbsp;practice of&nbsp; <i>figural reading</i>&#x2015;an imaginative and retrospective move that creates narrative continuity and wholeness. He shows how each Gospel artfully uses scriptural echoes to re-narrate Israel&#x2019;s story, to assert that Jesus is the embodiment of Israel&#x2019;s God, and to prod the church in its vocation to engage the pagan world.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hays shows how the Evangelists summon readers to a conversion of their imagination. The Evangelists&#x2019;&nbsp;use of scriptural echo beckons readers to believe the extraordinary: that Jesus was Israel&#x2019;s Messiah, that Jesus is Israel&#x2019;s God, and that contemporary believers are still on mission. The Evangelists, according to Hays, are training our scriptural senses, calling readers to be better scriptural people by being better scriptural poets.</p></p><p><p>Richard B. Hays, George Washington Ivey Professor of New Testament at Duke Divinity School, is internationally recognized for his work on the letters of Paul and on New Testament ethics. His scholarship has bridged the disciplines of biblical criticism and literary studies, exploring the innovative ways in which early Christian writers interpreted Israel&#x2019;s Scripture. His works include <i>Echoes of Scripture in the Letters of Paul</i> (Yale University Press, 1989), <i>The Conversion of the Imagination: Paul as Interpreter of Israel&#x2019;s Scripture</i> (Eerdmans, 2005), and <i>Reading Backwards: Figural Christology and the Fourfold Gospel Witness</i> (Baylor University Press, 2014).</p><p>A precious book that presents a learned proposal for the figural interpretation of the Synoptics and John.</p> (Boris Paschke <i>Evangelical Review of Theology</i>)<br><br><p>This is a book to be savored, not rushed through like fast food. At one point, Hays describes the benefit of reading John&#x2019;s narrative &#x2018;attentively.&#x2019; This book demonstrates Hays&#x2019;s attentive reading of the evangelists interpreting and using Scripture... Hays&#x2019;s work will be useful for those studying one or more of the Gospels and for those researching the use of the Scriptures of Israel in the NT. Failure to engage with Hays would be a mistake.</p> (Kenneth D. Litwak <i>Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society</i>)<br><br><p>What cannot be overstated about Hays' book is the fresh way in which his methodology elucidates nuanced meaning in the Gospels as echoes of the larger story of Israel while also offering plain interpretation of standard passages. Hays' work in figural echoing is innovative, whisking a Gospel reader into other parts of scripture against standard hermeneutical practice such as grammatical-historic approaches.</p> (Thomas J. Savage <i>European Journal of Theology</i>)<br><br><p>Everyone should read <i>Echoes of Scripture in the Gospel</i>s; it is a masterpiece in figural interpretation.</p> (Dean Deppe <i>Calvin Theological Journal</i>)<br><br><p>In this much anticipated project, Hays does for the Gospels what he previously and famously did for Paul. He investigates how the four evangelists, each in a distinctive way, operated as biblical interpreters, bearing witness to Jesus and his gospel in light of the Old Testament&#x2019;s witness.</p> (<i>The Christian Century</i>)<br><br><p>This is a remarkable book for the many fresh lines of interpretative possibilities that Hays presents.</p> (Peter R. Rodgers <i>Novum Testamentum</i>)<br><br><p>This is a superb and important book for a truly Christian way of understanding the Scriptures.</p> (<i>The Bible Today</i>)<br><br><p>There is subtlety and depth here, achieved only through extensive awareness of Israel&#x2019;s Scriptures and the ways they can be reconfigured in the Gospels.</p> (Micah D. Kiel <i>Catholic Biblical Quarterly</i>)<br><br><p>Combined with the detailed analysis of possible verbal correspondences in various texts, Hays offers a richly theological reading of the Gospels that will be of great benefit to preachers.</p> (Alistair I. Wilson <i>Scottish Bulletin of Evangelical Theology</i>)<br><br><p>Hays promises the reader an examination of the Evangelists&#x2019; hermeneutics and delivers so much more&#x2015;the veritable foundation, outline and central details for a biblical theology of the Gospels.</p> (Craig L.

The result is an extraordinary story of healing and communication that turns our conventional understanding of these amazing creatures upside down.<br>A horse trainer and equine-facilitated therapy practitioner, Kohanov first began exploring the horse human connection in the early 1990s. When her black mare, Rasa, became lame, Kohanov was plagued by a series of sinister dreams and premonitions. Finally, prompted by her dreams, she canceled a risky surgery to save Rasa's potential career in competitive riding. To relate to the injured horse outside conventional equestrian pursuits, Kohanov immersed herself in the day-to-day activities of the herd. In the process, she discovered that horses are intensely emotional, intuitive, intelligent beings. They are true reflections of our deepest souls. Over time, she discovered their extraordinary ability to awaken intuition in humans, while mirroring the authentic feelings people try to hide, makes these animals powerful therapeutic teachers.</p><p><i>The Tao of Equus</i>, which literally translates as "the way of the horse," explores the possibility that horses are highly evolved, spiritual beings who offer humans opportunities for healing and personal growth. Linda Kohanov is the owner of Epona Equestrian Services, an Arizona-based collective of trainers and counselors that explore the therapeutic potential of equestrian pursuits. Although she does discuss horse training and horse behavior, Kohanov is most interested in what horses can teach us. Moving beyond the realm of horse whispering, Kohanov studies how horses awaken intuition in humans while also mirroring our unspoken feelings and fears. At its core, this book reminds us to be mindful as we approach the horse-human relationship. Like human-to-human relationships, we have to do our own personal and spiritual work before we can expect to create a meaningful and cooperative interspecies connection. Kohanov is a steadfast writer who isn't shy about claiming a strong feminine approach, showing how mythology and history are filled with examples of powerful woman-horse connections. She also has the courage to reveal her paranormal experiences with these intensely emotional and intuitive animals--stories that may sound familiar to anyone who has ever loved and dreamed of horses. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>"A startling challenge to anyone wishing to limit consciousness to humans."<br> -- <b>Larry Dossey, MD</b> <br><br> "Linda Kohanov's stories about the mystery of healing and transformation between human and horse are extraordinary, magical. Linda has done her homework, and her book stands well on its research, but it dances on its stories. A book that can change minds, hearts, and attitudes."<br> -- <b>Susan Chernak McElroy</b>, author of <i>Animals as Teachers and Healers</i> <br><br> "This work represents an extraordinarily moving account of a gifted thinker, writer, teacher, and horsewoman who dares to venture deep within to explore the truth of the connection that merges horse, human, emotion, and spirit."<br> -- <b><i>Riding</i></b> <br><br> "<i>The Tao of Equus</i> is part memoir, part literature, mythology, and philosophy lesson, and part psychology text. More than anything, [Linda Kohanov] had the courage to investigate dreams and visions many may dismiss. As you read, you'll ponder your own dreams and coincidences, and consider what your horse may be waiting to teach you."<br> -- <b><i>Horse &amp; Rider</i></b> <br><br> "This articulate, well-researched story brings together many disciplines of learning and weaves a magic carpet for discovery with our horses. <i>The Tao of Equus</i> will allow your imagination to take flight, and give you insight into yourself and your equine partner."<br> -- <b><i>The Equestrian News</i></b> <br><br> "This inspirational book would make an excellent gift not only for horse lovers, but for anyone dealing with fundamental questions of grief, sadness, and healing."<br> -- <b><i>BookPage</i></b> <br><br> "Effective psychotherapy 'contains' a mysterious energy that synchronously interweaves the interaction of therapist and client. Linda Kohanov takes us on a marvelous excursion of her evolutionary relationship with horses, highlighting equine-facilitated psychotherapy and the Tao energy that horses have to offer in the service of this work. I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in innovative psychotherapy and more than just a superficial look at horses."<br> -- <b>Fred P.

From his explorations on the yoga mat and in 12-Step rooms, he found a path to sustainable recovery that includes mind-body practices, a profound look at diet, and a more holistic and inclusive perspective on the 12 Steps. This led him to realize that recovery happens in stages, and that by utilizing the best practices of the 12 Steps in combination with yoga and meditation, he could achieve lasting freedom from addiction. In Recovery 2.0, Tommy shares his own past struggles with addiction and the powerful insights that helped him to identify and break free from the obstacles that stand in the way of recovery. Building off the key tenets of the 12-Step program, he lays out an innovative approach where deeper levels of detoxification and transformation allow you to uproot addiction and thrive. In these pages, you&#x2019;ll find: �A new way of looking at addiction as a vibratory frequency that has roots in family history and one&#x2019;s "Addiction Story," which helps to destigmatize addiction and remove associated guilt and shame. �Fresh perspectives on how to get the most out of the 12-Step teachings and community, while avoiding pitfalls. �Daily practices in breathing, meditation, and yoga that will give you access to the extraordinary power within you. �A pathway to a newer, healthier relationship with food designed to boost immunity, increase vitality, support recovery, and prevent relapse. �Inspiration to help you discover your personal mission and be of service to others.The point is not to survive addiction.

She and her husband divide their time between Vermont and Maine.Grade 2-4-In straightforward, clear prose and colorful, text-related illustrations, Gibbons describes the formation and physical features of caves. Some of the pictures are labeled, and many depict people of varying ages exploring the different kinds of subterranean spaces. Plant and animal life found underground is briefly mentioned. The term "spelunker" is defined; oddly, "cavern" is not. Rules and supplies needed for spelunking are given, along with a short list of caves for enthusiasts to visit. Unfortunately, Gibbons's popular, child-friendly style is somewhat marred by unexplained circles (flashlights? spotlights?) that appear in each illustration.

His intention was to grow rubber, but the project rapidly evolved into a more ambitious bid to export America itself, along with its golf courses, ice-cream shops, bandstands, indoor plumbing, and Model Ts rolling down broad streets. </p><p>Fordlandia, as the settlement was called, quickly became the site of an epic clash. On one side was the car magnate, lean, austere, the man who reduced industrial production to its simplest motions; on the other, the Amazon, lush, extravagant, the most complex ecological system on the planet. Ford's early success in imposing time clocks and square dances on the jungle soon collapsed, as indigenous workers, rejecting his midwestern Puritanism, turned the place into a ribald tropical boomtown. Fordlandia's eventual demise as a rubber plantation foreshadowed the practices that today are laying waste to the rain forest. </p><p>More than a parable of one man's arrogant attempt to force his will on the natural world, <i>Fordlandia</i> depicts a desperate quest to salvage the bygone America that the Ford factory system did much to dispatch. As Greg Grandin shows in this gripping and mordantly observed history, Ford's great delusion was not that the Amazon could be tamed but that the forces of capitalism, once released, might yet be contained. <br><i>Fordlandia</i> is a 2009 National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, June 2009:</strong> Proving that truth can indeed be stranger than fiction, <em>Fordlandia</em> is the story of Henry Ford's ill-advised attempt to transform raw Brazilian rainforest into homespun slices of Americana. With sales of his Model-T booming, the automotive tycoon saw an opportunity to expand his reach further by exploiting a downtrodden Brazilian rubber industry. His vision, the laughably-named Amazonian outpost of Fordlandia, would become an enviable symbol of efficiency and mark the Ford Motor Company as a player on the global stage. Or so he thought. With thoughtful and meticulous research, author Greg Grandin explores the astounding oversights (no botanists were consulted to confirm the colony's agricultural viability) and painful arrogance (little thought was paid to how native Brazilians would react to an American way of life) that hamstrung the project from the start. Instead of ushering in a new era of commerce, Fordlandia became a cautionary tale of a dream destroyed by hubris. --<em>Dave Callanan</em> <br><br> <p><b>Take a Closer Look at Images from <i>Fordlandia: The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford's Forgotten Jungle City</i></b></p>(Click on images to enlarge) <br><br><br><table><tbody><tr> <td> <br>A sketch of the opera house in Manus,<br>Brazil (aka.

Incorporating meticulous research and well-documented sources&#x2014;including newspaper and magazine articles, radio speeches, memoirs, and diaries&#x2014;the book juxtaposes hundreds of interrelated moments of decision, brutality, suffering, and mercy. Vivid glimpses of political leaders and their dissenters illuminate and examine the gradual, horrifying advance toward overt global war and Holocaust.<br> <br>Praised by critics and readers alike for his exquisitely observant eye and deft, inimitable prose, Baker has assembled a narrative within <i>Human Smoke</i> that unfolds gracefully, tragically, and persuasively. This is an unforgettable book that makes a profound impact on our perceptions of historical events and mourns the unthinkable loss humanity has borne at its own hand.</p><p><b>Nicholson Baker</b> is the author of nine novels and four works of nonfiction, including <i>Double Fold, </i>which won a National Book Critics Circle Award, and <i>House of Holes</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year. His work has appeared in&nbsp;<i>The&nbsp;New Yorker</i>, <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i>, and <i>The New York Review of Books</i>.&nbsp;He lives in Maine with his family.Alfred Nobel, the manufacturer of explosives, was talking to his friend the Baroness Bertha von Suttner, author of <i>Lay Down Your Arms</i>. Von Suttner, a founder of the European antiwar movement, had just attended the fourth World's Peace Conference in Bern. It was August 1892.<p>"Perhaps my factories will put an end to war even sooner than your congresses," Alfred Nobel said. "On the day when two army corps may mutually annihilate each other in a second, probably all civilized nations will recoil with horror and disband their troops."</p><p>Stefan Zweig, a young writer from Vienna, sat in the audience at a movie theater in Tours, France, watching a newsreel. It was spring 1914.</p><p>An image of Wilhelm II, the Emperor of Germany, came on screen for a moment. At once the theater was in an uproar. "Everybody yelled and whistled, men, women, and children, as if they had been personally insulted," Zweig wrote. "The good-natured people of Tours, who knew no more about the world and politics than what they had read in their newspapers, had gone mad for an instant."</p><p>Zweig was frightened. "It had only been a second, but one that showed me how easily people anywhere could be aroused in a time of a crisis, despite all attempts at understanding."</p><p>Winston Churchill, England's first lord of the admiralty, instituted a naval blockade of Germany. "The British blockade," Churchill later wrote, "treated the whole of Germany as if it were a beleaguered fortress, and avowedly sought to starve the whole population -- men, women, and children, old and young, wounded and sound -- into submission." It was 1914.</p><p>Stefan Zweig was at the eastern front, gathering Russian war proclamations for the Austrian archives. It was the spring of 1915.</p><p>Zweig boarded a freight car on a hospital train. "One crude stretcher stood next to the other," he wrote, "and all were occupied by moaning, sweating, deathly pale men, who were gasping for breath in the thick atmosphere of excrement and iodoform." There were several dead among the living. The doctor, in despair, asked Zweig to get water. He had no morphine and no clean bandages, and they were still twenty hours from Budapest.</p><p>When Zweig got back to Vienna, he began a pacifist play, <i>Jeremiah</i>. "I had recognized," Zweig wrote, "the foe I was to fight -- false heroism that prefers to send others to suffering and death, the cheap optimism of the conscienceless prophets, both political and military who, boldly promising victory, prolong the war, and behind them the hired chorus, the 'word makers of war' as Werfel has pilloried them in his beautiful poem."</p><p>Jeannette Rankin of Montana, the first woman to be elected to the House of Representatives, voted against declaring war on Germany. It was April 6, 1917.</p><p>"I leaned over the gallery rail and watched her," said her friend Harriet Laidlaw, of the Woman Suffrage Party. "She was undergoing the most terrible strain." Almost all of her fellow suffrage leaders, including Laidlaw, wanted her to vote yes.</p><p>There was a silence when her name was called. "I want to stand by my country," Rankin said. "But I cannot vote for war. I vote no." Fifty other members of the House voted no with her; 374 voted yes. "I felt," she said later, "that the first time the first woman had a chance to say no to war she should say it."</p><p>One of her home-state papers, the Helena Independent, called her "a dupe of the Kaiser, a member of the Hun army in the United States, and a crying schoolgirl."</p><p>A young pro-war preacher, Harry Emerson Fosdick, wrote a short book, published by the Young Men's Christian Association.</p><p>War was not gallantry and parades anymore, Reverend Fosdick said. "War is now dropping bombs from aeroplanes and killing women and children in their beds; it is shooting by telephonic orders, at an unseen place miles away and slaughtering invisible men." War, he said, is "men with jaws gone, eyes gone, limbs gone, minds gone."</p><p>Fosdick ended his book with a call for enlistment: "Your country needs <i>you</i>," he said. It was November 1917.</p><p>Meyer London, a socialist in the House of Representatives, voted no to President Wilson's second declaration of war, against Austria-Hungary. It was December 7, 1917.</p><p>"In matters of war I am a teetotaler," said London, in a fifteen-minute speech. "I refuse to take the first intoxicating drink."</p><p>Representative Walter Chandler walked over to where London sat and stood in front of him as he delivered his rebuttal.</p><p>"It has been said that if you will analyze the blood of a Jew under the microscope, you will find the Talmud and the Old Bible floating around in some particles," Congressman Chandler said. "If you analyze the blood of a representative German or Teuton you will find machine guns and particles of shells and bombs floating around in the blood."</p><p>There was only one thing to do with the Teutons, according to Chandler: "Fight them until you destroy the whole bunch."</p><p>Eleanor Roosevelt and her husband, Franklin D., the assistant secretary of the navy, were invited to a party in honor of Bernard Baruch, the financier. "I've got to go to the Harris party which I'd rather be hung than seen at," Eleanor wrote her mother-in-law. "Mostly Jews." It was January 14, 1918.</p><p>A captured German officer was talking to a reporter for <i>The New York Times</i>. It was November 3, 1918, and the German government had asked for an armistice.</p><p>The German officer claimed that his army was not defeated and should have continued the war. "The Emperor is surrounded by people who feel and talk defeat," the offi cer said. He mentioned men like Philipp Scheidemann, the leader of the socialists.</p><p>New tanks were coming, the captured officer observed, and war was expected between the United States and Japan. "Japan and the United States would surely clash some day," he said, "and we would then furnish both sides with enormous quantities of material and munitions." The ceding of Poland and Alsace-Lorraine, the officer believed, meant social upheaval, the ruin of German industry, and the impoverishment of the working class. "Our enemies will have what they have desired -- the complete annihilation of Germany. That would be a peace due to Scheidemann."</p><p>Winston Churchill, now England's secretary of state for war and air, rose in Parliament to talk about the success of the naval blockade. It was March 3, 1919, four months after the signing of the armistice that ended the Great War.</p><p>"We are enforcing the blockade with rigour," Churchill said. "It is repugnant to the British nation to use this weapon of starvation, which falls mainly on the women and children, upon the old and the weak and the poor, after all the fi ghting has stopped, one moment longer than is necessary to secure the just terms for which we have fought." Hunger and malnutrition, the secretary of war and air observed, had brought German national life to a state of near collapse. "Now is therefore the time to settle," he said.</p><p>Winston Churchill published a newspaper article. It was February 8, 1920. Churchill had a different enemy now. Now his enemy wasn't Germany, it was the "sinister confederacy" of international Jewry.</p><p>"This movement among the Jews is not new," Churchill said. It was a "world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality." He listed Marx, Trotsky, B�la Kun, Rosa Luxemburg, and Emma Goldman as some of the malefactors. The conspiracy had been, he said, the "mainspring of every subversive movement during the Nineteenth Century." It had played a recognizable part in the French Revolution. All loyal Jews, he advised, must "vindicate the honour of the Jewish name" by rejecting international bolshevism.</p><p>Aylmer Haldane, the commander of British forces in Iraq, telegraphed Winston Churchill for more troops and airplanes. It was August 26, 1920.</p><p>"Jihad was being preached with frenzied fervour by the numerous emissaries from the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala," Haldane wrote. Churchill, secretary of state for war and air, sent him an encouraging note: "The Cabinet have decided that the rebellion must be quelled effectually, and I shall endeavour to meet all your requirements."</p><p>Several days later, Churchill wrote Hugh "Boom" Trenchard, the head of the Royal Air Force, a memo. Churchill and Trenchard were developing the notion of policing the British empire from above, thereby saving the cost of ground troops -- a policy that became known as "air control."</p><p>"I think you should certainly proceed with the experimental work on gas bombs, especially mustard gas, which would inflict punishment on recalcitrant natives without inflicting grave injury on them," Churchill wrote Trenchard. Churchill was an expert on the effects of mustard gas -- he knew that it could blind and kill, especially children and infants. Gas spreads a "lively terror," he pointed out in an earlier memo; he didn't understand the prevailing squeamishness about its use: "I am strongly in favor of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes." Most of those gassed wouldn't have "serious permanent effects," he said.</p><p>Haldane's men bombed and strafed rebellious tribes, fired on them with gas-filled shells, burned villages, and repaired the railway. The official death toll on the British side was forty-seven English officers and troops and 250 Indian Gurkhas. "It is impossible to give the Arab casualties with any approach to exactitude," Haldane wrote, "but they have been estimated at 8450 killed and wounded." Haldane offered his thoughts on how to deal punitively with a village. "Separate parties should be detailed for firing the houses, digging up and burning the grain and bhoosa, looting, &amp;c.," he advised. "Burning a village properly takes a long time, an hour or more according to size from the time the burning parties enter."</p><p>Churchill wrote Haldane a congratulatory telegram: "During these diffi cult months your patience and steadfastness have been of great value, and I congratulate you upon the distinct improvement in the situation which has been effected by you." It was October 18, 19...</p></p><h2>The Soul of the Indian (Native American)</h2><p>Raised among the Sioux until the age of 15, Charles Alexander Eastman (1858&#x2013;1939) resolved to become a physician in order to be of the greatest service to his people. Upon completing his education at Boston University School of Medicine, he accepted an appointment to a South Dakota Indian reservation, where he was the only doctor available to the victims of the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee. With the encouragement of his wife, he further distinguished himself both as a writer and as a uniquely qualified interpreter of Native American ways. His writings offer authentic, sometimes stirring views of a world that has forever changed.<br>In <i>The Soul of the Indian</i>, Eastman brings to life the rich spirituality and morality of the Native Americans as they existed before contact with missionaries and other whites. This is a rare firsthand expression of native religion, without the filters imposed by translators or anthropologists. Rather than a scientific treatise, Eastman has written a book, "as true as I can make it to my childhood teaching and ancestral ideals, but from the human, not the ethnological standpoint." His discussions of the forms of ceremonial and symbolic worship, the unwritten scriptures, and the spirit world emphasize the universal quality and personal appeal of Native American religion.</p><p><p><strong>Charles Alexander Eastman </strong>(1858-1939) was born on the Santee Reservation in Minnesota. His grandparents raised him after his mother's death and his father's capture during the Minnesota Sioux uprising. At the age of fifteen, he was reunited with his father and embarked on a life in white man's society. He became a doctor and spent the rest of his life helping Indian people cope with the changes to their world and trying to reconcile the opposing values and beliefs of white society and Sioux culture.</p><br><br><p><strong>Scott Peterson</strong> is an actor experienced in theater, modern dance, and voice-over.

They deal with such topics as discovering where to start and end a story; learning when to use dialogue and when to use indirect discourse; transforming real events into fiction; and finding language that both sings and communicates precisely. <i>What If? </i>will be an essential addition to every writer's library, a welcome and much-used companion, a book that gracefully borrows a whisper from the muse.</p><p><p>Anne Bernays, a novelist and writing teacher, is the author of eight novels, including <em>Professor Romeo</em> and <em>Growing Up Rich,</em> as well as two works of nonfiction, including <em>The Language of Names</em> written with Justin Kaplan and <em>What If?</em> written with Pamela Painter. Her articles and essays have appeared in numerous major publications, among them <em>The Nation,</em> the <em>New York Times, Town &amp; Country,</em> and <em>Sports Illustrated.</em> She lives in Cambridge and Truro, Massachusetts with her husband, Justin Kaplan. They have three daughters and six grandchildren.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>First sentences are doors to worlds. -Ursula K. Le Guin</p><p>New writers oftne find beginnings difficult--whether they're starting a story or a novel--because they take the word "beginning" too literally. They cast around for the "beginning" of a story--forgetting that beginnings rarely have the necessary ingredients for trouble, for conflict, or for complication. Your story can begin with dialogue, narrative summary, description, whatever, but it must begin <i>in medias res, </i>in the middle of things. You must resist the temptation to give the reader too lengthy an explanation as to how things got to this point. Remember, you are trying to hook the reader's attention, to pull the reader into your story so that he won't wonder, <i>What's on television tonight?</i></p><p>Another stumbling block to beginning a story is that new writers think they have to know where their story is going and how it will end--before they begin. Not true. Flannery O'Connor says, "If you start with a real personality, a real character, then something is bound to happen; and you don't have to know what before you begin. In fact, it may be better if you don't know what before you begin. You ought to be able to discover something from your stories. If you don't, probably nobody else will."</p><p>The following exercises are designed to encourage you to think about real characters who are involved in situations that are already under way--situations that are starting to unravel because of, or in spite of, the desires and actions of their beleaguered characters. Don't worry about middles or endings yet. Just give yourself over to setting stories in motion--you will soon know which stories capture your imagination and seem unstoppable, which stories demand to be finished. Till that time, begin and begin and begin.</p></p><h2>Compelled by Love: How to change the world through the simple power of love in action</h2><p>Compelled by Love, the true story of the ministry of Heidi and Rolland Baker in the war-torn, poverty and disease-stricken country of Mozambique, chronicles twenty-seven years of ministry among the poorest people on earth. The book is based upon the beatitudes as seen through the eyes of third-world pastors and missionaries. The Bakers have experienced God&#x2019;s miraculous provision of food to thousands, brought physical healing and spiritual wholeness to His poorest children, and witnessed the transformed hearts of people caught in desperate life or death situations. Their stories prove the reality of God&#x2019;s kingdom on earth, and demonstrate how to transform this world through the power of love.</p><p><b>What does it look like to trust God with EVERYTHING?</b> <p>In <i>Compelled by Love</i>, Heidi Baker gives you a glimpse of total dependence and authentic Christian community by taking a fresh look at the Beatitudes. </p><p>In the war-torn, poverty-stricken country of Mozambique, she and her husband have experienced God's miraculous provisions and witnessed the transformed hearts of people caught in desperate life-or-death situations. Join them and discover the reality of God's kingdom here on Earth. </p><p>-For anyone wondering if they could truly live a life of radical love... <br>-For anyone wondering if the Beatitudes mean anything... <br>-For anyone wondering how to follow Jesus all the way... </p><p>"<i>If God is not with us, we do not want to continue. If the Sermon on the Mount is simply impractical, our mission work is hopeless. We have no backup plan. We have nothing but Him</i>." <br>--Heidi Baker</p><p>Rolland and Heidi Baker, founders of Iris Ministries, served as missionaries in Indonesia and Hong Kong before following God&#x2019;s calling in 1995 to Mozambique. Having faced overwhelming need, the Baker now watch God provide miraculously for almost 2,000 children at their centers. Iris Ministries has expanded to more than 5,000 churches all over Mozambique and neighboring countries. The Bakers are the authors of Almost Enough and Expecting Miracles.</p></p><h2>The Curse of Chalion (Chalion series, 1)</h2><p><p>A man broken in body and spirit, Cazaril returns to the noble household he once served as page and is named secretary-tutor to the beautiful, strong-willed sister of the impetuous boy who is next in line to rule. It is an assignment Cazaril dreads, for it must ultimately lead him to the place he most fears: the royal court of Cardegoss, where the powerful enemies who once placed him in chains now occupy lofty positions.</p> <p>But it is more than the traitorous intrigues of villains that threaten Cazaril and the Royesse Iselle here, for a sinister curse hangs like a sword over the entire blighted House of Chalion. And only by employing the darkest, most forbidden of magics can Cazaril hope to protect his royal charge - an act that will mark him as a tool of the miraculous . . . and trap him in a lethal maze of demonic paradox.</p></p><p><i>Author's Note</i>:<br>&nbsp;<br><b>A Bujold Reading-Order Guide</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>The FantasyNovels</b><br>&nbsp;<br>My fantasy novels are not hard toorder. Easiest of all is <i>The Spirit Ring</i>, which is a stand-alone, oraquel, as some wag once dubbed books that for some obscure reason failed tospawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are the four volumes of <i>The SharingKnife--</i>in order, <i>Beguilement</i>, <i>Legacy</i>, <i>Passage</i>, and <i>Horizon--</i>whichI broke down and actually numbered, as this was one continuous tale dividedinto non-wrist-breaking chunks.<br>&nbsp;<br>What were called the Chalion booksafter the setting of its first two volumes, but which now that the geographicscope has widened I'm dubbing the World of the Five Gods, were written to bestand-alones as part of a larger whole, and can in theory be read in any order.Some readers think the world-building is easier to assimilate when the booksare read in publication order, and the second volume certainly containsspoilers for the first (but not the third.) In any case, the publication orderis:<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Curse of Chalion</i><br><i>Paladin of Souls</i><br><i>The Hallowed Hunt</i><br>"Penric's Demon"<br>"Penric and the Shaman"<br>&nbsp;<br>In terms of internal world chronology, <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i> wouldfall first, the Penric novellas perhaps a hundred and fifty years later, and <i>TheCurse of Chalion</i> and <i>Paladin of Souls</i> would follow a century or soafter that.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Other Original E-books</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>The short story collection <i>ProtoZoa</i> contains five very early tales--three (1980s) contemporary fantasy, twoscience fiction--all previously published but not in this handy format. Thenovelette "Dreamweaver's Dilemma" may be of interest to Vorkosigan completists,as it is the first story in which that proto-universe began, mentioning BetaColony but before Barrayar was even thought of.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Sidelines:Talks and Essays</i> is just what it says on the tin--a collection of threedecades of my nonfiction writings, including convention speeches, essays,travelogues, introductions, and some less formal pieces. I hope it will provean interesting companion piece to my fiction.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>TheVorkosigan Stories</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Many pixels have been expended debating the 'best' order inwhich to read what have come to be known as the Vorkosigan Books (or Saga), theVorkosiverse, the Miles books, and other names. The debate mainly revolvesaround publication order versus internal-chronological order. I favor internalchronological, with a few adjustments.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was always my intention to write each book as astand-alone, so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere. Whilestill somewhat true, as the series developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs,closely related tales that were richer for each other. I will list the sub-arcs,and then the books, and then the duplication warnings. (My publishing historyhas been complex.) And then the publication order, for those who want it.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Shards of Honor</i> and <i>Barrayar.</i> The first twobooks in the series proper, they detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith ofBeta Colony and Aral Vorkosigan of Barrayar. <i>Shards</i> was my very firstnovel ever; <i>Barrayar</i> was actually my eighth, but continues the tale thenext day after the end of <i>Shards</i>. For readers who want to be sure ofbeginning at the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with thesetwo.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> and <i>The Vor Game</i>(with, perhaps, the novella "The Mountains of Mourning" tucked in between.) <i>TheWarrior's Apprentice</i> introduces the character who became the series'linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the first book tells how he created a spacemercenary fleet by accident; the second how he fixed his mistakes from thefirst round. Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of otherthings one can best discover for oneself), <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i>makes another good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a youngmale protagonist.<br>&nbsp;<br>After that: <i>Brothers in Arms</i> should be read before <i>MirrorDance</i>, and both, ideally, before <i>Memory.</i><br>&nbsp;<br><i>Komarr</i> makes another alternate entry point for theseries, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read before<i>A Civil Campaign</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Borders of Infinity</i>, a collection of three of thefive currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventuresampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to committhemselves to length. (But it may make more sense if read after <i>TheWarrior's Apprentice</i>.) Take care not to confuse the collection-as-a-wholewith its title story, "The Borders of Infinity".<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Falling Free</i> takes place 200years earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters withthe main body of the series. Most readers recommend picking up this storylater. It should likely be read before <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>, however,which revisits the "quaddies", a bioengineered race of free-fall dwellers, inMiles's time.<br>&nbsp;<br>The novels in the internal-chronological list below appearin italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 wordsand 40,000 words) in quote marks.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Falling Free</i><br><i>Shards of Honor</i><br><i>Barrayar</i><br><i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i><br>"The Mountains of Mourning"<br>"Weatherman"<br><i>The Vor Game</i><br><i>Cetaganda</i><br><i>Ethan of Athos</i><br><i>Borders of Infinity</i><br>"Labyrinth"<br>"The Borders of Infinity" <br><i>Brothers in Arms</i><br><i>Mirror Dance</i><br><i>Memory</i><br><i>Komarr</i><br><i>A Civil Campaign</i><br>"Winterfair Gifts"<br><i>Diplomatic Immunity</i><br><i>Captain Vorpatril's Alliance</i><br><i>CryoBurn</i><br><i>Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Caveats:<br>&nbsp;<br>The novella "Weatherman" is anout-take from the beginning of the novel <i>The Vor Game</i>. If you alreadyhave <i>The Vor Game</i>, you likely don't need this.<br>&nbsp;<br>The original 'novel' <i>Borders ofInfinity</i> was a fix-up collection containing the three novellas "TheMountains of Mourning", "Labyrinth", and "The Borders of Infinity", togetherwith a frame to tie the pieces together.

In 1900, the four great geographical mysteries&#x2014;the Northwest Passage, the Northeast Passage, the South Pole, and the North Pole&#x2014;remained blank spots on the globe. Within twenty years Roald Amundsen would claim all four prizes. Renowned for his determination and technical skills, both feared and beloved by his men, Amundsen is a legend of the heroic age of exploration, which shortly thereafter would be tamed by technology, commerce, and publicity. F�ted in his lifetime as an international celebrity, pursued by women and creditors, he died in the Arctic on a rescue mission for an inept rival explorer.<br><br>Stephen R. Bown has unearthed archival material to give Amundsen's life the grim immediacy of Apsley Cherry-Garrard's <i>The Worst Journey in the World</i>, the exciting detail of <i>The Endurance</i>, and the suspense of a Jon Krakauer tale. <i>The Last Viking</i> is both a thrilling literary biography and a cracking good story.<br></p><p>Stephen R. Bown is the author of<i>Scurvy: How a Surgeon, a Mariner and A Gentleman Solved the Greatest Medical Mystery of the Age of Sail</i>, selected as one of the Globe and Mail's Top 100 books of 2004, and <i>A Most Damnable Invention: Dynamite, Nitrates and the Making of the Modern World</i>, selected for the Scientific American Book Club, the History Book Club and the Quality Paperback Book Club.

There are more than thirty million copies of her books in print. She lives in Texas.&nbsp;<b>"Chapter 1"</b><br><br><i>December 1973</i><br><br>With her scrapbook opened beside her on her canopied bed, Meredith Bancroft carefully cut out the picture from the <i>Chicago Tribune.</i> The caption read, <i>Children of Chicago socialites, dressed as elves, participate in charity Christmas pageant at Oakland Memorial Hospital,</i> then it listed their names. Beneath the caption picture of the "elves" -- five boys and five girls, including Meredith -- who were handing out presents to the children's ward. Standing off to the left, supervising the proceedings, was a handsome young man of eighteen, who the caption referred to as "Parker Reynolds III, son of Mr. and Mrs. Parker Reynolds of Kenilworth."<br><br>Impartially, Meredith compared herself to the other girls in the elf costumes, wondering, how they could manage to look leggy and curvy while she looked..."Dumpy!" she pronounced with a pained grimace."I look like a troll, not an elf!"<br><br>It did not seem at all fair that the other girls who were fourteen, just a few small weeks older than she was, should look so wonderful while she looked like a flat-chested troll with braces. Her gaze shifted to her picture and she regretted again the streak of vanity that had caused her to take off her glasses for the photograph; without them she had a tendency to squint -- just like she was doing in that awful picture."Contact lenses would definitely help," she concluded. Her gaze switched to Parker's picture, and a dreamy smile drifted across her face as she clasped the newspaper clipping to what would have been her breasts if she <i>had</i> breasts, which she didn't. Not yet. At this rate, not ever.<br><br>The door to her bedroom opened and Meredith hastily yanked the picture from her chest as the stout, sixty-year-old housekeeper came in to take her dinner tray away."You didn't eat your dessert," Mrs. Ellis chided.<br><br>"I'm fat, Mrs. Ellis," Meredith said. To prove it, she scrambled off the antique bed and marched over to the mirror above her dressing table."Look at me," she said, pointing an accusing finger at her reflection."I have no waistline!"<br><br>"You have some baby fat there, that's all."<br><br>"I don't have hips either. I look like a walking two-by-four. No wonder I have no friends -- "<br><br>Mrs. Ellis, who'd worked for the Bancrofts for less than a year, looked amazed. "You have no friends? Why not?"<br><br>Desperately in need of someone to confide in, Meredith said, "I've only pretended that everything is fine at school. The truth is, it's terrible. I'm a complete misfit. I've always been a misfit."<br><br>"Well, I never! There must be something wrong with the children in your school...."<br><br>"It isn't them, it's <i>me,</i> but I'm going to change," Meredith announced. "I've gone on a diet, and I want to do something with my hair. It's awful."<br><br>"It's <i>not</i> awful!" Mrs. Ellis argued, looking at Meredith's shoulder-length pale blond hair and then her turquoise eyes. "You have striking eyes and very nice hair. Nice and thick and -- "<br><br>"Colorless."<br><br>"Blond."<br><br>Meredith stared stubbornly at the mirror, her mind magnifying the flaws that existed. "I'm almost five feet seven inches tall. It's a lucky thing I finally stopped growing before I became a giant! But I'm not hopeless, I realized that on Saturday."<br><br>Mrs. Ellis's brows drew together in confusion. "What happened on Saturday to change your mind about yourself?"<br><br>"Nothing earth-shattering," Meredith said. <i>Something earth-shattering,</i> she thought. <i>Parker smiled at me at the Christmas pageant. He brought me a Coke without being asked. He told me to be sure and save a dance for him Saturday at the Eppingham party.</i> Seventy-five years before, Parker's family had founded the large Chicago bank where Bancroft &amp; Company's funds were deposited, and the friendship between the Bancrofts and Reynoldses had endured for generations. "Everything is going to change now, not just the way I look," Meredith continued happily as she turned away from the mirror. "I'm going to have a friend too! There's a new girl at school, and she doesn't know that no one else likes me. She's smart, like I am, and she called me tonight to ask me a homework question. She <i>called</i> me, and we talked about all sorts of things."<br><br>"I did notice you never brought friends home from school," Mrs. Ellis said, wringing her hands in nervous dismay, "but I thought it was because you lived so far away."<br><br>"No, it isn't that," Meredith said, flopping down onto the bed and staring self-consciously at her serviceable slippers that looked just like small replicas of the ones her father wore. Despite their wealth, Meredith's father had the liveliest respect for money; all of her clothing was of excellent quality and was purchased only when necessary, always with a stem eye toward durability. "I dont fit in, you see."<br><br>"When I was a girl," Mrs. Ellis said with a sudden look of comprehension, "we were always a little leery of children who got good grades."<br><br>"It's not just that," Meredith said wryly. "It's something besides the way I look and the grades I get that makes me a misfit. It's -- all this," she said, and made a sweeping gesture that encompassed the large, rather austere room with its antique furniture, a room whose character resembled all the other forty-five rooms in the Bancroft estate. "Everyone thinks I'm completely weird because Father insists that Fenwick drive me to school."<br><br>"What's wrong with that, may I ask?"<br><br>"The other children walk or ride the school bus."<br><br>"So?"<br><br>"So they do <i>not</i> arrive in a chauffeur-driven Rolls!" Almost wistfully, Meredith added, "Their fathers are plumbers and accountants. One of them works for us at the store."<br><br>Unable to argue with the logic of that, and unwilling to admit it was true, Mrs. Ellis said, "But this new girl in school -- she doesn't find it odd that Fenwick drives you?"<br><br>"No," Meredith said with a guilty chuckle that made her eyes glow with sudden liveliness behind her glasses, "because she thinks Fenwick <i>is</i> my father! I told her my father works for some rich people who own a big store."<br><br>"You didn't!"<br><br>"Yes, I did, and I -- I'm not sorry. I should have spread that around school years ago, only I didn't want to lie."<br><br>"But now you don't mind lying?" Mrs. Ellis said with a censorious look.<br><br>"It <i>isn't</i> a lie, not entirely," Meredith said in an imploring voice. "Father explained it to me a long time ago. You see, Bancroft &amp; Company is a corporation, and a corporation is actually owned by the stockholders. So you see, as president of Bancroft &amp; Company, Father is -- technically -- employed by the stockholders. Do you understand?"<br><br>"Probably not," she said flatly. "Who owns the stock?"<br><br> Meredith sent her a guilty look. "We do, mostly."<br><br>Mrs. Ellis found the whole notion of the operation of Bancroft &amp; Company, a famous downtown Chicago department store, absolutely baffling, but Meredith frequently displayed an uncanny understanding of the business. Although, Mrs. Ellis thought with helpless ire at Meredith's father, it wasn't so uncanny -- not when the man had no interest in his daughter <i>except</i> when he was lecturing her about that store. In fact, Mrs. Ellis thought Philip Bancroft was probably to blame for his daughter's inability to fit in with the other girls her age. He treated his daughter like an adult, and he insisted that she speak and act like one at all times. On the rare occasions when he entertained friends, Meredith even acted as his hostess. As a result, Meredith was very much at ease with adults and obviously at a complete loss with her peers.<br><br>"You're right about one thing though," Meredith said. "I can't go on tricking Lisa Pontini about Fenwick being my father. I just thought that if she had a chance to know me first, it might not matter when I tell her Fenwick is actually our chauffeur. The only reason she hasn't found out already is that she doesn't know anyone else in our class, and she always has to go straight home after school. She has seven brothers and sisters, and she has to help out at home."<br><br>Mrs. Ellis reached out and awkwardly patted Meredith's arm, trying to think of something encouraging to say. "Things always look brighter in the morning," she announced, resorting, as she often did, to one of the cozy clich�s she herself found so comforting. She picked up the dinner tray, then paused in the doorway, struck with another inspiring platitude. "And remember this," she instructed Meredith in the rising tones of one who is about to impart a very satisfying thought, "every <i>dog</i> has its <i>day!"</i><br><br>Meredith didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "Thank you, Mrs. Ellis," she said, "that is <i>very</i> encouraging." In mortified silence she watched the door close behind the housekeeper, then she slowly picked up the scrapbook. When the <i>Tribune</i> clipping had been safely taped to the page, she stared at it for a long moment, then reached out and lightly touched Parker's smiling mouth. The thought of actually dancing with him made her shiver with, a mixture of terror and anticipation. This was Thursday, and the Eppingham dance was the day after tomorrow. It see like years to wait.<br><br>Sighing, she flipped backward through the pages of the big scrapbook. At the front were some very old clippings, yellowed now with age, the pictures faded. The scrapbook had originally belonged to her mother, Caroline, and it contained the only tangible proof in the house that Caroline Edwards Bancroft had ever existed. Everything else connected with her had been removed at Philip Bancroft's instructions.<br><br>Caroline Edwards had been an actress -- not an especially good one, according to her reviews -- but an unquestionably glamorous one. Meredith studied the faded pictures, but she didn't read what the columnists had written because she knew every word by heart. She knew that Cary Grant had escorted her mother to the Academy Awards in 1955, and that David Niven had said she was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen, and that David Selznick had wanted her in one of his pictures. She knew that her mother had roles in three Broadway musicals and that the critics had panned her acting but praised her shapely legs. The gossip columnists had hinted at serious romances between Caroline and nearly all her leading men. There were clippings of her, draped in furs, attending a party in Rome; wrapped in a strapless black evening gown, playing roulette in Monte Carlo. In one photograph she was clad in a skimpy bikini on the beach in Monaco, in another, siding in Gstaad with a Swiss Olympic Gold Medalist. It was obvious to Meredith that wherever she went, Caroline had been surrounded by handsome men.<br><br>The last clipping her mother had saved was dated six months after the one in Gstaad. She was wearing a magnificent white wedding gown -- laughing and running down the cathedral steps on Philip Bancrofts arm beneath a shower of rice. The society columnists had outdone themselves with extravagant descriptions of the wedding. The reception at the Palmer House Hotel had been dosed to the press, but the columnists faithfully reported all the famous guests who were present, from the Vanderbilts and Whitneys, to a Supreme Court justice and four U.S. senators.<br><br>The marriage lasted two years -- long enough for Caroline to get pregnant, have her baby, have a sleazy affair with a horse trainer, and then go running off to Europe with a phony Italian prince who'd been a guest in this very house Beyond that, Meredith knew little, except that her mother had never bothered to send her so much as a note or a birthday card. Meredith's father, who placed great emphasis on dignity and old-fashioned values, said her mother was a self-centered slut without the slightest conception of marital fidelity or maternal responsibility. When Meredith was a year old, he had filed for divorce and for custody of Meredith, fully prepared to exert all the Bancroft family's considerable political and social influence to assure that he won his suit. In the end he hadn't needed to resort to that. According to what he'd told Meredith, her mother hadn't bothered to wait around for the court hearing, let alone try to oppose him.<br><br>Once he was granted custody of Meredith, her father had set out to ensure that she would never follow her mother's example. Instead, he was determined that Meredith would take her place in a long line of dignified Bancroft women who'd led exemplary lives dedicated to charitable good works that befitted their station, and to which not a single breath of scandal had ever been attached.<br><br>When it came time for her to start school, Philip had discovered to his annoyance that standards of conduct were relaxing, even among his own social class. Many of his acquaintances were taking a more liberal view of child behavior and sending their children to "progressive" schools like Bently and Ridgeview. When he inspected these schools, he heard phrases like "unstructured classes" and "self-expression." Progressive education sounded undisciplined to him; it foretold lower standards of education and deportment. After rejecting both those schools, he took Meredith with him to see St. Stephen's -- a private Catholic school ran by the Benedictine nuns, the same school his aunt and his mother had attended.<br><br>Her father had approved of all he saw the day they visited St. Stephen's: Thirty-four first-grade girls in demure gray-and-blue-plaid jumpers, and ten boys in white shirts and blue ties, had come instantly and respectfully to their feet when the nun had shown him the classroom. Forty-four young voices had chorused, <i>"Good morning, Sister."</i> Furthermore, St. Stephen's still taught academics in the good old-fashioned way -- unlike Bently, where he'd seen some children finger-painting while the other students, who <i>chose</i> to learn, worked on math. As an added benefit, Meredith would receive strict moral training here as well.<br><br>Her father was not oblivious to the fact that the neighborhood surrounding St. Stephen's had deteriorated, but he was obsessed with the idea that Meredith be raised in the same manner as the other upstanding, upright Bancroft women who had attended St. Stephen's for three generations. He solved the matter of the neighborhood by having the family chauffeur drive Meredith to and from school.<br><br>The one thing he didn't realize was that the girls and boys who attended St. Stephen's were not the virtuous little beings they'd seemed to be that day. They were ordinary kids from lower-middle-class families and even some poor families; they played together and walked to school together, and they shared a common suspicion of anyone from an entirely different and far more prosperous background.<br><br>Meredith hadn't known about that when she arrived at St. Stephen's to start first grade. Clad in her neat gray-and-blue-plaid uniform jumper and carrying her new lunch pail, she'd quaked with the nervous excitement of any six-year-old confronting a class filled with strangers, but she'd felt little actual fear. After spending her whole life in relative loneliness, with only her father and the servants as companions, she was happily anticipating the prospect of...</p><h2>Mr. Putter &amp; Tabby Stir the Soup</h2><p>Mr. Putter and Tabby love homemade soup.

The vastly popular Web site, now a book, recognizes "individuals who ensure the long-term survival of our species by removing themselves from the gene pool in a sublimely idiotic fashion." Who wins a Darwin Award? Terrorists who set their bombs on daylight saving time and delivered them on standard time, blowing themselves up. Folks who put garlands around a Bengal tiger's neck. Guys in Cambodia who took turns stomping on a land mine they'd brought into a bar. The six Egyptians who drowned trying to rescue a chicken that fell into a well. (The chicken alone survived.) The Buenos Aires husband who threw his wife out an eighth-floor window during a spat, noticed she'd gotten caught in power lines, and jumped after her, "angrily trying to finish the job, or remorsefully hoping to rescue her." He went splat; she escaped unscathed. There are some urban legends, like the sergeant said to have attached a Jet-Assisted Take-Off unit to his Chevy and hit a cliff 125 feet up (not true, says author Wendy Northcutt), and all-too-true honorable mentions, like the man who put weather balloons on his lawn chair, soared to 16,000 feet, crashed into power lines, blacked out Long Beach, California, and told police, "A man can't just sit around." My favorite winner: the man who was bitten nine times by the same king brown snake because he put it in a bag on his car seat and kept sticking his hand back into the bag. Why did he pick up the snake with his left hand? "Because I was holding a beer in my right one." And where did this take place? In Darwin, Australia.

Cheating. Manipulating. <br> <br> Will they ever change?<br> <br> What will it take to get through to them?<br> <br> They apologized, but will this time be different...or will they just get better at hiding what they are up to?<br> <br> This book will help you get out of the fog of confusion and into the clarity you are looking for.<br> <br> FOG is an acronym that stands for "Fear, Obligation, and Guilt." These three emotions are often at the core of manipulation, and are often how narcissists, sociopaths, and other types of emotional manipulators go about controlling their targets. <br> <br> However, this type of destructive manipulation isn't just limited to narcissists and sociopaths. <br> <br> There is no shortage of people with well-intended bad advice out there who unintentionally fall into the FOG as well, and push targets of abuse into keeping the relationship going. <br> <br> The FOG is one of the main reasons that people stay "stuck" in abusive relationships for so long, why they continue to get involved with abusive people, why they feel that they are the problem, and why they tend to feel that the abuse is somehow their fault. <br> <br> When a person is being manipulated they have a hard time figuring out who has the problem, what is normal, what is problematic, and if their wants, needs, and feelings are valid. The disasterous effects of being lost in the FOG are confusion, crazymaking, people pleasing, and an erosion of boundaries.<br> <br> What makes this well-intended bad advice so damaging is that, on the surface, it seems like good advice--especially if it's coming from people who seem to have our best interests in mind, such as friends, family, church members, support group members, or a therapist. <br> <br> Some examples of this well-intended bad advice that comes from other people is: <br> <br> "Who are you to judge?"<br> "No one is perfect."<br> "You need to forgive them."<br> "She's your mother, you need to have a relationship with her...she's not getting any younger you know."<br> "Commitment is forever."<br> <br> What can be so crazymaking for targets is that they are often getting two very different messages. On one hand, they are told that they need to work towards a solution, and on the other, they are told that need to leave a partner who lies, cheats, steals, hits, yells, or belittles them. <br> <br> This book compares and contrasts of these concepts so that targets of any type of manipulation and abuse can make a more empowered decision.<br> <br> Some of the concepts covered are: <br> <br> Who are You to Judge vs. Being Discerning<br> No One is Perfect vs. Tolerating Abuse<br> You Need to Forgive Them vs. Keeping Yourself Safe<br> A Parent vs. A Predator<br> Commitment vs. Codependency<br> Self-love vs. Selfishness<br> A Person Acting the Part vs. A Person Actually Changing<br> Gut Instincts vs. Hypervigilance<br> A Friend vs. Someone Being Friendly<br> Caring vs. Caretaking<br> Being in Love With Them vs. Being in Love With Who They Pretended to Be<br> Workable Behavior vs. Deal Breakers<br> Acceptance vs. Allowance<br> Going Through So Much Together vs. Being Put Through So Much By Them<br> Sincerity vs. Intensity<br> Healthy Bonding vs. Trauma Bonding<br> Insincere Remorse vs. Sincere Remorse<br> Reacting vs. Responding<br> <br> ...and many more. </p></p><p><p>I wish I had this information 47 years ago! - A.

In <i>Merrick</i>, Anne Rice brings back three of her most wildly popular characters--the vampires Lestat and Louis and the dead vampire child Claudia--and introduces them to the world of her Mayfair Witches book series. <p> It is Louis who brings about the collision of the fang and voodoo universes. Louis made Claudia a vampire in Rice's classic <i>Interview with the Vampire</i>, in which she was destroyed, and now he's obsessed with raising her ghost to make amends and seek guidance from the beyond. (Claudia physically resembles Rice's young daughter who died of a blood-related illness. Rice nearly died of a diabetic coma in 1998, and writing <i>Merrick</i> turned her excruciating recovery into an exhilarating burst of creativity).</p><p> Vampire David Talbot lobbies Merrick to call Claudia's spirit and slake Louis's guilt, but Talbot winds up in the grip of an obsession with the witch. You see, Talbot, unlike most vampires, lived 70 years as a human, so his sexual response to humans is still as strong as his blood thirst. Merrick can cast spells to make men crave her, and Talbot is tormented. After she reads his palm, he muses, "I wanted to take her in my arms, not to feed from her, no, not harm her, only kiss her, only sink my fangs a very little, only taste her blood and her secrets, but this was dreadful and I wouldn't let it go on."</p><p> The secrets of <i>Merrick</i> are dark and sensuous, but the book is a romp animated by Rice's feeling of coming back to life through the magic of a literary outpouring. The narrative flashes back to the past, to an Indiana Jones-ish adventure in a Guatemalan cave, and to scenes from many other Rice novels. It may be helpful to read <i>Merrick</i> with the Rice-approved guidebooks <i>The Vampire Companion</i> and <i>The Witches' Companion</i> at hand.</p><p> After many books, Rice's grand Vampire Chronicles tale was in peril of getting long in the tooth. Merrick Mayfair's magic represents an infusion of fresh blood. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The A Game: Nine Steps To Better Grades</h2><p>The A Game: Nine Steps to Better Grades is a must-read for all college freshmen.

But here's a better idea. Skip the years of study and jump right to the speaking part. Sound crazy? No, it's language hacking. <br><br>Unlike most traditional language courses that try to teach you the rules of Spanish, #LanguageHacking shows you how to learn and speak Spanish through proven memory techniques, unconventional shortcuts and conversation strategies perfected by one of the world's greatest language learners, Benny Lewis, aka the Irish Polyglot. <br><br>Using the language hacks -shortcuts that make learning simple - that Benny mastered while learning his 11 languages and his 'speak from the start' method, you will crack the language code and exponentially increase your language abilities so that you can get fluent faster. <br><br>It's not magic. It's not a language gene. It's not something only "other people" can do. It's about being smart with how you learn, learning what's indispensable, skipping what's not, and using what you've learned to have real conversations in Spanish from day one.<br><br>The Method<br><br>#LanguageHacking takes a modern approach to language learning, blending the power of online social collaboration with traditional methods. It focuses on the conversations that learners need to master right away, rather than presenting language in order of difficulty like most courses. This means that you can have conversations immediately, not after years of study.<br><br>Each of the 10 units culminates with a speaking 'mission' that prepares you to use the language you've learned to talk about yourself. Through the language hacker online learner community, you can share your personalized speaking 'missions' with other learners - getting and giving feedback and extending your learning beyond the pages of the book . You don't need to go abroad to learn a language any more.</p><p>Irish native Benny Lewis speaks over ten languages - all self-taught. In 2003, he spoke only one language: English. After university, he moved to Spain and was soon frustrated that he could not speak Spanish after six months of studying. So he decided to abandon traditional learning approaches and just start speaking - and everything changed. Today Benny is known as The Irish Polyglot and speaks Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Hungarian. He is the author of the bestselling book on language learning, <i>Fluent in 3 months</i>. He also runs the largest language learning blog in the world, www.fluentin3months.com, where he breaks down the language learning process for busy people. Lewis is a full-time 'language hacker', and devotes his time to finding better, faster, and more efficient ways to learn languages.

He hadn&#x2019;t felt natural light on his face in months. The rosy glow spilled over the horizon and seeped into the icy blue of the tundra, casting indigo shadows across the snow. The dawn climbed like a wall of hungry fire, delicate pink deepening to orange, then crimson, consuming the thick layers of cloud one at a time until the entire sky was burning. He basked in its muted glow, his skin tingling.<br> The overcast sky was unusual for the spring season. The observatory&#x2019;s site had been chosen for its clear weather, the thin polar atmosphere, and the elevation of the Cordillera Mountains. Augie left the concrete steps of the observatory and followed the path carved into the steep slope of the mountain&#x2014;-down to the cluster of outbuildings nestled against the mountain&#x2019;s incline, then beyond them. By the time he&#x2019;d passed the last outbuilding the sun had already begun to sink, the color to fade. The day had come and gone in ten minutes&#x2014;-less, perhaps. Snow--covered peaks rolled all the way to the northern horizon. To the south, the low, smooth expanse of the tundra flowed into the distance. On his best days the blank canvas of the landscape set him at ease; on his worst he contemplated madness. The land did not care for him and there was nowhere else to go. He wasn&#x2019;t sure yet which sort of day today was.<br> In a different life he used to pack his soft leather suitcase whenever his environment rejected him, as it often did, and find another place to go. It wasn&#x2019;t even a very large suitcase, but it contained the essentials of his existence neatly, with a little room to spare. There was never a need for moving trucks, or bubble wrap, or farewell parties. When he decided to go, he was gone within the week. From a postgraduate fellowship in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile where he cut his teeth on dying stars, to South Africa, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, New Mexico, Australia&#x2014;-following the most advanced telescopes, the biggest satellite arrays, like bread crumbs scattered across the globe. The less earthly interference there was, the better. It had always been this way for Augustine.<br> Continents and countries meant nothing to him; it was only the sky that moved him, the happenings on the other side of the atmospheric window. His work ethic was strong, his ego engorged, his results groundbreaking, but he wasn&#x2019;t satisfied. He had never been satisfied and never would be. It wasn&#x2019;t success he craved, or even fame, it was history: he wanted to crack the universe open like a ripe watermelon, to arrange the mess of pulpy seeds before his dumbfounded colleagues. He wanted to take the dripping red fruit in his hands and quantify the guts of infinity, to look back into the dawn of time and glimpse the very beginning. He wanted to be remembered.<br> Yet here he was, seventy--eight years old, at the top of the Arctic archipelago, on the rind of civilization&#x2014;and, having come to the terminus of his life&#x2019;s work, all he could do was stare into the bleak face of his own ignorance.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Barbeau Observatory was built as an extension of the mountain. The blunt fist of the telescope&#x2019;s dome rose defiantly higher than anything else for miles, surveying the rest of the mountain range like a warden. There was an airstrip and a hangar about a kilometer south, where the tundra had been packed and smoothed by a bulldozer airlifted from Greenland, marked with reflective orange flags and lined with lights that didn&#x2019;t work anymore. The hangar was empty, the strip neglected. The last planes to use them had come to collect the researchers from the outpost, and the last news from civilization, over a year ago, had been of war.<br> The outpost was stocked to last a dozen researchers for nine months: barrels of fuel, nonperishable food, purified water, medical supplies, guns and fishing gear, cross--country skis and crampons and climbing ropes. There was more research equipment than Augie could use, more incoming data than he could process in a dozen lifetimes. He was more or less content with the way things were. The observatory was the focal point of the outpost, in the center of the scattered dorms, storage units, and rec buildings. Its structure was the most permanent thing about the base&#x2014;-after all, the massive telescope it housed was the reason everything else was there. The outbuildings that surrounded the observatory were hardly buildings at all, more like weatherproof tents for eating, drinking, sleeping, and storage. Barbeau&#x2019;s standard research fellowship lasted between six and nine months, but Augustine had stayed for almost two years before the evacuation. Now it was nearly three years that he&#x2019;d been here. The program drew a collection of young, bold men, often fresh out of their PhD programs, impatient to shrug off the close quarters of academia, at least for a while, before they let it encircle them for good. Augustine had despised these bookbound researchers, all theory and little or no practical skill. Then again, he would have been hard-pressed to name someone he didn&#x2019;t despise.<br> Squinting at the horizon, he could just make out the sinking orb of the sun through the thick cloud cover, sliced in half by the jagged outline of the Cordillera Mountains. It was a little past noon, in late March. Polar night had finally passed over this desolate patch of earth, and now the day would gradually return. It would begin slowly, a few hours of light at a time, peeking over the skyline. But soon enough the midnight sun would rise and the stars would fade. By the end of summer&#x2019;s brightness he would welcome the twilit days of autumn, then the blue--black of winter, but for now he couldn&#x2019;t imagine a more comforting view than the melted outline of the sun, roosting close to the horizon, its light spilling down onto the low--lying tundra.<br> In Michigan, where Augustine had grown up, winter came softly: the powder of the first snow, the pillowy drifts, icicles that grew long and sharp, then began to <i>drip drip pour</i> into a gush of spring. Here, everything was hard. Bleak. As unforgiving as the edge of a diamond, with great shelves of ice that never melted and the ground that never thawed. As the remaining light faded from the noon sky, he watched a polar bear lope across one of the mountain ridges, heading toward the sea to hunt. Augie wished he could climb into its thick skin and sew it shut behind him. He imagined what it would feel like: looking down a long snout at paws the size of serving platters, rolling onto his back and feeling a thousand pounds of muscle and fat and fur press into the frozen ground. Pulling a ringed seal from its breathing hole and killing it with one powerful swipe, burying his teeth in its flesh, ripping away steaming chunks of blubber and then falling asleep in a clean, white snowdrift: sated. No thoughts&#x2014;-just instincts. Just hunger and sleepiness. And desire, if it was the right time of year, but never love, never guilt, never hope. An animal built for survival, not reflection. The idea almost made him smile, but Augustine was not in the habit of bending his mouth in that direction.<br> He didn&#x2019;t understand love any better than the bear did. He never had. In the past, he&#x2019;d felt the nibble of a lesser emotion&#x2014;-shame or regret or resentment or envy&#x2014;-but whenever that happened, he would turn his gaze to the sky and let awe wash it away. Only the cosmos inspired great feeling in him. Perhaps what he felt was love, but he&#x2019;d never consciously named it. His was an all--consuming one--directional romance with the emptiness and the fullness of the entire universe. There was no room to spare, no time to waste on a lesser lover. He preferred it that way.<br> The closest he&#x2019;d ever come to letting his adoration rest on human shoulders was a long time ago. He was in his thirties when he impregnated a beautiful woman with a razor--sharp mind at the research facility in Socorro, New Mexico. She was another scientist, a PhD candidate finishing her dissertation, and the first time he met her, Augustine thought she was extraordinary. He&#x2019;d felt a warm spark for the idea of their baby when she told him the news, like the flicker of a newborn star six billion light-years away. Tangible, beautiful, but already dying by the time it reached him, an afterglow. It wasn&#x2019;t enough. He tried to persuade the woman to have an abortion, and he left the hemisphere when she refused. He kept to the other side of the equator for years, unable to bear the proximity of a child he didn&#x2019;t have the capacity to love. Time passed, and he eventually troubled himself to learn the child&#x2019;s name, her birthday. He sent an expensive amateur telescope when she turned five, a celestial sphere when she turned six, a signed first edition of <i>Cosmos</i> by Carl Sagan when she turned seven. He forgot her birthday the next year, but sent more books, advanced tomes on practical astronomy, for her ninth and tenth. Then he lost track of her&#x2014;-of them both. The chunk of moon rock intended for her next birthday, which he&#x2019;d finagled from the geology department at one of his many research posts, was returned to him labeled <i>Invalid Address.</i> He shrugged it off and decided not to go looking again. This game with the gifts had been unwise, a sentimental stutter in an otherwise logical life. After that, he thought of the extraordinary woman and her child rarely, and eventually he forgot them altogether.<br> The polar bear ambled down the other side of the mountain and was lost to view, swallowed by the snow. Augie slouched deeper into the hood of his parka, cinching the drawstrings tighter around his neck. A frigid wind blasted through him. He closed his eyes, felt the crisp frost in his nostrils, the numb shuffle of his toes deep inside wool socks and heavy boots. His hair and beard had turned white thirty years ago, but a sprinkling of black hairs across his chin and neck persisted, as if he&#x2019;d left the job of aging half--finished and moved on to another project. He had been old for years now, closer to death than to birth, unable to walk as far or stand as long as he used to, but that winter in particular he&#x2019;d begun to feel very old. Ancient. As though he was beginning to shrink, his spine slowly curling in on itself, his bones huddling closer together. He began to lose track of time, which wasn&#x2019;t unusual in the endless dark of winter, but also of his own thoughts. He would come to, as though from a dream, uncertain what he&#x2019;d been thinking a moment ago, where he&#x2019;d been walking, what he&#x2019;d been doing. He tried to imagine what would become of Iris when he was gone. Then he stopped himself. Instead, he tried not to care.<br> &nbsp;<br> When he returned to the control tower the color in the sky had faded to a deep twilit blue. He shouldered open the heavy steel door with enormous effort. It was more difficult than it had been last year. With each season that passed, his body seemed more breakable. The wind slammed the door behind him. To save fuel he heated only the top floor of the observatory: one long room, where he kept all of his most prized instruments, and where he and Iris slept. A few comforts from the lower floors and the outbuildings had been relocated there: two induction hot plates, a nest made of sleeping bags and lumpy single mattresses, a scant assortment of dishes and pans and cutlery, an electric kettle. Augie had to rest on each step as he climbed. When he reached the third floor, he shut the stairwell door behind him to keep in the warmth. He shed his winter layers slowly, hanging every piece from a long row of hooks on the wall. Too many hooks for one man. He gave each mitten its own peg, unwrapped his scarf and hung that too, spreading his clothes along the coat rack. Perhaps this was to make the room seem less empty&#x2014;-filling the space around him with traces of himself so that the howling loneliness wasn&#x2019;t quite so obvious. A few flannels hung at the other end, a pair of long johns, some thick sweaters. He struggled with the toggles on his parka, then with the zipper. Hung that up too.<br> Iris was nowhere in sight. She spoke rarely, though she hummed quietly on occasion, melodies of her own composition that seemed to rise and fall with the sound of the wind against the dome above them: the environmental orchestra. He paused and listened for her, but there was nothing. More often than not, Augustine didn&#x2019;t see her because she wasn&#x2019;t moving, and so he scanned the room carefully, watching for the subtle blink of an eye, listening for the slight sound of her breath. It was just the two of them at the observatory, and the telescope, and the tundra. The last of the civilian researchers had been flown back to the nearest military base almost a year ago, and from there had returned to wherever they belonged so that they might rejoin their families. Something catastrophic was happening in the outside world, but that was all anyone would say. The other researchers didn&#x2019;t question their rescuers&#x2014;-they packed in a hurry and did what the evac team told them to do, but Augustine didn&#x2019;t want to leave.<br> The Air Force unit that had arrived to transport the scientists home gathered everyone in the director&#x2019;s office before they started packing up the base. The captain read out the names of all the researchers and gave them instructions on when and how to board the Herc waiting on the runway.<br> &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be going,&#x201d; Augustine said when his name was called. One of the military personnel laughed. There were a few sighs from the scientists. No one took him seriously at first. But Augustine had no intention of budging.

The criminal courts are the crucial gateway between police action on the street and the processing of primarily black and Latino defendants into jails and prisons. And yet the courts, often portrayed as sacred, impartial institutions, have remained shrouded in secrecy, with the majority of Americans kept in the dark about how they function internally. <i>Crook County</i> bursts open the courthouse doors and enters the hallways, courtrooms, judges' chambers, and attorneys' offices to reveal a world of punishment determined by race, not offense.</p> <p>Nicole Gonzalez Van Cleve spent ten years working in and investigating the largest criminal courthouse in the country, Chicago&#x2013;Cook County, and based on over 1,000 hours of observation, she takes readers inside our so-called halls of justice to witness the types of everyday racial abuses that fester within the courts, often in plain sight. We watch white courtroom professionals classify and deliberate on the fates of mostly black and Latino defendants while racial abuse and due process violations are encouraged and even seen as justified. Judges fall asleep on the bench. Prosecutors hang out like frat boys in the judges' chambers while the fates of defendants hang in the balance. Public defenders make choices about which defendants they will try to "save" and which they will sacrifice. Sheriff's officers cruelly mock and abuse defendants' family members. </p> <p><i>Crook County</i>'s powerful and at times devastating narratives reveal startling truths about a legal culture steeped in racial abuse. Defendants find themselves thrust into a pernicious legal world where courtroom actors live and breathe racism while simultaneously committing themselves to a colorblind ideal. Gonzalez Van Cleve urges all citizens to take a closer look at the way we do justice in America and to hold our arbiters of justice accountable to the highest standards of equality.</p> <p>Delve deeper into <i>Crook County</i> with related media and instructor resources.</p></p><p><b>Nicole Gonzalez Van Cleve</b> is an Assistant Professor at Temple University in the Department of Criminal Justice, with courtesy appointments in the Department of Sociology and the Beasley School of Law.

She has provided legal commentary on the criminal justice system for MSNBC's <i>The Rachel Maddow Show</i>, <i>NBC News</i>, <i>CNN</i>, and <i>The New York Times</i>.Urgent and important, <i>Crook County</i> is a powerful, eye-opening account of the code of the big-city court system. Carefully dissecting this crucial step of the 'school to prison pipeline,' Nicole Gonzalez Van Cleve illustrates just how the scales of justice are cynically stacked against black and brown inner city young people, undermining their faith in our criminal justice system. <i>Crook County</i> is a must-read." (Elijah Anderson <i>Yale University, author of <i>Code of the Street</i> and <i>The Cosmopolitan Canopy</i></i>)<br><br>"In a groundbreaking new book, <i>Crook County: Racism and Injustice in America's Largest Criminal Court</i>, Professor Nicole Gonzalez Van Cleve adds an important, novel dimension to this problem. She exposes the deeply flawed operation of the criminal justice system by focusing on how felonies are processed in Cook County, Illinois...Van Cleve's important ethnography brings to light the hidden and pernicious workings of the criminal justice system that often operates in the shadows." (L. Song Richardson <i><i>Yale Law Journal</i></i>)<br><br>"Van Cleve's book is nothing less than a tour de force, and a clarion call for bringing egalitarian principles of racial and social justice to our most overlooked of criminal justice institutions, the courts. It forces us to confront 'the everyday miscarriages of justice' that pervade today's courts, asking us what has become of Gideon's trumpet in the age of spatially and racially concentrated 'mass incarceration.' The book is destined to become a classic, and ought to be on the mandatory reading list for citizens, law and society scholars and all sentient social scientists." (Thomas E. Reifer <i><i>Law and Society Review</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>Crook County</i> is a searing account of how criminal courts serve as the gateway to racialized punishment. Turning a spotlight on the everyday actions of prosecutors, judges, and defense attorneys, Gonzalez Van Cleve reveals a court culture that dehumanizes and discriminates against defendants, victims, and family members. Her eye-opening analysis forces us to confront the possibility [or reality] that mass incarceration results from mass wrongful convictions of black and brown people forced into a devastating charade." (Dorothy Roberts <i>University of Pennsylvania, author of <i>Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty</i></i>)<br><br>"Through her meticulous methodological approach that draws on field notes, over one thousand hours of court observations by court watchers, and interviews with judges, private attorneys, public defenders, and prosecutors, Van Cleve outlines a legal habitus allowing individual actors to appear blameless in the practice of racialized justice....Reading <i>Crook County</i>, it becomes clear that the court system is a mere charade of what it is meant to be."&#x2013;&#x2013;Amy Baumann Grau, <i>Contexts</i><br><br>"This book is public sociology at its best. It is theoretically grounded, methodologically rigorous and innovativeIn sharp detail, the book shows how the crisis of racism is routinized in the daily functions of formal institutions of justice.

It transcends geographic boundaries and at once provides seminal insights into future ethnographic research Gonzalez Van Cleve demonstrates the power of ethnography in the best possible sense." (Benjamin Fleury-Steiner <i><i>British Journal of Criminology</i></i>)<br><br>"Beautifully written and keenly insightful, <i>Crook County</i> is a horror story I couldn't put down.

Finally, their voyage had ended. As the passengers gathered on deck, Sadie recalled, they marveled at a giant green figure that seemed to rise out of the water. She never forgot "the big woman with the spikes on her head and the lamp that is lighted at night in her hand." Thus, the Statue of Liberty welcomed the newcomers to the United States and, they prayed, to a better life.<br><br> Although America has always been a land of hope, immigrants have come from different places, at different times, for different reasons. This has led historians to divide immigration into two phases: old and new. The old immigration began in colonial times, more than a century before the United States existed as an independent nation. Over the generations, immigrants came from western and northern Europe: England, Scotland, Ireland, Holland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark. Except for Irish Catholics, most "old" immigrants were of the Protestant faith and could read and write their native language. Despite hardships, these people soon found their place in America.<br><br> The shift from the old to the new immigration began in the 1880s. While immigrants continued to arrive from the familiar places, a flood of humanity also came from southern and eastern Europe: Italy, Greece, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Russia. By 1910, people from these countries made up seven out of ten immigrants entering the United States, chiefly through New York City. Of these, the vast majority were Italians (mainly Catholic) and Jews from Russia. Because nearly all the victims of the Triangle Fire were from these two groups, we must look at them closely.<br> The Land Time Forgot<br><br> Educated Americans had always admired Italy as a land of beauty and culture. Each year, thousands of tourists visited its ancient cities--Rome, Florence, Milan, Venice--to see their splendid churches, museums, and art galleries. Music lovers filled the opera houses and concert halls. Yet few Americans realized that Italy was really two countries.<br><br> Northern Italy, the area tourists favored, was more advanced economically than the southern areas. The nation's industries, banks, and major businesses were based in the north. Since the government was in Rome, the capital, Northerners made the laws, controlled the courts, and commanded the police. For them, the south was little more than an uncivilized colony, an extension of Africa.<br><br> If you look at a map, you will see that southern Italy forms the heel and toe of the Italian "boot." The boot, in turn, "kicks" Sicily, an Italian island in the Mediterranean Sea. Known as "the land time forgot," the south was a region of small farms and villages that lagged behind the industrial north in all things but la miseria--misery.<br><br> Misery ruled southern Italy. The majority of its people were among the poorest in Europe. Peasants, or farmers, did not own the land, but worked tiny parcels rented from wealthy landlords, chiefly nobles and northern businessmen. Landlords demanded high rents, so peasants could not afford to buy fertilizer or machinery. Instead, they tilled the soil with hand plows and hoes that were old when their grandparents were children. Peasant families were large and worked together, including children, who were given small chores nearly from the moment they could walk. Youngsters attended school briefly if at all, for they had to help in the fields. Large families lived in tiny, cramped cottages, merely shacks with earthen floors and shared with a prized goat or rooster.<br><br> Northerners had little respect for southerners, nicknamed "Black Italians" in a racist epithet meant to show their "inferiority"; they called Sicilians "Africans." The government in Rome cheated the south in countless ways. It built no modern roads or bridges there. Instead, it acted like a gigantic straw, sucking out whatever money it could. Heavy taxes collected in the south were spent in the north. Worse, justice was a cruel farce. If wronged by a landlord, a peasant was out of luck. Courts and police served the landlord. This, in turn, made peasants cynical, convinced others acted only for selfish reasons. Proverbs expressed their outrage: "The gallows is for the poor man, the law courts for the fool," "The law works against people," "The fat pig pays no taxes." If one person killed another, the victim's family took justice into its own hands, vowing to "wash blood with blood."<br><br> Mother Nature herself seemed to turn against the land time forgot. Massive cutting down of forests for firewood and building materials harmed the environment. Without tree roots to hold the soil in place, rain washed away fertile soil, causing crop failures and hunger. Elsewhere, swamps formed. Mosquitos breed in swamps. If a certain species of mosquito bites a person, it may inject a microscopic organism that causes malaria. This disease has killed more people than all history's wars, famines, and natural disasters combined. By the 1880s, malaria had become epidemic in southern Italy.<br><br> Disasters burst from within the earth, too. In 1905, earthquakes shook the region, collapsing buildings and burying their inhabitants under the rubble. The next year, Mount Vesuvius erupted. Located just east of Naples, this volcano had a fearsome history. An eruption in the year AD 79 buried the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, killing all their inhabitants. The 1906 eruption sent "explosions of red-hot stones" a half mile into the air. "The end of the world has come!" people cried in panic. "The inhabitants of the villages in the vicinity of Mount Vesuvius are in a condition of terror," said the New York Times. <br></p><h2>I Am Loved</h2><p>Newbery Award honoree Ashley Bryan has hand-selected a dozen of National Book Award winner Nikki Giovanni&#x2019;s poems to illustrate with his inimitable flourish.<br><br>There is nothing more important to a child than to feel loved, and this gorgeous gathering of poems written by Nikki Giovanni celebrates exactly that. Hand-selected by Newbery honoree Ashley Bryan, he has, with his masterful flourish of color, shape, and movement, added a visual layering that drums the most impartant message of all to young, old, parent, child, grandparent, and friend alike: You are loved. You are loved. You are loved.

He lives in Islesford, one of the Cranberry Isles off the coast of Maine.In this collection, poet Giovanni seeks to remind black children especially that they are loved. Giovanni carries the weight of the love that has sustained generations and united communities to her poems with amazing, succinct elegance. Standouts include "I Am a Mirror," opposite which Bryan centers a real inset mirror against a colorful background of vibrant shapes amid natural landscapes. "I reflect the strengths / Of my people / And for that alone / I am loved," concludes Giovanni's ode to black ancestry and intergenerational resilience. "No Heaven" takes another heartwarming approach sure to incite genuine embraces among readers. "How can there be / No Heaven / When tears comfort / When dreams caress / When you smile / at me." Recalling her earlier collection Hip Hop Speaks to Children (2008, illustrated by Kristen Balouch), Giovanni ends with the playful and reflective "Do the Rosa Parks," a rhythmic and moving song about the power of sitting down to stand up. Outkast vibes run through it, though some readers may wish for an instructional cue. Throughout, Bryan's bright tempera and watercolor paintings offer readers harmonious forms and flowing lines, smiling black children and adults arranged as if in tropically colored stained-glass windows. The two masters together deliver another powerful addition to their separate, award-winning catalogs. A small but mighty collection sure to remind readers that love, again, can prevail over all if given the chance.&nbsp; Author: Kirkus Reviews Source: October 15, 2017<br><br>Iconic, award-winning American poet Giovanni has long crafted verses that have been considered radical, sensual, and even revolutionary in their depiction of the power of love. This picture-book poetry collection for children contains a selection of her work that celebrates all manner of love, and it is beautifully illustrated by the equally renown Bryan. The book begins with an address to children, stating simply and elegantly that their existence is reason enough for poetry and songs to be written: &#x201c;as time goes on / I am you / and you are me / and that&#x2019;s how life / goes on.&#x201d; In a world that often seems not to value brownskinned children, this message is acutely timely and further reflected in Bryan&#x2019;s artwork. Other poems describe friendships between peers, the loss of loved ones, possessive love, and ancestral love across time. They vary in tone from gentle (&#x201c;Leaves,&#x201d; &#x201c;Wild Flowers&#x201d;) to jaunty (&#x201c;Three/Quarters Time,&#x201d; &#x201c;Paula the Cat&#x201d;). Bryan&#x2019;s stylized tempera-paint-and-watercolor illustrations are full of whimsy and smiling faces, providing the perfect complement to Giovanni&#x2019;s work. &#x2014; Amina Chaudhri Author: Booklist Source: Nov 1, 2017<br><br>In 11 poems, a mix of new and previously published work, Giovanni celebrates open-ended and affirming love. Some invoke love directly (&#x201c;I wrote a poem/ for you because/ you are/ my little boy,&#x201d; begins the opening poem, &#x201c;Because&#x201d;), others obliquely: in &#x201c;Quilts,&#x201d; an old tablecloth seeks new life: &#x201c;When I am frayed and stained and drizzled at the end/ Please someone cut a square and put me in a quilt/ That I might keep some child warm.&#x201d; Newbery Honor&#x2013;winner Bryan paints African-American men, women, and children in thick, swirling compositions suggestive of stained glass; he makes room for an embedded mirror to accompany a poem that addresses readers directly: &#x201c;I reflect the strengths/ Of my people/ And for that alone/ I am loved.&#x201d; A joyful and broad reflection of love&#x2019;s many faces. Author: Publishers Weekly Source: November 6, 2017<br><br>A legendary pair presents a volume of verse worth remembering. Bryan&#x2019;s recognizably vibrant, colorful, and moving illustrations accompany a selection of Giovanni&#x2019;s poems (both new and previously published). The electric blue, sunny yellow, warm brown, bright purple, etc., of the front-cover illustration set the upbeat tone that Bryan maintains throughout (even in &#x201c;A Song of a Blackbird,&#x201d; a poem about death). While the topics range from dance to self-reflection to nature to friendship, each illustration affirms the beauty and worth of black and brown children. Several poems recall slavery and the civil rights movement, providing a historical source of strength and courage for contemporary readers. One poem, &#x201c;I Am a Mirror,&#x201d; is told from the first-person perspective of the mylar mirror attached to the facing page. The speaker travels back generationally, beginning with &#x201c;I reflect the grace / Of my mother...&#x201d; and going back to the great-grandfather and the ancestors, taking an attribute from each generation that results in a strong individual. The presentation can be viewed as an almost literal interpretation of Rudine Sims Bishop&#x2019;s concept of a mirror book. An awe-inspiring compilation of poetry and art that will bring readers back again and again. Author: The Horn Book Magazine Source: Jan/Feb 2018<br><br>This dynamic collection of verse thrums with musical language, exploring the interconnectedness between individuals and generations, humanity and nature. Pulsing through each brief poem is a leitmotif of love, and Bryan&#x2019;s warm illustrations underscore the book&#x2019;s comforting refrain. While a few poems are bittersweet, dealing with aging and loss, serene and contented elements emerge amid the wistfulness. Non-religious spirituality pervades Giovanni&#x2019;s language with a reverence for nature, and for life itself, in simple words that will resonate with young and old. &#x201c;No Heaven&#x201d; questions &#x201c;How can there be/No heaven/When rain falls/gently on the grass/When sunshine scampers/across my toes.&#x201d; &#x201c;Kidnap Poem&#x201d; is especially metaphor-rich and overall lush, and the final poem, &#x201c;Do the Rosa Parks&#x201d; is perfect for reading to groups of young children, as it invites recitation and movement. Bryan&#x2019;s bold illustrations reflect the energy of the verses, splashing rainbows of rich color across every page. The paintings highlight a particularly poignant line or illuminate wording that some young readers might find complex, thereby aiding their meaning-making process. Children will especially enjoy the mirror included beside the poem &#x201c;I Am a Mirror,&#x201d; a luminous verse that speaks of resilience. VERDICT A recommended addition to all picture book poetry collections, one that encourages children to embrace their personal histories and to love and be loved. A vibrant burst of positivity for readers of any age.

The child of marginalized Scots-Irish immigrants, Rogers learned to survive in New England&#x2019;s dark and deadly forests, grasping, as did few others, that a new world required new forms of warfare. John F. Ross not only re-creates Rogers&#x2019;s life and his spectacular battles with breathtaking immediacy and meticulous accuracy, but brings a new and provocative perspective on Rogers&#x2019;s unique vision of a unified continent, one that would influence Thomas Jefferson and inspire the Lewis and Clark expedition. Rogers&#x2019;s principles of unconventional war-making would lay the groundwork for the colonial strategy later used in the War of Independence&#x2014;and prove so compelling that army rangers still study them today. Robert Rogers, a backwoods founding father, was heroic, admirable, brutal, canny, ambitious, duplicitous, visionary, and much more&#x2014;like America itself.</p><p>John F.

The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,<br>Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,<br>Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic,<br>Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.<br>Loud from its rocky caverns, the deep-voiced neighboring ocean<br>Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.&#x2014;<br>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Evangeline<br>Early one spring morning in 1739 James Rogers cinched the knots securing his family's belongings to an oxcart. Several sacks of corn kernels, some to be used for food, others for seed, huddled among well-worn tools and implements: an ax, a hoe, an iron pot, and a skillet. On the wagon's sill he propped his heavy smoothbore, loaded and primed with powder and shot. The New Hampshire air still carried the lingering bite of winter. Nearby the Spicket River gurgled more quietly than usual, denied its usual springtime roar by two years of drought.<br><br>The fir-shaded clearing in front of the small log cabin bustled with even more activity than usual for this characteristically large frontier family. His wife, Mary, brought out the last belongings, while their 13-year old daughter, Martha, looked after her mother's two-year-old namesake. Their five sons&#x2014;Daniel, 16, Samuel, 14, James, 11, Robert, 7, Richard, 5&#x2014;dashed around. In November James the elder had bought a one-sixth interest in 2,190 acres of tallgrass meadow and evergreen forest 35 miles northwest of their present 44-acre homestead in Methuen.<br><br>During the long winter evenings James had read to the children from his small but choice library, which included the Geneva Bible that he had carried over from Ireland. He may have enthralled them with the resourcefulness of the shipwrecked hero of Robinson Crusoe, one of the few novels forever passing from hand to hand on the frontier. Buried in that grave but spirit-raising adventure lay a moral that resonated with those who ventured into any wilderness: things get done not by wishing but by willing. Perhaps for young Robert, as Friday passed out of the unknown into Robin's service, the story lent strength to the idea that friends could be found in the impassive wilderness.<br><br>James may have also read them The Pilgrim's Progress, Bunyan's allegorical epic, in which the highest qualities of worldly adventure sweep through the Slough of Despond and Valley of the Shadow of Death up Hill Difficulty and on to face "Apollyon straddling over the whole breadth of the way" and Giant Despair, fit enemies for journeyers to overcome. After the hardship of the passage on which many would fail, the traveler could expect to enter the truly Celestial City along its streets paved in gold. These tales unlocked doors in the mind that opened to reveal unending vistas of the strange and wonderful. By naming and depicting things dark and mysterious, at first glance unconquerable but that proved vulnerable to hope and light, these tales had the power to awaken energies capable of driving back the inescapable terrors of the unknown.<br><br>For years James had yearned to own something more than this little clearing. While the banks of the Spicket returned rich yields of corn, barley, and flax, so confined a tract provided barely enough for him to feed himself, his wife, and seven children and to meet town taxes and their share of the local minister's keep. He and Mary had left Ulster a decade earlier in search of something more than this.<br><br>Nonetheless, no one could call the Rogerses poor. They were lucky too. The diphtheria epidemic that ravaged the region between 1735 and 1737 had overleaped them. In those three years it had struck terribly close, choking the life from 256 children in the adjacent town of Haverhill, swelling throats and filling them with ash-colored specks. Death from "throat distemper" came quickly, sometimes in as little as twelve tortured hours, carrying off small children most readily of all. Some families lost five or six children in the space of one nightmarish week. Within one year 984 settlers, 800 of them children under ten, had been swept away, not quite five percent of the entire New Hampshire colony.<br><br>James also looked forward to escaping the rarely hidden contempt shown by so many established colonists toward him and his fellow Scots-Irish. Ever since the Reverend Jamie MacGregor led the first wave of Ulster Presbyterians to northern New England 22 years before, the Puritans had made their lives difficult. In these proud, poor, and often violent newcomers, the older order found much to dislike: pride beyond their meanly assigned station and a spirited disregard for authority. Antipathy ran so deep that the Puritans even regarded the potato, which MacGregor's flock introduced to the region, as a fruit of the devil, a pernicious root unfit for Christian stomachs, imputing to it&#x2014;with an imagination that told more about the imaginers than it did about the humble esculent&#x2014;aphrodisiac powers.<br><br>John Greenleaf Whittier would capture this hostility by quoting an anonymous balladeer's gloating depiction of how, in the spring of 1719, the townsfolk of Haverhill had watched with amusement as an immigrant canoe heading upriver to MacGregor's settlement of Londonderry capsized in the rapids:<br><br>They began to scream and bawl,<br>As out they tumbled one and all,<br>And, if the Devil had spread his net,<br>He could have made a glorious haul!<br><br>In 1729 a Boston mob prevented a shipload of Ulster immigrants from coming ashore, leaving the sea-weary people to work their way up the Maine coast before they could set foot on land. Early-eighteenth-century New England was a homogeneous closed society, its coastal towns ruled by a religious elite who felt the hand of God's ordainments on their actions and policed obedience to the community with stifling social pressures. The newcomers struck at the heart of those iron conventions that had enabled the Puritan order to establish itself and survive in the New World. They spoke in a thick brogue, drank heavily, fought often, and spoke their minds when not asked. Their women often dressed provocatively. They prayed standing, not on their knees, like warriors gaining a promised land.<br><br>Although they worshipped a Protestant deity, their association, if only by geographical proximity in Ulster, with the Catholic Irish awoke deep fears among the Puritans. These first New Englanders had contended for decades with the papists of New France, who periodically whipped up the more or less converted Eastern Woodland peoples into murderous raids on the English settlements.<br><br>Rogers's ancestors knew something about Old World bloodshed. For many centuries violence consumed the basin of the upper Irish Sea: northern Ireland, the southern lowlands of Scotland, and the hills and valleys of northern England. In the past 700 years only three English monarchs had not invaded Scotland or found themselves defending their bloody borderlands against their northern neighbors. These windswept and treeless lands harbored tough, poor people who operated as often as not outside the reach of the law. Clans frequently sent bands "reiving" or preying on their neighbors. Cattle rustling and levying blackmail (then the term for protection money) was an enduring way of life, not an extreme remedy. Violence pervaded all aspects of these marginal men's lives to such a degree that weddings often featured simulated kidnappings of the bride, the groom and his friends joining together to "rescue" her. Such border violence hardened kinship relationships, often at the expense of allegiance to the distant Crown.<br><br>In the early 1600s James Rogers's forebears and thousands of other land-hungry border Scots had crossed the Northern Channel to settle the nine counties forming the northernmost province of Ireland. By the early 1700s conditions for the Scots Presbyterians of Ulster had deteriorated. The "rackrenting" practices of their absentee English landlords opened up leased property, long deemed to be held by perpetual hereditary right, to the highest bidder. Often several Irish Catholic families combined to outbid one Scots-Irish family, generations of which had toiled to improve the holding. New religious restrictions under Queen Anne ratcheted up resentment, while drought and economic depression added to their settler woes. In 1717 a first trickle of emigration to America began, swelling into a flood over the next 48 years as more than 150,000 people from Northern Ireland, mostly of Scots-Irish stock, set off.<br><br>Sometime between 1728 and 1731 James Rogers, his young wife Mary, and their four children, perhaps rackrented out of their home in Londonderry, joined the exodus, landing in Boston. Luck blessed them with a safe passage, albeit of two long months, though many of their fellow voyagers fell prey not only to the seas but to the callous merchants who jammed their vessels far beyond capacity with human cargo. On average, nearly a third of the passengers died. The parents of Robert Rogers's good friend John Stark lost all three of their young children to the foul holds.<br><br>The northeastern town of Methuen, on the Merrimack River just west of Haverhill, did not exactly embrace the Rogers family, but practicality often overrode dogma in America's always labor-poor interior. The elders&#x2014;some 65 taxpaying men&#x2014;sold them small parcels from the common pasture on the northern edge of town: these newcomers in their rough but defensible log cabins could serve as a first line of resistance to the fierce raiders from the north. Rogers's young sons would eventually enter the ranks of the all-too-often-mustered militia. On the Sabbathday, November 14, 1731, the town's young minister, Christopher Sargent, baptized one-week-old Robert, his family's first child born in North America, in the clapboard Congregationalist church on Meeting House Hill.<br><br>James Rogers made friends with his neighbor, Joseph Pudney, a former shopkeeper from Salem who also dreamed that the dangers of settling deeper into the wilderness would be more than offset by the scope and freedom there to be won. Pudney had much in common with Rogers, notably a houseful of children and a determination to better himself whatever the price in risk and labor. The two formed a plan to settle in the Great Meadows, a favorite hunting spot of theirs, 35 rough but promising miles northwest of Methuen: Rogers had purchased 365 acres for 11 pounds; Pudney received his title on an adjacent tract 12 days later.<br><br>The Rogers's oxcart pulled out, followed by haltered livestock&#x2014;a couple of cows and a horse&#x2014;and the ragtag procession joined the Pudneys to trudge along the banks of the Merrimack to Haverhill, where they picked up what passed for a road leading northwest to Rumford (today's Concord, New Hampshire), which had been hacked through the forest 13 years earlier. The travelers, perhaps the first oxcart party since the winter, encountered blowdowns&#x2014;large toppled trees whose sprawling branches had to be axed away. The cart had no brakes, so James and his strongest sons had to maneuver the heavy loads with care down every incline. The road jogged around massive granite boulders, scattered across the landscape as if some Brobdingnagian child had been playing at marbles. A traveler in the eighteenth century noted that moss grew so thick on some trees that it fell in tufts like long hair. In places the forest fir, spruce, oak, yellow birch, elm, and sugar maple gave way to spruce bogs thick with rotting tree trunks, their waters dark from the wood's decay.<br><br>At the yet-smaller town of Chester, 15 miles from Haverhill, the caravan turned west toward the Merrimack, along Cohas Brook, its banks lined with magnificent specimens of arrow-straight white pine (cohas in Algonquin), some towering 250 feet and stretching eight feet across. The Crown had laid claim to these trees for the masts and spars of its world-class Royal Navy. Every ship of the line required a mainmast at least 40 inches in diameter and 40 yards in height, as well as foremasts, mainyards, bowsprits, mizzenmasts nearly as formidable. When a gust of wind passed through these cathedral groves as yet untouched by ax, the canopies shook and sighed like the murmur of a distant sea.<br><br>Rogerses and Pudneys crossed the Merrimack on John Goffe Jr.'s ferry, then took an even rougher track along the west bank to Amoskeag Falls, the most powerful stretch of white water along all the river's 110 miles. Half a mile north Black Brook, so named from the inkiness of its water, fell into the Merrimack from the west, and as the weary party swung upstream, the reality of their commitment now settled upon the youngest. Cutting back saplings and cajoling the oxen, they embarked on the last eight-mile push, their pace by now a crawl. They slept underneath the wagons, some kept awake by the howls of a nearby wolf pack that smelled the uneasy livestock. Not too many years before and not a dozen miles from where they lay, Zerobbabel Snow had been treed by wolves at dusk while out hunting. Frantically he blazed away with his fowling piece, but the pack stood its ground. His lead running out, he shot his coat buttons at the gray shadows. Only the next morning's daylight finally chased them away. While wolves rarely if ever attack humans, black bears and catamounts&#x2014;mountain lions&#x2014;do. Catamounts can measure up to nine feet from nose to tail and weigh up to 200 pounds. Around that time a ten-square-mile section of deciduous hardwoods in eastern North America might have maintained five black bears, two or three catamounts, and one to three gray wolves, as well as two elk, 30 red foxes, 400 deer, 200 turkeys, and up to 20,000 squirrels.<br><br>What relief must the incomers have felt when they finally parted the last branches and beheld the Great Meadows, a beaver-cleared opening of tallgrass in the interminable forest, reaching uphill and enclosed by forest. A stream ran through it, filling a large beaver pond at their feet. James and Mary Rogers named their homestead Mountalona, in memory of the Mounterloney Mountains of the Ireland they had left behind.<br><br>The two families threw up a crude log habitation known as a "half-faced camp." Two forked posts dug into the ground about ten feet apart supported a pole, up against which were stacked small horizontal logs, one side left open and roofed with bark. This makeshift shelter would house the livestock once the cabin was built.<br><br>The main cabin was wrought of tree trunks, split through the middle or "squared on the rough," and placed on each other to form a rectangle. Saddle notches cut into the ends of each log afforded a basic fit. The cabin required no nails to be hammered or sockets to be made in the some 80 logs, 20 to 30 feet in length; split logs were used for roof. The cabin the Rogerses built that spring and summer consisted of a single large room, divided by quilts hanging from ropes stretched between hooks in the rafters. At bedtime the children climbed a ladder into a loft and fell asleep under bearskins teeming with fleas and lice. A plank door and shutters closed out the elements. Bark shingle or pine clapboards covered the roof. Old World flourishes may have decorated the cabin, perhaps a double cross on the door, witch hazel and lilac bushes in the yard, and witch balls on the roof to keep away evil spirits.</p><h2>You Make Me Crazy Small Group Study Guide</h2><p><p>We all have relationships that drive us crazy.

Chapters give detailed coverage of critical topics: design options, selecting and supervising the architect and contractor, cost estimates, budgets, plan specifications, contracts, dealing with town officials and keeping track of everything along the way. For each stage of the project there is detailed information on common pitfalls and how to avoid them, as well as insiders&#39; tips which reveal what most contractors can&#39;t tell you. This book was previously published by Warner Books (2004) and titled What the &#34;Experts&#34; May Not Tell You About Building or Renovating Your Home.</p><p>This is the bestselling book of its type for good reason. It&#x2019;s exactly what owners need and want to know before they start a building project. It&#x2019;s frank, insightful, well sequenced and gives the reader a fascinating look into the surprising culture of the construction industry. It addresses what all owners are worried about and plenty else they should be worried about. The reader will come away a savvy consumer with foresight, prepared and focused on the right things to ensure their project is a success.<p>Creating a dream home just shouldn't be a nightmare, but hiring people to design and build for you is an enormous investment and a high-risk endeavor involving decisions that will last forever. Most homeowners spend about 20% of their time on the plan and 80% of their time on a messy, traumatic, expensive construction phase, often with bad consequences. Pros spend 80% of their time on the plan and 20% on a smooth construction phase with the desired outcome. But the homeowners can't know what goes into a solid plan unless someone tells them. After years of hearing bright people tell me horror stories about their experiences I thought &#x2018;If owners knew even a fraction of what the professionals did, they could avoid most of these problems.&#x2019; I hope you find this book illuminating and helpful. Best of luck with your project.</p></p><h2>Fed Up: An Insider&#39;s Take on Why the Federal Reserve is Bad for America</h2><p><b>A Federal Reserve insider pulls back the curtain on the secretive institution that controls America&#x2019;s economy<br></b><br> After correctly predicting the housing crash of 2008 and quitting her high-ranking Wall Street job, Danielle DiMartino Booth was surprised to find herself recruited as an analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, one of the regional centers of our complicated and widely misunderstood Federal Reserve System. She was shocked to discover just how much tunnel vision, arrogance, liberal dogma, and abuse of power drove the core policies of the Fed.<br><br> DiMartino Booth found a cabal of unelected academics who made decisions without the slightest understanding of the real world, just a slavish devo�tion to their theoretical models. Over the next nine years, she and her boss, Richard Fisher, tried to speak up about the dangers of Fed policies such as quanti�tative easing and deeply depressed interest rates. But as she puts it, &#x201c;In a world rendered unsafe by banks that were too big to fail, we came to understand that the Fed was simply too big to fight.&#x201d;<br><br> Now DiMartino Booth explains what <i>really </i>happened to our economy after the fateful date of December 8, 2008, when the Federal Open Market Committee approved a grand and unprecedented ex�periment: lowering interest rates to zero and flooding America with easy money. As she feared, millions of individuals, small businesses, and major corporations made rational choices that didn&#x2019;t line up with the Fed&#x2019;s &#x201c;wealth effect&#x201d; models. The result: eight years and counting of a sluggish &#x201c;recovery&#x201d; that barely feels like a recovery at all.<br><br> While easy money has kept Wall Street and the wealthy afloat and thriving, Main Street isn&#x2019;t doing so well. Nearly half of men eighteen to thirty-four live with their parents, the highest level since the end of the Great Depression. Incomes are barely increasing for anyone not in the top ten percent of earners. And for those approaching or already in retirement, extremely low interest rates have caused their savings to stagnate. Millions have been left vulnerable and afraid.<br> Perhaps worst of all, when the next financial crisis arrives, the Fed will have no tools left for managing the panic that ensues. And then what?<br><br> DiMartino Booth pulls no punches in this expos� of the officials who run the Fed and the toxic culture they created. She blends her firsthand experiences with what she&#x2019;s learned from dozens of high-powered market players, reams of financial data, and Fed docu�ments such as transcripts of FOMC meetings.<br><br> Whether you&#x2019;ve been suspicious of the Fed for decades or barely know anything about it, as DiMartino Booth writes, &#x201c;Every American must understand this extraordinarily powerful institution and how it affects his or her everyday life, and fight back.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Danielle DiMartino Booth&nbsp;</b>is the founder of Money Strong, LLC, an economic consulting firm. She began her career in New York at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and Credit Suisse, where she worked fixed income and the public and private equity markets. After work�ing as a financial columnist at the <i>Dallas Morning News</i>, DiMartino Booth spent nine years as an adviser to Richard Fisher at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. She lives in Dallas with her family.Chapter 1<br><br> "Groupstink"<br><br> Never in the field of monetary policy was so much gained by so few at the expense of so many.<br><br> -Michael Hartnett, Bank of America Merrill Lynch chief investment strategist, November 1, 2015<br><br> Early morning, December 16, 2008, with a drizzle of freezing rain falling, few would even glance at the line of inconspicuous Mercury Marquis sedans pulling up to Washington, DC's Fairmont Hotel. Emerging from the luxurious four-star establishment, their Foggy Bottom home eight times a year, are eleven little-known bureaucrats with their contingent of requisite subordinates.<br><br> There is no fanfare to mark the coming momentous decision they are to take on as they comfortably settle in for the ten-minute caravan to the neoclassical white marble edifice known as the Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building, located at Twentieth Street and Constitution Avenue NW.<br><br> Another half dozen of their peers had already left their homes in nearby Georgetown or some other Washington suburb and they too are making their way to the same address for the all-important 9 a.m. meeting.<br><br> Only one of these bureaucrats-the chairman, a mild-mannered former professor-might have been recognized in an American airport. The rest-unelected, immune to political pressure, mostly academics, and save one, inexperienced in the intricacies of running a major corporation, or even a small business-were virtually invisible outside the narrow world they inhabited despite the enormous power they wielded.<br><br> As these seventeen people arrived, they stowed their coats and umbrellas, grabbed a cup of coffee or tea, and mingled, the low hum of their conversation perhaps more subdued than on similar occasions. The day before, the first of the two-day affair, had been extraordinary in both the dire picture it painted of the American economy and the realization that they would have to take bold and unprecedented action.<br><br> That next sleety morning, they met again, determined to take action to prop up a faltering Wall Street, hopelessly mired in the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression. Even as they convened, the wreckage of the previous three months still burned around them. Credit markets had seized up and fears for the fate of the economy were mounting.<br><br> With a few exceptions, virtually all of those at the meeting were PhD economists who had earned doctorates at MIT, Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and other top American universities. They met under the auspices of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the decision-making body of the Federal Reserve System. They believed a lifetime of study in economic theory and monetary policy had given them unique insight to steer policy for the most powerful central bank in the world, the lender of last resort for failing Wall Street banks, and the U.S. government's last line of defense against utter financial chaos.<br><br> Created in 1913 after the Panic of 1907, the Federal Reserve was founded to keep the public's faith in the buying power of the U.S. dollar. After failing miserably in the 1930s, the Fed aimed to be more responsive. This led the institution to find discipline in the rising macroeconomic models championed by top monetary theorists. During the ensuing "Quiet Period" in American banking, deposit insurance prevented panics, the Fed controlled interest rates and manipulated the money supply, and though occasional disruptions flared, like the failure of Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company in 1984, no systemic risk erupted for seventy years. The Fed had tamed the volatile U.S. economy.<br><br> Until September 2008, when all hell broke loose in a worldwide panic that completely blindsided and, embarrassed the Federal Reserve. The Fed had used billions of dollars in taxpayer funds to bail out Wall Street fat cats. Everyone blamed the Fed.<br><br> Just before 9 a.m., the door to the chairman's office opened. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke took his place in an armchair at the center of a massive oval table. The members of the FOMC found their designated places around the table; aides sat in chairs or couches against the wall. With staff, the room contained fifty or sixty people, far more than normal for this momentous occasion.<br><br> In front of each FOMC member was a microphone to record their words for posterity. To a casual observer, the content of their conversation would be obscured by economic jargon.<br><br> This day, their essential task was to vote on whether to take the "fed funds" rate-the interest rate at which banks lent money to each other in the overnight market-to the zero bound. The history-making low rate would ripple throughout the economy, affecting the price to borrow for businesses and consumers alike.<br><br> Bernanke was calm but insistent. His lifetime of study of the Great Depression indicated this was the only way. His sheer depth of knowledge about the Fed's mishandling of that tragic period was undoubtedly intimidating.<br><br> By the end of the meeting, the vote was unanimous. The FOMC officially adopted a zero-interest-rate policy in the hopes that companies teetering on the brink of insolvency would keep the lights on, keep employees on their payrolls, and keep consumers spending. It would even pay banks interest on deposits.<br><br> Free cash. We'll even pay you to take it!<br><br> As they gathered their belongings, everyone shook hands, all very collegial despite the sometimes vigorous discussion. They journeyed back to their nice homes in the toniest neighborhoods of America's richest cities: New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, Washington, DC.<br><br> They returned to their lofty perches, some at the Eccles Building, others to the executive floors of Federal Reserve District Bank buildings, safely cushioned from the decision they had just made. Most of them were wealthy or had hefty defined benefit pensions. Their investments were socked away in blind trusts. They would feel no pain in their ivory towers.<br><br> It took a few months, but the Fed's mouth-to-mouth resuscitation brought gasping investment banks and hedge funds and giant corporations back to life. Wall Street rejoiced.<br><br> But the Fed's academic models never addressed one basic question: What happens to everyone else?<br><br> In the decade following that fateful day, everyday Americans began to suffer the aftereffects of the Fed's decision. By 2016, the interest rate still sat at the zero bound and the Fed's balance sheet had ballooned to $4.5 trillion, thanks to the Fed's "quantitative easing" (QE), the label given its continuing purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.<br><br> To what end? All around are signs of an economy frozen in motion thanks to the Fed's bizarre manipulations of monetary policy, all intended to keep the economy afloat.<br><br> The direct damage inflicted on our citizenry begins with our youngest minds and scales up to every living generation in our country's midst.<br><br> The journey could begin anywhere, but let's start in Erie, Pennsylvania, an area of the country that was struggling even before 2008. The Fed's high interest rates in the 1980s killed its steel and auto industries. The zero bound has dealt the region another devastarting blow. Now, in an Erie elementary school students are given stapled copies of "Everyday Mathematics" instead of an actual textbook. After a snowstorm, twenty-one buckets were deployed to catch leaks because there was no money to repair the roof. In the last five years, the Erie school district has laid off one fifth of its employees and closed three schools to cut costs. School officials are being forced to divert budgets earmarked for kids and facilities to cover the shortfall in its teacher pension fund, starved for yield in a zero-interest-rate environment where bonds return only 1 to 2 percent.<br><br> This is not limited to Erie. By mid-2016, long-term returns for U.S. public pensions have dropped to the lowest levels ever recorded-a $1.25 trillion funding gap-forcing pension fund managers from New York to California to resort to ever-riskier investments to meet their legal obligations-and to cut services to make up the shortfall.<br><br> Ruining Americans' pension systems? The professor and the FOMC had not anticipated that particular side effect.<br><br> And then there are the millennials, the 77 million young people born between 1980 and 1995. As private equity surged into real estate, purchasing homes to be used as rentals in search of higher yields, house prices have soared and the market share of first-time home buyers has dropped to its lowest level in almost thirty years. Nearly half of males and 36 percent of females age eighteen to thirty-four live with their parents, the highest level since the 1940s.<br><br> Delaying household formation and all the consumer spending that goes with that? Not on the FOMC's radar.<br><br> Even with mortgage rates at record lows, stagnant wages have made it difficult for millennials to amass down payments. Builders anxious to maximize returns now focus on constructing expensive houses, leaving fewer starter homes for sale in urban areas favored by today's young adults. It is an ominous trend for baby boomers. For many, home equity makes up the bulk of their retirement savings.<br><br> Killing the move-up housing market? Nope, the FOMC didn't foresee that either.<br><br> Chances are pretty good that most boomers didn't get the gist of the statement released by the Fed on that December day in 2008. A certificate of deposit (CD) now pays a hair above nothing. Those boomers-my mom among them-have taken a long hard look at their retirement accounts and realized with a sense of dread that a lifetime of scrimping and risk-averse investing has left their nest eggs vulnerable to serious erosion.<br><br> With interest rates on CDs near zero, the average boomer household would need $10.6 million in principal to safely earn $15,930 in interest, the annual income at the federal poverty-line level for a family of two.<br><br> Do your folks have $10 million in savings? Mine don't.<br><br> Of course, with $10 million, CDs might not be on the table, but that's the point. Several hundred thousand dollars won't do the trick without undue risk for aging boomers.<br><br> The members of the FOMC knew their decision would screw savers and the risk-averse elderly. They didn't care. They couldn't afford to. Even when well-intentioned smart people save the world, there are always a few, or in this case, millions of inevitable casualties. C'est la vie!<br><br> Sadly, there were no angry protests, no million-man marches on Washington that sent shock waves through our country after the FOMC issued its press release. Only the quiet, unheralded loss of some fundamental freedoms: the freedom to save for our retirements risk free, the freedom to sleep in peace knowing our pensions are safe, and the freedom for U.S. companies to invest in our nation's future.<br><br> The FOMC's vote during its final meeting of 2008 didn't come from nowhere. It was part of a long tradition of economic interference by well-meaning bureaucrats, going back to the 1930s and accelerating with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in the 1980s.<br><br> Greenspan championed the era of financial deregulation that drove Wall Street to levels of greed that surprised even the most hardened investment banking veterans.<br><br> His pragmatic response to every crisis on Wall Street? Lower interest rates, which Greenspan did again and again and again. Blow bubbles and pray they don't pop.<br><br> But they always do.<br><br> In the late 1990s, dot-com companies soared far beyond true valuations; reality pricked that balloon in 2001.<br><br> In response, Greenspan again aggressively lowered interest rates and blew another bubble, this time in housing, with catastrophic results that led to the worldwide meltdown in 2008.<br><br> In response, his successor, Ben Bernanke, followed suit, pushing through a massive monetary policy experiment by lowering interest rates to zero and using QE to flood America with easy money.<br><br> He based his policies on a lifetime of academic study. His theoretical models relied on the idea of the "wealth effect," first articulated by British economist John Maynard Keynes. The concept assumed that free money would induce businesses to borrow, invest, and hire more employees. They in turn would buy homes, consume, and put savings into the stock market instead of CDs, where they would earn little to no interest. As their assets rose in value, people would spend more.<br><br> The resulting wealth-effect tide would lift all boats. Hailed as a genius by other academics, Bernanke had every confidence his theories would work.<br><br> When they didn't, when the American economy continued to stagger, Bernanke doubled down. His models couldn't be wrong; something else must be holding back the economy.<br><br> Janet Yellen, who followed Bernanke as Fed chair, maintained his radical policies with gusto, determined that households and businesses would invest, buy, consume, damn it! Though many on the FOMC sought an exit plan, Yellen was even more married to the Keynesian model of economic growth than Bernanke. She continued to advocate for more QE, and has even raised the specter of negative interest rates.<br><br> But real people haven't responded the way academics anticipated in their wealth-effect models. Individuals, small businesses, and corporations alike have been flummoxed by Fed policy and made their own rational choices unforeseen by the FOMC.<br><br> Cheap money, combined with uncertainty about the regulatory and tax landscape, has encouraged corporations to buy back their shares rather than invest in their future. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index-the benchmark for America's top five hundred publically listed companies-dispersed more than $600 billion to buy back their stock in 2014, and more than $500 billion in 2015.<br><br> This strategy has been employed by companies as diverse as Apple, Bank of America, and ExxonMobil, which lost its prized AAA credit rating after one hundred years, based partially on the record amount of debt it incurred to buy back shares. Since 2005, U.S. corporations have disbursed an estimated $296,000 on share buybacks for every single new employee who has been hired.<br><br> Because that's the way the world works.<br><br> "No wonder share buybacks and corporate investment into research and development have moved inversely in recent years," wrote Rana Foroohar in an op-ed in the Financial Times on May 15, 2016. "It is easier for chief executives with a shelf life of three years to try to please investors by jacking up short-term share prices than to invest in things that will grow a company over the long haul."<br><br> Compared to the immediate post-World War II period, some American corporations now earn about five times more revenue from purely financial activities such as trading, hedging, tax optimization, and selling financial services, as compared to their core businesses.<br><br> As a result, the labor market has atrophied. Though lots of so-called eat, drink, and get sick jobs-for waiters, bartenders, and health care workers-have been created, Fed policy effectively pulled the plug on long-term investment and compromised high-paying job growth.<br><br> By mid-2015, only 62.6 percent of adult workers were employed or actively looking for a job, the lowest in nearly four decades. The so-called shadow unemployment rate is estimated to be as high as 23 percent. Many of these people will never come back into the workforce.</p><h2>S M L XL</h2><p><i>S,M,L,XL</i> presents a selection of the remarkable visionary design work produced by the Dutch firm Office for Metropolitan Architecture (O.M.A.) and its acclaimed founder, Rem Koolhaas, in its first twenty years, along with a variety of insightful, often poetic writings. The inventive collaboration between Koolhaas and designer Bruce Mau is a graphic overture that weaves together architectural projects, photos and sketches, diary excerpts, personal travelogues, fairy tales, and fables, as well as critical essays on contemporary architecture and society.<br><br> The book's title is also its framework: projects and essays are arranged according to scale. While Small and Medium address issues ranging from the domestic to the public, Large focuses on what Koolhaas calls "the architecture of Bigness." Extra-Large features projects at the urban scale, along with the important essay "What Ever Happened to Urbanism?" and other studies of the contemporary city. Running throughout the book is a "dictionary" of an adventurous new Koolhaasian language -- definitions, commentaries, and quotes from hundreds of literary, cultural, artistic, and architectural sources.</p><p><b>Rem Koolhaas </b>is founder of the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (O.M.A.); the firm's most important projects include the Lille Grand Palais in Lille; the Kunsthal in Rotterdam; Netherlands Dance Theatre in The Hague; Nexus Housing in Fukuoka; the Dutch House in Holland; and Villa dall'Ava in Paris, all of which are included in <i>S,M,L,XL</i>. Koolhaas is author of the seminal <i>Delirious New York</i> and professor in practice of architecture and urban design at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. <br><br><b>Bruce Mau</b> founded the critically acclaimed firm Bruce Mau Design in 1985. He is the author of <i>Life Style</i> and <i>Massive Change.</i><br><br><i> </i>Koolhaas, Dutch architect, author (Delirious New York) and cult figure, wants architecture to be "a chaotic adventure," and this massive tome certainly is. Created with Toronto-based designer Mau, it's a huge collage splicing freewheeling essays, diary excerpts, photographs, architectural plans, sketches, cartoons and surreal montages of images. There's also a running glossary of Zen-like definitions, plus fables and parables intended to shake modern architects out of conventional thinking and to dispel urban despair. In one essay, Koolhaas admires Japan's metabolist movement, which fuses organic, scientific, mechanistic and romantic vocabularies. That approach seems compatible with his own innovative, eclectic vision as head of the Dutch firm Office of Metropolitan Architecture (O.M.A.), whose houses, villas, office towers, libraries, colleges, cultural complexes and other projects are showcased here. While some readers may be mystified by a nonlinear hodgepodge, architects, planners and designers will find this frequently outrageous assemblage a provocative repository of ideas.

These documents, which span the Reformer's literary career, point to the enduring and flexible character of his central ideas. As Luther's reform proposals emerged, they coalesced around some basic priorities, which he delivered to wide-ranging audiences--writing for children, preaching in congregations, formulating academic treatises, penning letters to family and friends, counter-punching critics, summarizing Biblical books, crafting confessions of faith, and more. This book demonstrates that range and provides entry points, for non-specialists and specialists alike, into the thought and life of the epoch-defining, fascinating, and controversial Martin Luther. With attention to the breadth of his literary output, it draws from his letters, sermons, popular writings, and formal theological works. This breadth allows readers to encounter Luther the man: the sinner and the saint, the public activist and the private counselor, the theologian and the pastor. These writings possess a practical, accessible arc, as Luther does not write only for specialists and church officials, but he applies his chief insights to the "real-life" issues that faced his rather wide variety of audiences.</p><p><b>William Russell</b>, pastor and scholar, serves Augustana Lutheran Church, Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he investigates the life and work of Martin Luther.

At the 500th Anniversary of the Reformation, this volume makes it easy to sit down, open the cover and discover anew what mattered to Luther then and what matters to many now.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br>&#x2014;<b>Patricia Lull, Bishop of Saint Paul Area Synod, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Judiciously selected writings of the Reformer, crisply translated and chronologically presented by Luther scholar William R. Russell, just in time for the 500th anniversary of the Lutheran Reformation. Beginning with the document that ignited the Reformation, &#x201c;The Ninety-Five Theses&#x201d; and concluding with a sermon from 1539, Russell has provided a fine anthology of Luther&#x2019;s literary legacy that will lend itself for use in classrooms and congregations. It will also serve a broader audience interested in gaining insights into the Reformation as Russell provides primary texts as we are given a sampling of polemical and pastoral writings (including sermons and letters) as well as his theological and confessional documents. Each entry is accompanied with a succinct but careful introduction providing the reader with its historical context as well as a thematic orientation to Luther&#x2019;s thought.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b>John T. Pless, Assistant Professor of Pastoral Ministry and Missions, Concordia Theological Seminary<br><br></b>&#x201c;Meet the classic&nbsp;Martin Luther&#x2014;defiant in his challenge to earthly authority, disarmingly simple in his faith, and utterly pastoral in his&nbsp;love of the gospel.&nbsp;His words are messages in a bottle from his fractured world to our own. Russell's judicious selections and thoughtful introduction constitute a personal invitation to the general reader. I can think of no better way to encounter the Great Reformer&#x2014;again.&#x201d; &nbsp;<b><br>&#x2014;Richard Lischer,&nbsp; Duke Divinity School&nbsp;<br><br></b>&#x201c;The writings of Martin Luther comprise more than 100 massive volumes. How to make him accessible, especially in the exciting anniversary year of 2017? William Russell&#x2019;s judicious selection of shorter texts drawn from the full span of Luther&#x2019;s almost-forty year career as a pastor and theologian answers that question compellingly. The collection provided here includes such standards as the 95 Theses, the Heidelberg Disputation, and the Small Catechism. Also included are such lesser known texts as the letter to Philip Melanchthon in which Luther&#x2019;s controversial advice to &#x201c;sin boldly&#x201d; is found, a number of sermons and shorter tracts that show Luther&#x2019;s pastoral side, as well as a few texts that highlight his swashbuckling style of theological argument. Freshly translated here, these texts are also expertly introduced in an informal style that eases the reader&#x2019;s way into Luther&#x2019;s world. The result is a one-volume collection that will work exceptionally well for college level courses, and which will be a treasure for interested readers of all kinds as well. A fine work!&#x201d;<b><br><b>&#x2014;</b>Mickey L. Mattox, Marquette University<br><br></b>&#x201c;A wonderful choice (...) Russell beautifully and poignantly prefaces the collection, introducing each writing with just enough information to enable an informed read.&#x201d;<b><br>&#x2014;<i>Episcopal Journal</i><br> &nbsp;<br> </b>&#x201c;Russell&#x2019;s translations are smooth and readable, making this volume an excellent entry point for the Luther novice. He also provides a useful glossary of names along with his own bibliographic notes and a list of suggested further reading. This is an excellent collection of writings by Martin Luther, freshly translated by a leading scholar in the field.&#x201d;<b> <br><b>&#x2014;</b><i>Publishers Weekly</i><br></b></p><h2>Mysterious Skin</h2><p><p>At the age of eight Brian Lackey is found bleeding under the crawl space of his house, having endured something so traumatic that he cannot remember an entire five&#x2013;hour period of time.</p><p> During the following years he slowly recalls details from that night, but these fragments are not enough to explain what happened to him, and he begins to believe that he may have been the victim of an alien encounter. Neil McCormick is fully aware of the events from that summer of 1981. Wise beyond his years, curious about his developing sexuality, Neil found what he perceived to be love and guidance from his baseball coach. Now, ten years later, he is a teenage hustler, a terrorist of sorts, unaware of the dangerous path his life is taking. His recklessness is governed by idealized memories of his coach, memories that unexpectedly change when Brian comes to Neil for help and, ultimately, the truth.</p></p><p><p>The author of two novels and a volume of poetry, Scott Heim has written for numerous publications, including <em>The Advocate</em>, <em>Village Voice</em>, and Nerve.com. He lives in Boston.</p>"The summer I was eight years old, five hours disappeared from my life"?so runs the catchy opening to Heim's impressive first novel. The speaker is Brian Lackey, now a troubled teenager, once an introverted kid growing up scared in the small town of Hutchinson, Kans. The reason for his memory lapse and his fear, as we and Brian learn during the course of the novel, turns out not to be the space aliens that he first suspects, but his molestation at the hands of his Little League coach. The key to Brian's reclamation of those lost hours is homosexual hustler Neil McCormick?the slugger on that Little League team and an accomplice to Brian's sexual abuse. Working its way over the course of a decade toward Brian and Neil's reunion, the narrative unfolds through chapters whose points of view alternate among Brian, Neil and a handful of their siblings and confidants. Heim makes numerous freshman mistakes, including a relatively static narrative, prominent characters who outlive their usefulness and occasional lapses in the writing. He also creates scenes of genuine beauty, however, and handles his complicated characters and delicate subject matter with calm assurance. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Edgar Allan Poe&#39;s Tales of Mystery and Madness</h2><p>A sweet little cat drives a man to insanity and murder.... <br> The grim death known as the plague roams a masquerade ball dressed in red.... <br> A dwarf seeks his final revenge on his captors.... <br> A sister calls to her beloved twin from beyond the grave.... <br> Prepare yourself.

Encouraged by the British, Indian tribes attacked settlers in the West, while the Royal Navy terrorized the coasts. By mid-1814, President James Madison&#x2019;s generals had lost control of the war in the North, losing battles in Canada. Then British troops set the White House ablaze, and a feeling of hopelessness spread across the country.<br><br>Into this dire situation stepped Major General Andrew Jackson. A native of Tennessee who had witnessed the horrors of the Revolutionary War and Indian attacks, he was glad America had finally decided to confront repeated British aggression. But he feared that President Madison&#x2019;s men were overlooking the most important target of all: New Orleans.<br><br>If the British conquered New Orleans, they would control the mouth of the Mississippi River, cutting Americans off from that essential trade route and threatening the previous decade&#x2019;s Louisiana Purchase. The new nation&#x2019;s dreams of western expansion would be crushed before they really got off the ground.<br><br>So Jackson had to convince President Madison and his War Department to take him seriously, even though he wasn&#x2019;t one of the Virginians and New Englanders who dominated the government. He had to assemble a coalition of frontier militiamen, French-speaking Louisianans,Cherokee and Choctaw Indians, freed slaves, and even some pirates. And he had to defeat the most powerful military force in the world&#x2014;in the confusing terrain of the Louisiana bayous.<br><br>In short, Jackson needed a miracle. The local Ursuline nuns set to work praying for his outnumbered troops. And so the Americans, driven by patriotism and protected by prayer, began the battle that would shape our young nation&#x2019;s destiny.<br><br>As they did in their two previous bestsellers, Kilmeade and Yaeger make history come alive with a riveting true story that will keep you turning the pages.

The former steps forth, and proclaims his readiness to march.<br><br> -Major General Andrew Jackson<br><br> On June 1, 1812, America declared war. After a hot debate, James Madison's war resolution was passed by a vote of 19-13 in the Senate and 79-49 in the House of Representatives, and, once again, the new nation would be taking on the world's premier military and economic power: Great Britain.<br><br> Twenty-nine years had passed since the colonists' improbable victory in the Revolutionary War, and for twenty-nine years the British had failed to respect American sovereignty. Now, the nation James Madison led had reached the limit of its tolerance. Great Britain's kidnapping of American sailors and stirring up of Indian tribes to attack settlers on the western frontier had made life intolerably difficult for many of America's second generation, including those hardscrabble men and women pushing the boundaries westward.<br><br> Though reluctant to risk the new nation's liberty, Madison was now ready to send a message to England and the world that America would stand up to the bully that chose to do her harm. The unanswered question was: Could America win? Less than thirty years removed from the last war, and with virtually no national army, were Americans prepared to take on Britain and defend themselves, this time without the help of France? The world was about to find out.<br><br> In fact, so many Americans opposed the war that the declaration posed a real risk to the country's national unity. The Federalist Party, mainly representing northerners whose economy relied on British trade, had unanimously opposed the war declaration. Many New Englanders wanted peace with Britain, and it was likely that some would even be willing to leave the Union in order to avoid a fight.<br><br> Yet peaceful attempts at resolving the conflict with Britain had already been tried-and hadn't helped the economy much. Five years earlier, when a British ship attacked the U.S. Navy's Chesapeake, killing three sailors and taking four others from the ship to impress them into service to the Crown, then president Thomas Jefferson had attempted to retaliate. To protest this blatant hostility, Congress passed the Embargo Act, prohibiting overseas trade with Great Britain. Unfortunately, the act hurt Americans more than the British. In just fifteen months, the embargo produced a depression that cruelly punished merchants and farmers while doing little to deter the Royal Navy's interference and hardening New England's resistance to conflict. Further attempts at legislative pressure in the early years of James Madison's presidency had little effect, and British impressment had continued. By the time of the war declaration in June 1812, the number of sailors seized off the decks of American ships had risen to more than five thousand men.<br><br> To many, including Andrew Jackson, then forty years old, the attack on the Chesapeake alone had been an insult to American pride that demanded a military response. As Jackson wrote to a Virginia friend after learning of the Chesapeake's fate, "The degradation offered to our government . . . has roused every feeling of the American heart, and war with that nation is inevitable."<br><br> Yet America had waited, and the losses at sea mounted. At the same time, attempts to pacify the British had only resulted in further losses in America's new territory, "the West," which ran south to north from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada, bounded on the west by the Mississippi. There British agents were said to be agitating the Indians. For many years, the Five Civilized Tribes in the region (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole) had maintained peaceful relations with the European arrivals. But as more and more white settlers moved into native territories, tensions had risen and open conflict had broken out. In some places, travelers could no longer be certain whether the Native Americans they encountered were friendly; for inhabitants of the frontier, that meant the events of daily life were accompanied by fear. Stories circulated of fathers who returned from a day of hunting to find their children butchered, and of wives who stumbled upon their husbands scalped in the fields.<br><br> A major Shawnee uprising in the Indiana Territory in 1811 escalated the fear. And as the bloodshed increased, there were reports that the British were providing the Indians with weapons and promising them land if they carried out violent raids against American settlers. For Andrew Jackson, the threat had become too close for comfort when, in the spring of 1812, just a hundred miles from his home, a marauding band of Creeks killed six settlers and took a woman hostage. Jackson was certain the British were behind the attack on the little settlement at the mouth of the Duck River.<br><br> Westerners like Jackson fumed at the government's inability to resolve the country's problems, but their clout in Washington was limited. The decision makers from Virginia and New England had little sympathy for their inland countrymen. Eastern newspapers poked fun at the hill folks' backward ways, and much of the territory west of the Appalachian Mountains remained mysterious and wild, with few good roads and even fewer maps. The dangers faced by westerners were not felt by easterners, and their anguished demands for retaliation were scorned and dismissed by those whose wallets would be hurt by the war.<br><br> But eventually, despite many politicians' disdain for their hick neighbors to the west, Washington politics had begun to shift along with the nation's growing population. The West had gained new influence in the elections of 1810 and 1811, when the region sent a spirited band of new representatives to the Capitol. These men saw British attitudes toward the United States as a threat to American liberty and independence; they also saw the need for westward expansion, a move that the British were trying to thwart. Led by a young Kentuckian named Henry Clay, they quickly gained the nickname War Hawks, because, despite the risks, they knew it was time to fight.<br><br> Clay became Speaker of the House and he, along with the War Hawks and like-minded Republicans from the coastal states, put pressure on the Madison administration. Now, after years of resistance, Madison listened, and with Congress's vote, the War of 1812 began. America decided to stand up for its sovereignty on the sea and its security in the West.<br><br> The War Hawks in Washington were ecstatic about the declaration of war, and so was Jackson in Tennessee. At last he would have the chance to defend the nation he loved, to protect his family and friends-and, personally, to take revenge on the nation that had left him alone and scarred so many years before.<br><br> The Boy Becomes a Man<br><br> A quarter century before, Jackson had swallowed his grudge. When the Treaty of Paris made U.S. independence official in 1783, the orphaned sixteen-year-old adopted America as his family.<br><br> Relatives had taken him in after his mother's death. He became a saddler's apprentice, then, his ambitions rising, he clerked for a North Carolina attorney. Andrew Jackson's cobbled-together upbringing would serve him well, though he also gained a reputation as a young man who loved drinking, playing cards, and horse racing.<br><br> Admitted to the bar to practice law at age twenty, a year later he accepted an appointment as a public prosecutor in North Carolina's western district. That took him beyond the boundaries of the state, to the other side of the Appalachians. Jackson arrived in a region that, a few years after his arrival, became the state of Tennessee.<br><br> The red-haired, blue-eyed, and rangy six-foot-one young man made an immediate impression in Nashville, a frontier outpost established just eight years earlier. As Jackson put down roots, he became one of its chief citizens as his and his city's reputations grew. His rise gained momentum after he met Rachel Donelson, the youngest daughter of one of Nashville's founding families. Dark-eyed Rachel was the prettiest of the Donelson sisters and full of life. It was said she was "the best story-teller, the best dancer, . . . [and] the most dashing horsewoman in the western country." Jackson was smitten, and after she extricated herself from a marriage already gone bad, he took her as his wife.<br><br> As a lawyer, a trader, and a merchant, Jackson bought and sold land. By the time Tennessee joined the Union, in 1796, he had won the respect of his neighbors, who chose him as their delegate to the state's constitutional convention. Jackson then served as Tennessee's first congressman for one session before becoming a U.S. senator. But he found life in the political realm of the Federal City frustrating-too little got done for the decisive young Jackson-and he accepted an appointment to Tennessee's Supreme Court. In the early years of the nineteenth century, he divided his energies between administering the law and establishing himself at his growing plantation, the Hermitage, ten miles outside Nashville. "His house was the seat of hospitality," wrote a young officer friend, "the resort of friends and acquaintances, and of all strangers visiting the state."<br><br> His next venture into public service would suit him better: thanks to his strong relationships and sound political instincts, he was elected major general of the Tennessee militia, in February 1802. Maintained by the state, not the federal government, the militia was provisioned by local men who supplied their own weapons and uniforms and served short contracts of a few months' duration. Leading the militia was a good fit for Jackson's style, because it gave him the chance to serve the people he loved with the freedom he needed and the challenge he craved.<br><br> General Jackson repeatedly won reelection as well as the deep loyalty of his men. They liked what he said. He was often outspoken, and many shared his uncompromising views on defending settlers' rights. With rumors of war, he was ready to defend his people and was just the man to rally westerners to the cause of American liberty. "Citizens!" he wrote in a broadside. "Your government has at last yielded to the impulse of a nation. . . . Are we the titled slaves of George the Third? The military conscripts of Napoleon the great? Or the frozen peasants of the Russian czar? No-we are the free-born sons of America; the citizens of the only republic now existing in the world."<br><br> Jackson understood the stakes of the war, and he recognized the strategy as only a westerner could. Of critical importance to victory in the West was a port city near the Gulf Coast. As Jackson would soon say to his troops, in the autumn of 1812, "Every man of the western country turns his eyes intuitively upon the mouth of the Mississippi." Together, he observed, "[we are] committed by nature herself [to] the defense of the lower Mississippi and the city of New Orleans."<br><br> The City of New Orleans<br><br> New Orleans was important-so important, in fact, that upon becoming president a dozen years earlier, Thomas Jefferson had made acquiring it a key objective. Recognizing the city's singular strategic importance to his young nation, he wrote, "There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans."<br><br> Knowing that Napoleon's plan for extending his American empire had suffered a major setback in the Caribbean, where his expeditionary force had been decimated by yellow fever, Jefferson sensed an opportunity. He dispatched his friend James Monroe to Paris, instructing him to try to purchase New Orleans.<br><br> Monroe had succeeded in his assignment beyond Jefferson's wildest dreams. Recognizing his resources were already overextended in his quest to dominate Europe, Napoleon agreed to sell all of Louisiana. That conveyed an immense wilderness to the United States, effectively doubling the size of the new country. The Louisiana Purchase had been completed in 1803 and, at a purchase price of $15 million for more than eight hundred thousand square miles of territory, the land had been a staggering bargain (the cost to America's treasury worked out to less than three cents an acre).<br><br> The Louisiana city of New Orleans was the great gateway to and from the heart of the country. America's inland waterways-the Ohio, the Missouri, and the numerous other rivers that emptied into the Mississippi-amounted to an economic lifeline for farmers, trappers, and lumbermen upstream. On these waters flatboats and keelboats were a common sight, carrying manufactured goods from Pennsylvania, as well as crops, pelts, and logs from the burgeoning farms and lush forests across the Ohio Valley, Cumberland Gap, and Great Smoky Mountains. On reaching the wharves, warehouses, and quays of New Orleans, the goods went aboard waiting ships to be transported all over the world.<br><br> Although Louisiana became a state in April 1812, the British still questioned the legitimacy of America's ownership of the Louisiana Territory-Napoleon had taken Louisiana from Spain and, to some Europeans, it remained rightfully a possession of the Spanish Crown. Jackson feared that sort of thinking could provide the British with just the pretext they needed to interfere with the American experiment-capturing New Orleans would be the perfect way to disrupt America's western expansion.<br><br> Now that America had finally gone to war, many nagging practical questions hung in the air in Washington. Who would determine America's military strategy? Who would lead the nation to war? The generals of the revolutionary generation were aging or dead. The passing of George Washington had sent the nation into mourning thirteen years before, and no military leader had the stature to take the general's place. Although the country had prevailed in the previous decade in a war on the Barbary Coast of North Africa, defeating pirate states that had attacked its shipping and held its men hostage, this was a bigger fight for even bigger stakes.<br><br> Although neither Mr. Madison nor the members of Congress could know it in June 1812, the burden of protecting the West would eventually settle onto the narrow but resilient shoulders of General Andrew Jackson, a man little known and less liked outside his region. But first Jackson had to convince the men in Washington that a general from the backwoods was the one to lead the fight. That would be anything but easy.<br><br> Chapter 2<br><br> How to Lose a War<br><br> Resolved, that we consider the war commenced against Great Britain under existing circumstances unnecessary, impolitic and ruinous.<br><br> - Citizens of Lincoln County, Maine, August 3, 1812<br><br> The Boston Evening Post soon dubbed the conflict "Mr. Madison's War." With no template to follow-he was the first American president ever to sign a formal declaration of war-James Madison was largely on his own.<br><br> There was nothing battle-hardened about Madison. Soft-spoken as well as short, he weighed perhaps 120 pounds. Genteel in manner, he was sickly and bookish, with a face that bore the age lines of a man of sixty-one years. He was a far cry from the strategist George Washington had been and had little choice when it came to military matters but to rely on the advice of his counselors. Many of them also lacked war experience.</p><h2>Confronting Familiar Spirits: Counterfeits to the Holy Spirit</h2><p><p>FAMILIAR SPIRITS ARE <em>COUNTERFEITS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</em></p> <p>So much of Satan's kingdom on earth is based on the transmission of knowledge and power from the supernatural realm to the physical realm.</p> <p>A person can form and develop a close relationship with an evil spirit, willfully or through ignorance.When a person forms a relationship with an evil spirit, he then <em>has a familiar spirit. </em>People can gain influence and talent, they can become powerful and wealthy, through forming a relationship with evil spirits or "spirit guides." <em>All of it, every ounce of their gain is based on the counterfeiting of the wortk of the Holy Spirit. </em></p> <p>The danger that arises from accessing supernatural power other than through the Holy Spirit is that it brings <strong>spiritual defilement. </strong></p> <p>&#x201c;Regard not them that have familiar spirits... to be<strong> defiled by them</strong>: I am the Lord your God.&#x201d; (Lev. 19:31)</p> <p>Anyone who has fellowship with God, and who is led by the Holy Spirit, <em>does not need</em> a familiar spirit, for God provides him with all that he needs.

Desperate to find her, the police called physicist Russell Targ and Pat Price, a psychic retired police commissioner. As Price turned the pages of the police mug book filled with hundreds of photos, suddenly he pointed to one of them and announced, "That's the ringleader." The man was Donald DeFreeze, who was indeed subsequently so identified. Price also described the type and location of the kidnap car, enabling the police to find it within minutes. That remarkable event is one reason Targ believes in ESP. Another occurred when his group made $120,000 by forecasting for nine weeks in a row the changes in the silver-commodity futures market</p><p>As a scientist, Targ demands proof. His experience is based on two decades of investigations at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), which he cofounded with physicist Harold Puthoff in 1972. This twenty-million dollar program launched during the Cold War was supported by the CIA, NASA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and Army and Air Force Intelligence. The experiments they conducted routinely presented results could have happened by chance less than once in a million. Targ describes four types of experiments:<br><br></p><ol><li>Remote Viewing, in which a person describes places and events independent of space and time. For example, while in California Price drew to scale a Soviet weapons factory at Semipalitinsk with great accuracy later confirmed by Satellite photography. In another remote viewing, Targ accurately sketched an airport in San Andreas, Columbia himself.</li><li>Distant Mental Influence, where the thoughts of the experimenter can positively or negatively affect the physiology (heart rate, skin resistance, etc.) of a distant person.<br></li><li>Whole field isolation, where someone in a state of sensory isolation accurately describes the visual experiences of someone else in another place</li><li>Precognition and retrocausality, showing that the future can affect the past. That is, the elephant you see on television in the morning can be the cause of your having dreamed about elephants the previous night.</li></ol><p></p><p>Final chapters present evidence for survival after death; explain how ESP works based on the Buddhist/Hindu view of our selves as nonlocal, eternal awareness; discuss the ethics of exercising psychic abilities,and show us how to explore ESP ourselves. "I am convinced," Targ says, "that most people can learn to move from their ordinary mind to one not obstructed by conventional barriers of space and time. Who would not want to try that?"</p></p><p><b>Russell Targ</b> is a physicist and author, and was a pioneer in the development of the laser and laser applications. He holds his B.S. in Physics from Queens College, and did graduate work in physics at Columbia University. Targ has received two National Aeronautics and Space Administration awards for inventions and contributions in lasers and laser communications, and has published over one hundred scientific papers on lasers, plasma physics and ESP research. In the 1970s and 1980s, Targ co-founded and worked for the CIA-sponsored Stanford Research Institute's investigation into psychic abilities. His work in this new area, called remote viewing, was published in <i>Nature, The Proceedings of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</i> and in Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1983 and 1984, he accepted invitations to present remote viewing demonstrations and address the USSR Academy of Sciences on this research. In 1997, Targ retired from Lockheed Martin Missiles &amp; Space Co. as a senior staff scientist, where he developed airborne laser systems for the detection of windshear. Targ now teaches remote viewing workshops worldwide and continues to write. He is co-author of eight books dealing with the scientific investigation of psychic abilities, including <i>Limitless Mind: A Guide to Remote Viewing, Transformation of Consciousness</i>, and his autobiography <i>Do You See What I See?: Memoirs of a Blind Biker</i>. Russell Targ is also an editor, publisher, songwriter, producer and teacher. He lives in Palo Alto, California with his wife Patricia."A scientist shares his years of cutting-edge research and discovery in psychic abilities: remote viewing, extrasensory perception, mental influence, space and time, healing at a distance and "how it all works: the physics of miracles." <br>--<i>Light of Consciousness<br></i><br><br>"In this witty and informative new book, physicist-author and renowned psi researcher Targ summarizes three decades of research into psychic phenomena, describing the evidence as "so strong as to be logically or probabilistically unreasonable to deny."

He is a fencing master and a man of honor, an anachronism. For years he has been working on a Treatise on the Art of Fencing, the heart of which is his perfection of the unstoppable thrust. He is approached one day by a beautiful and mysterious woman with a scar at the corner of her mouth that hints at dark violence. She asks the maestro to teach her the unstoppable thrust. Even though Do-a Adela de Otero's weapons of charm and elegance are formidable, Don Jaime declines. But he is entirely unprepared for the unhurried, sure, and inexplicable movements that follow. Soon he finds himself involved in a plot that includes seduction, politics, secret documents, and murder. Rich with the historical detail of a decaying world that agonizes-as does the art of fencing-over ideals of honor and chivalry, The Fencing Master is superb literature and an honest-to-goodness page-turner.<br></p><p>In <i>The Club Dumas</i>, Arturo P�rez-Reverte explored the labyrinthine world of antiquarian book dealers, spicing his tale of mystery and murder with characters straight out of <i>Paradise Lost</i> and <i>The Three Musketeers</i>. Next came <i>The Flanders Panel</i>, a brilliant puzzle comprised of art, chess, and untimely death whose resolution lies in a painting by a Flemish master. In <i>The Seville Communion</i>, P�rez-Reverte turned his sights on the tangled politics of the Roman Catholic Church as an appropriate backdrop--for murder. In his fourth novel translated into English, the Spanish writer changes centuries (if not his focus on homicide), returning to the mid-1800s to follow the exploits of Don Jaime Astarloa, the eponymous fencing master. <p> The year is 1866 and revolution is brewing in Spain. The corrupt Bourbon queen, Isabella II, is slowly losing her grip on power as equally corrupt exiled politicians vie to be her successor in a new republic. Against this background of political upheaval, Don Jaime goes about his business, teaching a dying art to a dwindling number of students. This is a man who resists changing times; to a friend he explains, "I have spent my whole life trying to preserve a certain idea of myself, and that is all. You have to cling to a set of values that do not depreciate with time. Everything else is the fashion of the moment, fleeting, mutable. In a word, nonsense." But then Adela de Otero--a woman with a mysterious past and an amazing talent for swordplay--comes into his life, and Don Jaime's world is turned upside down. As always, P�rez-Reverte offers literary excellence, a thumping good mystery, and fascinating insight into an arcane practice, in this case, fencing. Though the 19th-century politics in the book may resonate more with a Spanish audience than with English readers, the moral at the heart of <i>The Fencing Master</i> is universal: "to be honest, or at least honorable--anything, indeed, that has its roots in the word <i>honor</i>." In this, Don Jaime and Arturo P�rez-Reverte both succeed. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Published in paperback by Harcourt, 2000, 0-15-600684-7<br>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 1999, 0-15-100181-2<br></p><h2>A Superior Death</h2><p>While diving at her new station near Lake Superior, Park Ranger Anna Pigeon, last seen in Track of the Cat, discovers evidence of a grisly murder connected to an old sunken cargo ship.</p><p>Navada Barr is the award-winning author of seven Anna Pigeon mysteries: <i>Track of the Cat, A Superior Death, III Wind, Firestorm, Endangered Species, Blind Descent, and Liberty Falling.</i> She lives in Mississippi and was most recent a ranger on the Natchez Trace ParkwayIn her second appearance, after Track of the Cat , National Park Service ranger Anna Pigeon is posted to an island in Lake Superior, where her interest in wildlife is fully engaged by the local population of humans. Two scuba-diving tourists exploring an old, submerged wreck discover a recent addition: the body of Denny Castle, who ran a commercial diving concession in the park. This makes Anna uneasy about the mysterious disappearance of Donna Butkus, wife of fellow ranger Scotty Butkus. Hawk Bradshaw, who worked with Denny, suggests that there was a link between Denny and Donna, but Hawk is less revealing about the nature of the relationship he and his twin sister had with the dead man and the impact Denny's recent marriage (to yet another woman) had on it. The Bradshaws aren't the only reticent ones here; indeed, Barr's characters hide enough unsavory secrets to keep a soap opera humming for months. Despite the wealth of personal intrigue, FBI agent Frederic Stanton looks for a drug connection to the murder: "I'm all for drugs . . . Takes the guesswork out of law enforcement." The levelheaded Anna is again a treat as she and a couple of minor characters whose lives don't verge on melodrama keep the story from floundering on the rocks.

Yet most biographers pay little attention to people&#x2019;s attitudes toward food, as if the great and notable never bothered to think about what was on the plate in front of them. Once we ask how somebody relates to food, we find a whole world of different and provocative ways to understand her. Food stories can be as intimate and revealing as stories of love, work, or coming-of-age. Each of the six women in this entertaining group portrait was famous in her time, and most are still famous in ours; but until now, nobody has told their lives from the point of view of the kitchen and the table.&nbsp; <br><br><i>What She Ate</i> is a lively and unpredictable array of women; what they have in common with one another (and us) is a powerful relationship with food. They include Dorothy Wordsworth, whose food story transforms our picture of the life she shared with her famous poet brother; Rosa Lewis, the Edwardian-era Cockney caterer who cooked her way up the social ladder; Eleanor Roosevelt,&nbsp; First Lady and rigorous protector of the worst cook in White House history; Eva Braun, Hitler&#x2019;s mistress, who challenges our warm associations of food, family, and table; Barbara Pym, whose witty books upend a host of stereotypes about postwar British cuisine; and Helen Gurley Brown, the editor of <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, whose commitment to &#x201c;having it all&#x201d; meant having almost nothing on the plate except a supersized portion of diet gelatin.</p><p>Laura Shapiro has written on every food topic from champagne to Jell-O for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>Slate</i>, <i>Gourmet</i>, and many other publications. She is the author of three classic books of culinary history. Her awards include a James Beard Journalism Award and one from the National Women&#x2019;s Political Caucus. She&nbsp; has been a fellow at the Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library, where she also co-curated the widely acclaimed exhibition <i>Lunch Hour NYC</i>.Eleanor had never wanted to be First Lady. She hated the idea of surrendering her independence and pulling back from hands- on political work just to become a hostess. For the sake of the country she was glad FDR had been elected, but she knew exactly what First Ladies did: they got dressed up, they shook hands, and they made small talk, day after endless day. How could she submit to such a role? When FDR was nominated, she was the only person in the room who was stone- faced; and when he won, she wrote later, &#x201c;The turmoil in my heart and mind was rather great that night, and the next few months were not to make any clearer what the road ahead would be.&#x201d; As she was organizing the household for the move to Washington, she made a tentative suggestion to FDR: Wasn&#x2019;t there &#x201c;a real job&#x201d; she could do in the White House? Perhaps answer some of his mail? &#x201c;He looked at me quizzically and said he did not think that would do, that Missy, who had been handling his mail for a long time, would feel I was interfering. I knew he was right and that it would not work, but it was a last effort to keep in close touch and to feel that I had a real job to do.&#x201d; Eventually, of course, she created that job. She had seen how home economics operated: it was a woman&#x2019;s profession in a man&#x2019;s world. No lines were crossed, no fiefdoms challenged, but the women gave heart and soul to work they cared about. Now she, too, set out to find a professional place for herself, even while confined to FDR&#x2019;s sphere. She couldn&#x2019;t set policy, but she could travel, meet people, listen to them, investigate, pull myriad strings in Washington, make brilliant use of symbolic gestures, and give speeches that heartened the poor, the exploited, and the powerless. As Blanche Wiesen Cook put it, &#x201c;Her vision shaped the best of his&nbsp; presidency&#x201d;&#x2014;an assessment that would have been supported overwhelmingly by the millions of Americans whose lives she touched, though Eleanor herself would have briskly turned away any such compliment.<br><br>Her first responsibility was one that FDR asked her to take on: he wanted her to manage the domestic side of the White House&#x2014;a notion that must have reverberated in his mind for the next twelve years like a howl of triumph from Satan himself. Eleanor promptly set out to locate a first- rate housekeeper, someone who would plan and oversee the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and marketing for what was, in effect, a private hotel under public scrutiny. She thought she knew just the right person. Back in 1928, when FDR was running for governor of New York, Eleanor had become involved with the Hyde Park branch of the League of Women Voters and met a local woman who was also active in it: Henrietta Nesbitt, a homemaker with two grown sons and an unemployed husband. She was a strong supporter of FDR&#x2019;s and went to the same Episcopal church as Eleanor. And her family was hard up. Eleanor saw a way to help. She began hiring Mrs. Nesbitt to bake bread, pies, coffee cakes, and cookies for the constant entertaining that was going on at Hyde Park, and when the Roosevelts moved to Albany Mrs. Nesbitt kept right on baking for them, sending the orders upstate by train. Then FDR ran for president and won. Mrs. Nesbitt was delighted but also a little disappointed. The baking had been &#x201c;a godsend,&#x201d; as she wrote in her memoir, <i>White House Diary</i>. Now it was coming to an end, and the Nesbitts, who had been forced to move in with their son and his family, were going to lose their only source of income. But shortly after Thanksgiving, Mrs. Roosevelt stopped by and said she was going to need a housekeeper in the White House. At the time she wrote her memoir, Mrs. Nesbitt was aware that her tenure in the White House was likely to be remembered as a national embarrassment&#x2014;she had read all the bad press and heard all the complaints&#x2014;and in her book she made a point of quoting Eleanor&#x2019;s job offer very precisely: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want a professional housekeeper. I want someone I know. I want you, Mrs. Nesbitt.&#x201d;<br><br> It&#x2019;s not clear why Eleanor was so determined to hire an amateur for a job that called for supervising more than two dozen employees, maintaining sixty rooms and their furnishings, preparing meals for a guest list that often doubled or tripled on short notice, feeding sandwiches and sweets to a thousand or more at tea on any given day, and making sure family members and their innumerable overnight guests had everything they might require around the clock. Eleanor&#x2019;s contacts in Washington, not to mention her friends in home economics, could have given her the names of many candidates far more experienced than Mrs. Nesbitt. But Eleanor was comfortable with this Hyde Park woman, so loyal and accommodating, whose pies and cookies always arrived at the house when they were supposed to, and who very much needed the work. Why look elsewhere?<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs. Nesbitt didn&#x2019;t know beans about running a White House,&#x201d; recalled Lillian Rogers Parks, who worked as a maid and seamstress for the Hoovers, the Roosevelts, the Trumans, and the Eisenhowers. Known backstairs as &#x201c;Fluffy&#x201d;&#x2014;because she was so very much the opposite&#x2014;Mrs. Nesbitt had neither the skills nor the temperament for the immense job she had taken on, and she met the situation by becoming officious, overbearing, and peremptory. The staff loathed her. J. B. West, the longtime White House usher, said the mansion began looking &#x201c;dingy, almost seedy&#x201d; under her care, and the kitchen saw plate after plate coming back with gray slices of meat and pallid vegetables barely touched. The president complained steadily about the food, and by 1944 he was saying that the main reason he wanted to win a fourth term was for the pleasure of firing Mrs. Nesbitt. But to the end of Eleanor&#x2019;s life, she insisted she had made a good hire. &#x201c;Father never told me he wanted to get rid of Mrs. Nesbitt,&#x201d; she claimed in a letter to her son James, who had described in a memoir FDR&#x2019;s vehement feelings about the housekeeper. She added that FDR &#x201c;often praised&#x201d; Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s work&#x2014;an assertion so blatantly untrue that nobody took it seriously except Mrs. Nesbitt, who made the same claim in her own two books.<br><br>Yet Mrs. Nesbitt, the most reviled cook in presidential history, kept a careful record of the lunch and dinner menus she had planned at the White House and gave them to the Library of Congress with the rest of her papers. It&#x2019;s as if she wanted to announce to all future detractors that contrary to her reputation she had done a splendid job and fully deserved the faith that Eleanor had in her. Hence we have a comprehensive picture of what was served throughout FDR&#x2019;s administration&#x2014;not just the state dinners, which every administration publicized, but all the other meals as well. They make it clear, in fact they make it vivid, what everyone was so unhappy about.<br><br>Mrs. Nesbitt was under orders to practice strict economy, first because of the Depression and later because of wartime rationing. Beyond this, her only culinary vision was the one she had developed as a small- town home cook who occasionally ate out in modest restaurants. Eleanor looked over the menus every morning, but she was even less adventuresome than Mrs. Nesbitt when it came to feeding people and rarely asked for changes. Apart from this daily conference with the First Lady, Mrs. Nesbitt insisted on absolute control in the kitchen. &#x201c;Of course, Henrietta did not personally do the cooking, but she stood over the cooks, making sure that each dish was overcooked or undercooked or ruined one way or another,&#x201d; wrote Lillian Parks. Taste, texture, serving the food at the proper temperature, making sure each dish looked appetizing&#x2014;these were niceties that did not concern the housekeeper. For dinner she typically offered simple preparations of beef, lamb, chicken, and fish, though by the time they arrived at the table they tended to be cold and dried out. She also deployed an occasional novelty of the sort that appeared in women&#x2019;s magazines under such names as &#x201c;Seafood Surprise&#x201d; and &#x201c;Ham Hawaiian.&#x201d; Low- cost main dishes like sweetbreads, brains, and chicken livers appeared frequently, so frequently FDR took to complaining that he was never given anything else. But the greater cause for misery seems to have been lunch, which Mrs. Nesbitt saw as a fine occasion to save money. She built up a small repertoire of dishes based on leftovers and other inexpensive mixtures, and these turned up week after week as regularly as if they were on assignment. Sometimes these mixtures were stuffed into a green pepper, other times into a patty shell, but her favorite way to present them was the most straightforward&#x2014;on toast. There were curried eggs on toast, mushrooms and oysters on toast, broiled kidneys on toast, braised kidneys on toast, lamb kidneys on toast, chipped beef on toast, and a dish called &#x201c;Shrimp Wiggle,&#x201d; consisting of shrimp and canned peas heated in white sauce, on toast.<br><br>Another way to stretch just about any sort of food was to turn it into a creamed entr�e or side dish, so day after day the Roosevelts and their company encountered creamed codfish, creamed finnan haddie, creamed mushrooms, creamed carrots, creamed clams, creamed beef, and creamed sweetbreads. Egg dishes also appeared with some persistence: she offered stuffed eggs and shirred eggs, and she featured &#x201c;Eggs Benedictine&#x201d; until 1938, when somebody finally corrected her. Sometimes the menus make it clear that she was at wits&#x2019; end: we see her resorting to a dish she called &#x201c;Stuffed Egg Salad&#x201d; for two lunches in a row, and on another presumably frantic day it was sweet potatoes at both lunch and dinner. (She did vary them, adding marshmallows at lunch and pineapple at dinner.)<br><br>When it came to the salad course, Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s interpretation of the possibilities came from a long, uniquely American tradition in which any combination of foods, however unlikely, could be designated a salad simply by serving them on a lettuce leaf. &#x201c;We leaned on salads of every variety,&#x201d; she wrote in <i>The Presidential Cookbook,</i> her collection of White House recipes. &#x201c;Mrs. Roosevelt was especially fond of salads. . . .&nbsp; And even the men, who seemed inclined to frown on vegetables in any form, showed a definite interest in greens when they were fixed in appetizing ways with a tangy dressing.&#x201d; How the men reacted to &#x201c;Jellied Bouillon Salad&#x201d; is not recorded. Other salads that appeared on the White House table, and these must have made quite an impression on foreign visitors unfamiliar with the tradition, included &#x201c;Stuffed Prune Salad,&#x201d; &#x201c;Ashville Salad&#x201d; (canned tomato soup in a gelatin ring mold), and &#x201c;Pear Salad,&#x201d; a hot- weather specialty featuring canned pears covered in cream cheese, mayonnaise, chives, and candied ginger. Mrs. Nesbitt said she sometimes colored the mayonnaise green.<br><br>Many of these dishes reflected the American eating habits of her time; others would have been extreme under any circumstances. Not many families began dinner with sticks of fresh pineapple that had been rolled in crushed peppermint candy. But on the whole, Mrs. Nesbitt was setting a familiar if dowdy table, a culinary standard that suited Eleanor very well. She was emphatic about promoting simple, mainstream cuisine as a Roosevelt administration virtue. &#x201c;I am doing away with all the kickshaws&#x2014;no hothouse grapes&#x2014;nothing out of season,&#x201d; she told <i>The New York Times</i>. &#x201c;I plan for good and well- cooked food and see that it is properly served, and that must be enough.&#x201d; And perhaps it would have been, if Mrs. Nesbitt had been able to bring the right instincts or training to her work. She had little of either to draw upon. The arrival of foreign visitors was especially challenging, though she liked to think of herself as rising to the occasion. &#x201c;For Chinese people I&#x2019;d always try for a bland menu,&#x201d; she explained in <i>White House Diary</i>. &#x201c;Then for the Mexican dinner I&#x2019;d have something hot, like Spanish sauce with the chicken.&#x201d; She was especially proud of the nondairy, vegetarian menu she was able to create for the ambassador from Abyssinia and his entourage, who were Coptic Christians, and she carefully kept it on file to reuse when she had to feed Hindus or Muslims. Those who couldn&#x2019;t eat the clam cocktail or the bluefish presumably filled up on the Mexican corn.<br><br>A few of the meals in Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s collection are marked &#x201c;Mrs. Hibben&#x2019;s menu,&#x201d; a reference to a rare dalliance with gourmandise that took place early in the first administration. After the election, Eleanor received a memo from Ernestine Evans, a former journalist and peripatetic literary agent who took an interest in food and thought it could play a useful role in the new White House. Why not showcase American cooking? Menus could include fine regional dishes&#x2014;&#x201c;cornbreads and gumbos and chowders&#x201d;&#x2014;authentically prepared with local ingredients. Just as the White House regularly supplied the press with the names of the guests at official dinners, it could also supply the menus; and a commitment to focus on America&#x2019;s culinary traditions would assure positive news coverage. Evans said she had the right person in mind to help make this happen: Sheila Hibben, author of <i>The National Cookbook</i> and &#x201c;the best practical cook I know.&#x201d; Perhaps Hibben could work quietly behind the scenes in the White House kitchen for a few months, developing appropriate menus and recipes. &#x201c;She should be used like a good architect,&#x201d; Evans mused. &#x201c;She should go back and find out what Jefferson served, and be ready always with a great deal of lore, so that every dish has history as well as savor.&#x201d;<br><br>Sheila Hibben was a witty, cosmopolitan food writer who contributed regularly to <i>The New Yorker</i> and other chic magazines. In the introduction to <i>The National Cookbook,</i> she wrote that she had been inspired to start collecting regional American recipes the day she came across a picture in the Sunday paper of a bowl of soup topped with whipped cream&#x2014;whipped cream, that is, in the shape of a Sealyham terrier. Off she went on a mission to rescue what was still excellent in American cooking, hoping the best recipes would act as a kind of seawall to protect fine regional cookery against crashing waves of the idiotic, the reductionist, and the dreary. A project that began with indignation, she added, ended in patriotism&#x2014;&#x201c;a special sort of patriotism, a real enthusiasm for the riches and traditions of America.&#x201d; Eleanor liked the idea of food that could teach history, and she invited Hibben to visit the White House kitchen and share her ideas and recipes with Mrs. Nesbitt. Alas, there seems to be no record of precisely what happened when Mrs. Nesbitt met this particular challenge to her authority, but in the end, victory went to the housekeeper.<br><br>Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s most important adversary, however, wasn&#x2019;t in the kitchen; he was in the Oval Office. She and FDR were at odds from the start. &#x201c;Father, who would have been an epicure if he had been given the opportunity, began grumbling about the meals served under Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s supervision within a week of her reporting for duty,&#x201d; wrote his son Elliott in a memoir. &#x201c;Restricted in his wheelchair from dining out except on ceremonial occasions, he was at the mercy of Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s kitchen.&#x201d; FDR liked a decent fried egg in the morning; Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s were invariably overcooked. He longed for a good cup of coffee; Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s was bitter.

Saladin grants Ibn Yakub permission to talk to his wife and retainers so that he might present a full portrait in the Sultan&#x2019;s memoirs. A series of interconnected stories follows, tales brimming over with warmth, earthy humor and passions in which ideals clash with realities and dreams are confounded by desires. <br><br>At the heart of the novel is an affecting love affair between the Sultan&#x2019;s favored wife, Jamila, and the beautiful Halina, a later addition to the harem. The novel charts the rise of Saladin as Sultan of Egypt and Syria and follows him as he prepares, in alliance with his Jewish and Christian subjects, to take Jerusalem back from the Crusaders. This is a medieval story, but much of it will be uncannily familiar to those who follow events in contemporary Cairo, Damascus, and Baghdad. Betrayed hopes, disillusioned soldiers and unrealistic alliances form the backdrop to <i>The Book of Saladin</i>.</p><p>Tariq Ali has been a British national treasure for almost five decades. Revolutionary, writer, broadcaster, filmmaker, polemicist--fighter in the street--and general all-round trouble-maker (in the nicest possible sense), he's been them all, and usually at the same time. Since 1990 Ali has also worked in fiction, firstly with <i>Redemption</i>, and now with a planned quartet of historical novels, of which <i>The Book of Saladin</i> is the second. (The first was the award-winning <i>Shadows of the Pomegranate Tree</i>.) <p> Ali's passion for life, and his humor, are found all over this latest work, which is set in the 12th century--with eerily prescient echoes of modern times. It shows us the conflict between Christian and Islamic civilizations set to a sometimes bawdy, sometimes brutal background where all of life is in flux. As in his previous novel, Ali shows the depth and breadth of his learning and humanity on every page. Like his central character, Saladin, or Salah-al-Din (the Kurdish liberator of Jerusalem), he has been a fighter of many causes, a maker of alliances, who has made an impact on the world around him. Unlike his hero, Tariq Ali has never been a Sultan, or a warrior, except a class one, of course. But between them--Ali and his warrior king--readers can discover much of both history and contemporary life in the melting pot of world religion. <i>--Robin Hunt, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><b>Tariq Ali</b> is a writer and filmmaker.

Among his most recent are the <em>Dark Tower</em> novels,<em> Cell</em>, <em>From a Buick 8</em>, <em>Everything's Eventual</em>, <em>Hearts in Atlantis</em>, <em>The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon</em>, and <em>Bag of Bones</em>. He is the recipient of the 2003 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. He lives in Bangor, Maine, with his wife, novelist Tabitha King. </strong></p> <strong> </strong> <p><em>The Strain</em> trilogy opened with an authentic wow moment: a Boeing 777 arrives at JFK airport with all but four of the passengers dead in their seats. The flashlight beams of the first responders &#x201c;registered dully in the dead jewels of their open eyes.&#x201d; Not much later these corpses begin to rise from their morgue slabs, and a plague of blood-hungry predators overwhelms New York. The first hundred pages of <em>The Strain</em> is a sustained exercise in terror that held this reader in spellbound delight, because del Toro and Hogan write with crisp authenticity about both the fantastical (vampires) and the completely real (New York City, with all its odd nooks and crannies).</p> <p>What began in <em>The Strain</em> comes to a sublimely satisfying conclusion in <em>The Night Eternal</em>. Del Toro and Hogan have taken Dracula, the greatest vampire tale of them all, and deftly turned it inside out. In Stoker&#x2019;s novel, Bloodsucker Zero arrives in England on a sailing ship called the Demeter. As with the Regis Air 777, the Demeter is a ghost ship when it reaches port, the eponymous Count having snacked his way across the ocean. The difference is that Dracula is confronted by a heroic band of vampire-hunters who eventually drive him from England by using modern technology&#x2014;everything from diaries kept on wax recording cylinders to blood transfusions. In <em>The Strain</em> Trilogy, the body-hopping Master&#x2014;who arrives at JFK in the person of Polish nobleman Jusef Sardu&#x2014;uses the very technology that defeated his honorable forebear to destroy the civilized world. Big corporations are his tools; modern transportation serves to spread the vampire virus; nuclear weapons usher in a new era of pollution and atmospheric darkness.</p> <p>Only jolly old England escapes; the wily Brits have blown up the Chunnel early on, and remain relatively vampire-free. At moments like this, the reader senses del Toro and Hogan tucking their tongues in their cheeks and having a gleeful blast.</p> <p>When speaking of the New World Order in Henry the Sixth, Shakespeare has one of his characters say, &#x201c;The first thing we do, let&#x2019;s kill all the lawyers.&#x201d; As The <em>Night Eternal</em> opens, the Master (currently having traded the body of Sardu for that of rock star Gabriel Bolivar) doubles down on that, ordering his minions to kill not just those in the legal profession but all the CEOs, tycoons, intellectuals, rebels, and artists. &#x201c;Their execution was swift, public and brutal. Out they marched, the damned, out of the River House, the Dakota, the Beresford and their ilk...in a horrific pageant of carnage, they were disposed of.&#x201d;</p> <p>With the exception of heroic pawnbroker/scholar Abraham Setrakian (who almost destroyed the Master in Volume Two, <em>The Fall</em>), the winning cast of human characters from the previous novels are all present and accounted for: Nora Martinez, who has traded in her scientist&#x2019;s microscope for a silver sword; Vasily Fet, who now exterminates vampires instead of rats; Augustin &#x201c;Gus&#x201d; Elizade, once a gangbanger and now a hero of resistance. There&#x2019;s also the less-than-admirable but fascinating (in a repulsive way, it&#x2019;s true) Alfonso Creem, with his insatiable appetite and his vampire-repelling mouthful of silver teeth.</p> <p>And there&#x2019;s Eph Goodweather, the epidemiologist around whom all these others revolve. When <em>The Night Eternal</em> begins, two years after the Master has used nuclear weapons to create vampire-friendly darkness all over the planet, Eph has fallen on hard times. His undead ex-wife stalks him relentlessly (he is, after all, one of her &#x201c;Dear Ones&#x201d;), his son has become a rifle-toting, obsessive-compulsive acolyte of the Master, and Eph himself has started popping Vicodin and oxycodone. Nora has left him for Vasily Fet, and Eph is viewed with distrust by those who used to rally around him. Justifiable distrust; he keeps showing up late for meetings and vampire-killing gigs.</p> <p>Fet has managed to purchase a rogue nuke (it&#x2019;s wrapped in garbage bags and looks like a trashcan), and the resistance fighters have a sacred book that may&#x2014;if deciphered&#x2014;lead them to the Black Site where the Master&#x2019;s earthly life began. If they can destroy that holy soil, they believe the vampire plague will end.</p> <p>There&#x2019;s a certain amount of perhaps dispensable hugger-mugger about vampires in Rome and archangels in Sodom, but the main attractions here are the resistance fighters&#x2019; fierce dedication to their cause, and Eph Goodweather&#x2019;s slow and painful realization that if he destroys the Master, he may also destroy his son Zachary, the last person on earth he truly loves. Heroes of tragic dimension are rare in popular fiction, but Goodweather fills the bill nicely.</p> <p>After a small (and perhaps unavoidable&#x2014;see Tolkein&#x2019;s The Two Towers) letdown in <em>The Fall</em>, <em>The Strain</em> Trilogy comes to a rip-roaring conclusion in <em>The Night Eternal</em>. The action is non-stop, and the fantasy element is anchored in enough satisfying detail to make it believable. All the New York landmarks, such as Central Park&#x2019;s Belvedere Castle and The Cloisters, are real. And while you&#x2019;re discovering such essential vampire facts as the undead&#x2019;s inability to cross running water without human help, you&#x2019;ll also find out that the stone lions outside the New York Public Library have names: Patience and Fortitude. Plus, come on, admit it&#x2014;there&#x2019;s something about seeing vampires massing for an attack in a Wendy&#x2019;s parking lot that makes them more real. The devil&#x2019;s in the details, and this is one devilishly good read full of satisfying scares. --<em>Stephen King</em><br></p><p>From the authors of the instant<em>New York Times</em> bestsellers<em>The Strain</em> and <em>The Fall</em> comesthe final volume in one of the mostelectrifying thriller series in years</p><p>It&#x2019;s been two years since the vampiric virus was unleashed in <em>The Strain</em>, and the entire world now lies on the brink of annihilation.

He was educated in the local schools and at the University of Georgia, where he graduated with a BA degree in 1959. He served in the United States Air Force, in which he says he "...flew a truck," as an enlisted man during the Berlin Wall crisis of 1961-62.<p></p><p>He devoted his early adult years to a career in advertising , as an award-winning writer for agencies in New York and London. It was while living in London in 1973 that he decided to pursue an ambition held since childhood, to write fiction. he moved to a flat in the stable yard of a castle in south County Galway, Ireland, and while working two days a week for a Dublin ad agency to support himself, began work on a novel. Shortly after beginning, he discovered sailing and , as he puts it, "Everything went to hell." The novel was put temporarily aside while he spent all his time, "...racing an eleven foot plywood dinghy against small children, losing regularly."</p><p></p><p>In the autumn of 1974, a friend invited him to help ferry a small yacht up the west coast of Ireland, and the bug bit even harder. Shortly thereafter, his grandfather died, leaving him "...just enough money to get into debt for a boat," and he immediately decided to go to the 1976 Observer Single-handed Transatlantic Race (OSTAR). He moved to a gamekeeper's cottage on a river above Cork Harbour and had a boat built at a nearby boatyard. He studied navigation and sailed on other people's boats every chance he got, then, after completing a 1300-mile qualifying voyage from the Azores to Ireland, he persuaded the Race Committee to accept him as an Irish entry.</p><p></p><p>He completed the race in good form, taking forty-five days, and in 1977 his memoir of the Irish period, <i>Blue Water, Green Skipper</i> was published in London and New York. While sporadically working on the novel, he completed another book, <i>A Romantic's Guide to the Country Inns of Britain and Ireland,</i> published in 1979.</p><p><i>Chiefs</i>, Woods' long-awaited novel, was published in 1981 to wide critical and popular acclaim, garnering excellent reviews and winning the Edgar Allan Poe Award. <i>Chiefs</i> was filmed for television as a six-hour drama starring Charlton Heston.

It had begun after a phone conversation early in the previous winter. The call, from Arrington Carter, had ended everything. Now she was the wife of another man, living in his house, rearing his son. He would never see her again, except in her husband's company, and he would never think of her again without feeling the pain. </p><p>He had never believed it would persist into the following spring, but it had. If anything, it was worse. He saw Dino a couple of times a week, always at Elaine's. Dino was his closest friend--sometimes, he felt, his only friend. Not true, of course. Elaine was his friend, and the evenings in her restaurant, with Elaine and Dino, were the only bright spots in his week. His law practice had lately been boring, a personal injury suit that dragged on and on, a bone thrown to him by Woodman &amp; Weld, because there wasn't enough meat on it to nourish a firm with thirty partners and a hundred associates. They were ready to go to trial, and the expected settlement offer had not materialized. It was depressing. Everything was depressing. And the pain continued, assuaged only by bourbon, and he had done too much assuaging lately. He sat at table number five, at Elaine's, with Dino, and ordered another assuagement. </p><p>"Let's go to a party," Dino said. "Have your next one there." </p><p>"I don't feel like going to a party with a lot of cops," Stone said. </p><p>"It's not a cop party." </p><p>"You don't know anybody but cops," Stone said. </p><p>Dino caught the waiter's eye and signaled for a check. "I know lots of people," he said. </p><p>"Name three who aren't cops or Mafiosi." </p><p>"It's not a Mafia party, either," Dino said, dodging the question. </p><p>"Whose party is it?" </p><p>"It's at a deputy DA's." </p><p>"Oh. Then we get to bring our own booze." </p><p>"His name is Martin B-r-o-u-g-h-a-m," he spelled, "pronounced 'Broom,' and he's got some money, I think." </p><p>"Isn't he handling the Dante trial?" Dante was a crime boss, and his trial was the most important since Gotti's. </p><p>"He got a conviction this afternoon." </p><p>"I hadn't heard." </p><p>"Don't you watch the news anymore?" </p><p>"Not much." </p><p>"The party is to celebrate the conviction." </p><p>"How come I don't know Brougham?" </p><p>"Because he runs with a classier crowd than you're accustomed to. The only seedy lawyers he meets are in court." </p><p>"Who are you calling a seedy lawyer?" </p><p>"How many lawyers are at this table?" </p><p>"I am not a seedy lawyer; I just take seedy cases. There's a difference." </p><p>"Whatever you say," Dino said, standing up and reaching for his raincoat. "Let's get out of here." </p><p>"I don't want to," Stone grumbled. </p><p>"You don't want to do anything, you desolate fuck, and I can't stand it anymore. Now put your coat on and come with me, or I'll just shoot you here and now. Nobody would ever prosecute me; it would be justifiable homicide." </p><p>"Oh, all right," Stone said, struggling to his feet and grabbing his coat. "One drink, if the guy serves decent booze. Then I'm out of there." </p><p></p><p>The apartment was a duplex in the East Sixties, definitely not the preserve of an assistant DA. </p><p>"You're right," Stone said, as they handed their coats to a maid. "He's got money. There's at least a million dollars of art hanging in this room." </p><p>"What are you, his insurance agent?" Dino whispered. "Try and have a good time, okay?" </p><p>"Tell me more about this guy," Stone said. </p><p>"Word is, he's up for chief deputy DA, and he's going to run for DA, if the old man ever retires." </p><p>"He'll grow old waiting," Stone said. </p><p>A handsome man of about forty spotted Dino and came across the room, towing a tall blond woman in a Chanel suit. </p><p>"Dino," he said, shaking hands. "I'm glad you could make it. You remember Dana." </p><p>The woman shook Dino's hand. "Who's this?" she asked, turning her gaze on Stone. </p><p>"This is Stone Barrington, Dana. Stone, this is Martin and Dana Brougham." </p><p>"How do you do?" Stone said mechanically, shaking their hands. </p><p>"I've heard of you," Brougham said, steering Stone and Dino toward the bar. "You were Dino's partner at the Nineteenth Precinct a while back, weren't you?" </p><p>"A while back," Stone echoed. "After I left the force they had to kick him upstairs; nobody else would ride in the same car with him." </p><p>"You're over at Woodman and Weld, aren't you?" </p><p>"I'm of counsel, to them," Stone replied, "but Woodman and Weld would probably rather you didn't know it." It was a remark he wouldn't have made if he had been entirely sober. </p><p>Brougham laughed. "What are you drinking?" </p><p>"Wild Turkey on the rocks, if you have it." </p><p>Brougham grabbed a bottle that looked like a crystal decanter and poured Stone a double. "This is Wild Turkey, but it's got a leg up on the standard stuff." </p><p>Stone tasted the whiskey. The man was right. This stuff cost thirty bucks a bottle; he was beginning to like Brougham. </p><p>A couple arrived at the front door, and Brougham went off to greet them. "Wander around," he said. "Meet some people." </p><p>Stone looked around. The room was jammed with people, and somebody was playing the piano rather well. "I see at least four cops," he said to Dino. </p><p></p></p><h2>Organon of the Medical Art</h2><p>Based on treating the whole patient rather than isolated symptoms, homeopathy uses minute doses of naturally derived medicine to stimulate the patient&#x2019;s own life force. Physician Samuel Hahnemann&#x2019;s pioneering text Organon of the Medical Art, first published in 1810, remains the foundation for all study in this field. Wenda O&#x2019;Reilly worked with translator Stephen Decker to produce a version of the book that would preserve Hahnemann&#x2019;s insights while adapting it to the needs of the modern general reader. The book is restructured as a series of chapters and sections, and newly added side notes and footnotes, a contextual glossary, and an index vastly increase the book&#x2019;s usefulness.</p><p>Conventional Western medicine, working from an allopathic basis, attempts to cure disease by opposing and suppressing its most obvious symptoms. Homeopathic medicine, however, treats the whole patient rather than isolated symptoms. Minute doses of medicines are used to combat disease by stimulating the patient's own life force. <p>Samuel Hahnemann, the visionary 19th centure physician who founded this system of treatment, distilled his philosophy and practice into The Organon of the Medical Art. Long recognized as one of the most important books ever written on the subject of health, disease, and medical care, the Organon has for many years been required reading for all serious students of homeopathy. </p><p>The wisdom of this seminal work is available to contemporary readers as never before, in an English version edited and annotated by Wenda Brewster O'Reilly, based on a definitive new translation by Steven Decker. </p><p>O'Reilly has produced a version of the Organon that is faithful to the nuances of Hahnemann's thought yet infinitely more accessible to contemporary readers than were previous edition. She has applied a system of chapters and sections to Hahnemann's text of numbered paragraphs, and her sidenotes, editor's footnotes, and glossary provide the context necessary for a true understanding of the author's meaning. Finally, the inclusion of an index vastly increases the volume's effectiveness as a reference tool. </p><p>With the publication of this new edition, the genius of Samuel Hahnemann is brought to light.

And considering daily news reports, it often seems his plan is succeeding. It is in this climate that Francis Frangipane calls believers to awaken as if from a stupor. The church must, he states, overcome weariness and indifference, strategize for war, and scatter wickedness like dust! This fervent, biblical exhortation to defeat evil will appeal to spiritual warriors, intercessors, the prophetically gifted, and anyone who feels overwhelmed by sin and current events. Here is indispensable insight for transforming the temporal with the power of the eternal.</p><p>In this day of advancing evil, will the Church wake up and fight? There is an enemy at our gates. Though you may be aware of Satan&#39;s assault, are you praying with authority against him? If not, it is probably because Satan&#39;s first line of attack is often a spirit of heaviness, which renders Christians passive and, thus, defenseless against the unfolding battle. Indeed, if you aren&#39;t praying against the enemy, he is probably stealing something precious from you-and it may be the heart of a loved one, the future of your church or the destiny of our nation. Author Francis Frangipane tells us that the call of God is a call to war. As we stand at the cusp of a major spiritual awakening in our land, the Holy Spirit is ready to impart a fresh anointing to God&#39;s people-an anointing that will activate the &#34;war mode&#34; in your heart. Ours is not a time of peace or surrender. No, this day we fight!

This distinctively drawn work chronicles the rise and reign of Chairman Mao Zedong, and his sweeping, often cataclysmic vision for the most populated country on the planet.<br>Though the storyline is epic, the storytelling is intimate, reflecting the real life of the book&#x2019;s artist. Li Kunwu spent more than 30 years as a state artist for the Communist Party. He saw firsthand what was happening to his family, his neighbors, and his homeland during this extraordinary time. Working with Philippe �ti�, the artist has created a memoir of self and state, a rich, very human account of a major historical moment with contemporary consequences.

Li was a youngster in the late 1950s when his country embarked on the Great Leap Forward, resulting in millions dying of starvation, followed by the Cultural Revolution, when millions more were persecuted, imprisoned, relocated, or, like Li&#x2019;s father, sent away for reeducation. The deprivations the nation faced during those turbulent two decades make China&#x2019;s subsequent turn to unfettered capitalism&#x2014;which Li depicts in all its crass rapaciousness&#x2014;all the more remarkable. Motivated by the twisted patriotism that gripped the nation, Li joined the military, which led to his becoming a government propaganda artist and then cartoonist for a provincial party newspaper. His engrossing, affecting chronicle introduces the West to a masterful graphic storyteller; his expressive drawings and command of narrative effectively and movingly convey this extraordinary epoch. Much has been written about China&#x2019;s devastating postwar era and its recent modernization, but the vividness of the comics medium, especially in the hands of as skilled a practitioner as Li, gives this rendition a unique power. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>Thunder Bunny</h2><p>Despite being the smallest of the bunch, Thunder Bunny discovers her true identity in the world through a courageous act and determined spirit that is appreciated by all, in a touching tale with poetic verse by the creator of Grandfather Twilight.</p><p>Barbara Helen Berger lives on Bainbridge Island, Washington.</p><h2>Modern Classics Handful of Dust (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>Taking its title from T.S. Eliot&#39;s modernist poem The Waste Land, Evelyn Waugh&#39;s A Handful of Dust is a chronicle of Britain&#39;s decadence and social disintegration between the First and Second World Wars. This Penguin Modern Classics edition is edited with an introduction and notes by Robert Murray Davis. After seven years of marriage, the beautiful Lady Brenda Last is bored with life at Hetton Abbey, the Gothic mansion that is the pride and joy of her husband, Tony. She drifts into an affair with the shallow socialite John Beaver and forsakes Tony for the Belgravia set. Brilliantly combining tragedy, comedy and savage irony, A Handful of Dust captures the irresponsible mood of the &#39;crazy and sterile generation&#39; between the wars. This breakdown of the Last marriage is a painful, comic re-working of Waugh&#39;s own divorce, and a symbol of the disintegration of society. If you enjouyed A Handful of Dust, you might like Waugh&#39;s Vile Bodies, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;One of the twentieth century&#39;s most chilling and bitter novels; and one of its best&#39; Nicholas Lezard, Guardian &#39;One of the most distinguished novels of the century&#39; Frank Kermode &#39;This is a masterpiece of stylish satire, and is funny, too ... a marvellous book&#39; John Banville, Irish Times</p><p><i>"All over England people were waking up, queasy and despondent."</i><p> Few writers have walked the line between farce and tragedy as nimbly as Evelyn Waugh, who employed the conventions of the comic novel to chip away at the already crumbling English class system. His 1934 novel, <i>A Handful of Dust</i>, is a sublime example of his bleak satirical style: a mordantly funny expos� of aristocratic decadence and ennui in England between the wars.</p><p> Tony Last is an aristocrat whose attachment to an ideal feudal past is so profound that he is blind to his wife Brenda's boredom with the stately rhythms of country life. While he earnestly plays the lord of the manor in his ghastly Victorian Gothic pile, she sets herself up in a London flat and pursues an affair with the social-climbing idler John Beaver. In the first half of the novel Waugh fearlessly anatomizes the lifestyles of the rich and shameless. Everyone moves through an endless cycle of parties and country-house weekends, being scrupulously polite in public and utterly horrid in private. Sex is something one does to relieve the boredom, and Brenda's affair provides a welcome subject for conversation: </p><blockquote> It had been an autumn of very sparse and meagre romance; only the most obvious people had parted or come together, and Brenda was filling a want long felt by those whose simple, vicarious pleasure it was to discuss the subject in bed over the telephone. </blockquote> Tony's indifference and Brenda's selfishness give their relationship a sort of equilibrium until tragedy forces them to face facts. The collapse of their relationship accelerates, and in the famous final section of the book Tony seeks solace in a foolhardy search for El Dorado, throwing himself on the mercy of a jungle only slightly more savage than the one he leaves behind in England. For all its biting wit, <i>A Handful of Dust</i> paints a bleak picture of the English upper classes, reaching beyond satire toward a very modern sense of despair. In Waugh's world, culture, breeding, and the trappings of civilization only provide more subtle means of destruction. <i>--Simon Leake</i>8 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Fix-It &amp; Forget-It Lightly: Healthy Low-Fat Recipes for Your Slow Cooker</h2><p>Yes, Now you can have it all: Food from your slow cooker that is scrumptious, quick and easy to prepare and low fat!</p><p><p>By New York Times bestselling author Phyllis Pellman Good<br><br> This volume in the best-selling Fix-It and Forget-It tradition gives you more than 500 new and revised recipes that are mouth-watering but guilt-free.

Instead of fading, the shimmering charge split in two and the twin streams of plasma began to circle their respective pillars. They moved like flames chasing the wind, racing around the columns and snaking their way upward toward the underside of a curved, metallic dome. There, they swirled together like the arms of a spiral galaxy, joining each other once again before vanishing in a final, eye-searing flash.</p><p>Darkness followed.</p><p>Ozone lingered in the air.</p><p>On the floor of the cavern, a group of men and women stood motionless, night-blind from the display. The flash had been impressive, but they&#x2019;d all seen electricity before. Every one of them expected something more. </p><p>&#x201c;Is that it?&#x201d; a gruff voice asked.</p><p>The words came from Brigadier General Hal Cortland, a burly, squat figure of a man. They were directed at thirty-eight-year-old Daniel Watterson, a slight, blond-haired man wearing spectacles who stood by the controls of the great machine from which the artificial lightning had come.</p><p>Watterson studied a bank of dimly lit gauges. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not actually sure,&#x201d; he whispered to himself. No one had ever gotten this far, not even Michael Faraday or the great Nikola Tesla. But if Watterson was right&#x2014;if his calculations and his theory and years of serving as Tesla&#x2019;s apprentice had led him to understand what was about to occur&#x2014;then the display of light they&#x2019;d just witnessed should be only the beginning.</p><p>He switched off the main power, stepped away from the controls, and pulled the wire-rimmed glasses from his face. Despite the darkness, he could make out a soft blue glow coming from the columns. He raised his eyes to the dome above. An effervescent hue could be seen coursing around its inner surface.</p><p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; Cortland demanded.</p><p>Back at the console, one of the needles ticked up. Watterson saw it from the corner of his eye.</p><p>&#x201c;No, General,&#x201d; he said quietly, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s quite finished.&#x201d;</p><p>As Watterson spoke, a low rumble made its way through the cave. It sounded like heavy stones tumbling in some distant quarry, muffled and distorted, as if the vibration had to traverse miles of solid rock just to reach them. It rose for several seconds, then faded and ceased.</p><p>The general began to snicker. He switched on a flashlight. &#x201c;Uncle Sam ain&#x2019;t paying for a show with wet fireworks, son.&#x201d;</p><p>Watterson didn&#x2019;t reply. He was listening, feeling for something, for anything, at this point.</p><p>The general seemed to give up. &#x201c;Come on, people,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;the party&#x2019;s over. Let&#x2019;s get out of this mole hole.&#x201d;</p><p>The group began to move. Their shuffling and mumbling made it impossible to hear.</p><p>Watterson raised a hand. &#x201c;Please!&#x201d; he called out loudly. &#x201c;Everyone, stay where you are!&#x201d;</p><p>The observers stopped in their tracks, and Watterson edged over to where the steel columns penetrated the rock floor. From there, they descended another five hundred feet &#x201c;to get a firm<i> </i>grip on the Earth,&#x201d; as Tesla once put it.</p><p>Laying a hand on one of the columns, Watterson felt a cold vibration. It surged through his body as if he&#x2019;d become a part of the circuit. It wasn&#x2019;t painful like electricity and didn&#x2019;t make his muscles spasm, nor did it find its way to the ground and electrocute him. It was almost soothing, leaving him slightly dizzy, even a bit euphoric.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming,&#x201d; he whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s coming?&#x201d; the general asked.</p><p>Watterson looked back. &#x201c;The return.&#x201d;</p><p>Cortland waited a few seconds before scowling. &#x201c;You scientists are like barkers at a carnival: you think if you say something loud enough, and often enough, the rest of us will begin to believe it. But I don&#x2019;t hear any&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The general swallowed his words as the deep rumble made a second appearance. It surged through the cavern more emphatically this time, and the blue glow around the towers intensified, pulsing and matching the sound waves identically.</p><p>This time, when the waves faded, everyone held still. They were waiting for more. Forty seconds later they were rewarded. A third wave came through like a freight train passing by. It shook the cave underfoot and brought the swirl of lightning back to the polished surface of the dome above. The visible spiral of energy began descending the pillars, making it halfway down to the ground before vanishing.</p><p>Watterson pulled back, stepping away from the danger zone.</p><p>Moments later, a fourth reverberation surged into the cavern. The columns flared as it hit. Flashes of light jumped back and forth between them. The cavern began shaking. Dust and tiny bits of stone rained down from above, sending the witnesses scurrying for cover.</p><p>Watterson caught sight of General Cortland bathed in the light and grinning manically. Their roles had reversed. Now it was Cortland looking satisfied as Watterson began to worry. The scientist stepped toward the panel, slid his glasses back on, and studied the display. He couldn&#x2019;t account for the vibration.</p><p>Before he could determine anything, a fifth wave hit. The vibration and the artificial lightning grew so intense, even the general seemed to realize something was wrong. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d;</p><p>Watterson could barely hear him, but he was wondering the same thing. The power gauges&#x2014;all but dead moments before&#x2014;were heading toward their redlines.</p><p>A brief respite gave way to a sixth harmonic return, and the needles went off the scales. The shuddering was unbearable. Rocks were falling from above. A huge crack began to zigzag its way across the reinforced wall of the cave where the army had poured concrete to shore it up. Watterson had to grip the panel to stop from falling down.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d; the general repeated. Watterson wasn&#x2019;t sure, but it couldn&#x2019;t be good.</p><p>&#x201c;Get everybody out of here,&#x201d; he yelled. &#x201c;Get them out&#x2014;now!&#x201d;</p><p>The general pointed toward the cagelike elevator that would take them four hundred feet to the surface. The group ran for it like a stampeding herd. But the tremors intensified and the far wall gave way before they could climb inside.</p><p>A thousand tons of rock and concrete plunged down on them. Those too close were crushed instantly. Others scrambled away just in time as the scaffolding-like frame of the elevator was bent and shoved aside.</p><p>Watterson began to panic. His hands flew back and forth across the controls, flicking switches and tapping gauges. The vibration was constant. The sound deafening.</p><p>Cortland grabbed him by the shoulder. &#x201c;Turn it off!&#x201d;</p><p>Watterson ignored him. He was trying to understand.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you hear me?!&#x201d; the general shouted. <i>&#x201c;Turn the damned thing off!&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x201c;It is off!&#x201d; Watterson shouted, pulling free of the general&#x2019;s grasp.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been off since after the first spark,&#x201d; Watterson explained.</p><p>The latest wave faded, but on the panel he could see the next wave building. The needles went off the scale and Watterson&#x2019;s face went white. Each wave had been bigger than the last. He feared to imagine what kind of power was on its way.</p><p>&#x201c;Then where&#x2019;s the energy coming from?&#x201d; Cortland demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;From everywhere,&#x201d; Watterson said. &#x201c;From all around us. That&#x2019;s what the experiment was supposed to prove.&#x201d;</p><p>The cavern began to shake once again. This time the lightning was not contained on the columns, it jumped around the room, flying into the walls, the ceiling, and the floor. Shards of stone and clouds of dust blasted out into the open space.</p><p>Amid the screams and panic, Watterson stood helpless, his moment of victory fading to utter catastrophe. From above him came the ominous sound of cracking. </p><p>With the cave shaking so badly they could barely stand, both Watterson and the general looked up. A dark fissure snaked across the ceiling. It went from wall to wall and then spidered in different directions. </p><p>The ceiling collapsed all at once and a million tons of rock dropped toward them. </p><p>Death came instantly, and neither Watterson nor General Cortland would ever know the fury they&#x2019;d unleashed or the utter devastation that the ensuing earthquake caused in the city of San Francisco.</p><p></p><p></p><p>December 2009</p><p>In the midst of a growing tempest, Patrick Devlin stood on the aft deck of the <i>Java Dawn</i>, an oceangoing tug linked by a single massive cable to the rusting hulk of a cruise ship known as the <i>Pacific Voyager</i>.</p><p>Huge swells came at the tug sideways, slamming against the hull with the sound of a shotgun blast. The rain fell in diagonal sheets, though it was hard to distinguish from the wind-whipped spray.</p><p>Surrounded by towing and loading equipment, including a fifty-foot crane and a powerful winch array, Devlin looked positively small. In truth, he stood nearly six feet tall, with broad shoulders that were hunched against the cold.</p><p>With gray stubble on his cheeks and folds of burnished flesh hooding his eyes, Devlin appeared every bit the wizened old sailor he was. Taking stock of the deteriorating weather, the increasing strain on the cable, and the condition of the sea, he came to a grave conclusion: they&#x2019;d made a ruinous choice to leave port, one they&#x2019;d be lucky to survive.</p><p>As Devlin grabbed the ship&#x2019;s phone, another swell rolled the tug severely. The captain picked up on the other end.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s our heading?&#x201d; Devlin yelled into the receiver.</p><p>&#x201c;Due south,&#x201d; the captain said.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s no good,&#x201d; Devlin replied. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll never survive this side-on beating. We have to turn into the swells.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t, Padi,&#x201d; the captain insisted. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll take us into the teeth of the storm.&#x201d;</p><p>Gripping the bulkhead to keep from falling, Devlin watched a wave crash over the deck. &#x201c;This is madness,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We should&#x2019;ve never left Tarakan.&#x201d;</p><p>Tarakan was the primitive, almost backwater port where they&#x2019;d picked up the <i>Voyager</i>.<i> </i>The old liner had berthed there for repairs some years ago after an accident. She&#x2019;d ended up marooned when her shipping line went bankrupt several days later.</p><p>At some point, the ship was sold to a mystery buyer, but, for reasons unknown, the <i>Voyager</i> sat and rusted at Tarakan for three more years. Issues with the bankruptcy and squabbles about who would pay for the repairs, Devlin guessed.</p><p>Whatever it was, the ship looked like a derelict when they&#x2019;d found her; covered in corrosion from stem to stern, barely seaworthy. The hastily repaired damage from where the freighter had holed her looked like a jagged H near the bow. </p><p>Now, caught up in a storm that was rapidly getting worse, she was certain to go down.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the line?&#x201d; the captain asked.</p><p>Devlin glanced at the thick cable that stretched from the gigantic winch across the aft end of the tug and out toward the <i>Voyager</i>. The cable tensed and strained with the load before going slack again.</p><p>&#x201c;The cable&#x2019;s taut,&#x201d; Devlin said. &#x201c;That rust bucket is starting to pitch with these waves. She&#x2019;s definitely riding lower as well. We need to get the inspection crew back.&#x201d;</p><p>Against Devlin&#x2019;s wishes, the captain had allowed three men to stay aboard the cruise ship to watch for leaks. It was dangerous in these conditions and a waste of time as well. If she was taking on water, there was nothing they could do to stop it. And if she started to go down&#x2014;like Devlin thought she was&#x2014;they would need to cut the cable and let her go before she dragged the <i>Java Dawn </i>into the depths alongside her<i>. </i>But with three men on the ship, cutting that cable would be the closest thing to murder Devlin had ever done.</p><p>The big tug nosed over and dropped into the largest trough yet. As it did, the cable stretched so tight that it actually began to sing. The tension pulled the aft end of the tug backward, the water churning around the hull as the propellers fought against the strain.</p><p>By the time the tug rose up on the next swell, the <i>Voyager </i>must have been dipping into a trough of her own because the tow cable pulled downward, bending over the reinforced-steel plating at the tug&#x2019;s transom and forcing the aft end of the deck into the water.</p><p>Devlin raised binoculars to his eyes. The action of the waves had a way of obscuring the truth, but only to a point. The <i>Voyager </i>was definitely riding lower.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s down at the bow, Captain. Listing slightly to port.&#x201d;</p><p>The captain hesitated. Devlin knew why: this tow was worth a small fortune, but not if the ship didn&#x2019;t make it.</p><p>&#x201c;Call them back!&#x201d; Devlin shouted. &#x201c;For God sakes, Captain, at least call the men back.&#x201d;</p><p>Finally, the captain spoke. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been calling them, Padi. They&#x2019;re not answering. Something must have gone wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>The words chilled Devlin&#x2019;s core. &#x201c;We have to send a boat out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In this? It&#x2019;s too dangerous.&#x201d;</p><p>As if to emphasize the point, another wave hit them broadside and a thousand gallons of water crashed over the rail, flooding the aft deck.</p><p>The sturdy tug quickly shed the water, but moments later another wave swamped it more drastically than the first.</p><p>As the <i>Java Dawn</i> recovered, Devlin looked toward the <i>Voyager</i>.</p><p>She was definitely going down. Either a couple of hatches had blown or the shoddy repair job had caved in.</p><p>The captain must have seen it too. &#x201c;We have to let her go,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;No, Captain!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We have to, Padi. Release the cable. The men have a boat of their own. And we can&#x2019;t help them if we go down.&#x201d;</p><p>Another wave crashed over the deck.</p><p>&#x201c;For God sakes, Captain, have pity.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cut the cable, Padi! That&#x2019;s an order!&#x201d;</p><p>Devlin knew the captain was right. He let go of the phone and took a step toward the emergency release lever.</p><p>The deck pitched hard as another swell overran the stern and sloshed toward him. It hit like a wave at the beach, knocking him off his feet and dragging him.</p><p>As he got up, Devlin saw that the cab...</p></p><h2>Leading little ones to God: A child&#39;s book of Bible teachings</h2><p>Written in a sprightly, conversational style, Schoollands stories, as Moody Monthly has said, are told with clarity and simplicity unusual in Bible story books.

Drawing on groundbreaking insights into the brain's plasticity and integrative powers, including findings from his own research, Rosenblum examines how our brains use the subtlest information to perceive the world. &nbsp;A blind person, for example, can "see" through batlike echolocation; a Master Sommelier can actually taste the grape variety, region, and vintage of an obscure wine; and pheromones can subliminally signal a lover's compatibility.<br>To illustrate these implicit perceptual skills, Rosenblum takes us from the "beep" baseball fields where blind players swing at &nbsp;beeping balls, to a pitch-black restaurant where diners experience taste without the aid of sight. &nbsp; We accompany him on a visit to an Oscar-winning animator &nbsp;who explains how the public's expertise in perceiving faces has made his job so difficult; and a visit with a supermodel to discuss why beautiful faces are irresistible.&nbsp;<br>New studies have shed light on the surpising power and reach of our senses. It turns out that our brains use entire forms of perceptual information of which we are largely unaware. We can hear things that don't make sounds, feel things without touching them, see things with no form, and smell things that have no discernable odor. Throughout the book, Rosenblum not only illuminates the fascinating science behind our hidden perceptual powers, but demonstrates how increased awareness of these abilities can actually lead us to enhance how we use them.</p><p><b>Lawrence D.

Was he a bloodthirsty charlatan or the only true defender of revolutionary ideals? Was his extreme moralism--he was known as "The Incorruptible"--a heroic virtue or a ruinous flaw? Was he the first modern dictator or the earliest democrat?<br> Against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution, historian Ruth Scurr follows the trajectory of Robespierre's paradoxical life, from his unprepossessing beginnings as a provincial lawyer opposed to repressive authority and the death penalty, to his meteoric rise in Paris politics as a devastatingly efficient revolutionary leader, righteous and paranoid in equal measure. She explores his reformist zeal, his role in the trial of the king and the fall of the monarchy, his passionate attempt to design a modern republic, even his extraordinary effort to found a perfect religion. And she follows him into the depths of the Terror, as he makes summary execution the order of the day, himself falling victim to the violence at the age of thirty-six. <br> Written with epic sweep, full of nuance and insight, <i>Fatal Purity</i> is a fascinating portrait of a man who identified with the Revolution to the point of madness, and in so doing changed the course of history. <br><br></p><p>Born in 1971, Ruth Scurr studied at Oxford and Cambridge, where she currently teaches politics and history.

I do not mean a pompous, philosophical history, but a mixture of biography, facts and gossip: a diary of what really took place with the best authenticated likenesses of the actors.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ever yours,<br>&nbsp;<br>Robert Peel1<br>&nbsp;<br>Soon after he received this letter from his friend Sir Robert Peel, the once and future Tory prime minister, John Wilson Croker packed his bags for a seaside holiday. Although he was a prominent literary and political journalist and was hoping to work as he sat on the beach, Croker packed none of his collection of rare and fascinating books about the French Revolution that are now one of the glories of the British Library. He took with him only the list of those condemned to death during the Reign of Terror.2 He perused it against the rhythmic sound of waves breaking on the shore.<br>&nbsp;<br>Twenty-two impoverished women, many of them widows, convicted of forwarding "the designs of the fanatics, aristocrats, priests and other agents of England," guillotined.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nine private soldiers convicted of "pricking their own eyes with pins, and becoming by this cowardly artifice unable to bear arms," guillotined.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jean Baptiste Henry, aged eighteen, journeyman tailor, convicted of sawing down a tree of liberty, guillotined.<br>&nbsp;<br>Henrietta Frances de Marb&#x153;uf, aged fifty-five, convicted of hoping for the arrival in Paris of the Austrian and Prussian armies and of hoarding provisions for them, guillotined.<br>&nbsp;<br>James Duchesne, aged sixty, formerly a servant, since a broker; John Sauvage, aged thirty-four, gunsmith; Frances Loizelier, aged forty-seven, milliner; M�lanie Cunosse, aged twenty-one, milliner; Mary Magdalen Virolle, aged twenty-five, hairdresser: all convicted for writing, guillotined.<br>&nbsp;<br>Genevi�ve Gouvon, aged seventy-seven, seamstress, convicted of "various conspiracies since the beginning of the Revolution," guillotined.<br>&nbsp;<br>Francis Bertrand, aged thirty-seven, convicted of producing "sour wine injurious to the health of citizens," guillotined.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mary Angelica Plaisant, another seamstress, guillotined for exclaiming, "A fig for the nation!"<br>&nbsp;<br>Relaxing into his holiday, Croker continued reading through the long list of dubious charges against the several thousand victims of the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris, from its institution on 10 March 1793 until the fall of Maximilien Robespierre on 27 July 1794. He compiled some grimly fascinating statistics: in the last five months of Robespierre's life, when he supposedly secured tyrannous power over France and the Revolution, 2,217 people were guillotined in Paris; but the total condemned to death in the eleven months preceding Robespierre's Reign of Terror was only 399. On the basis of these statistics, Croker concluded that the executions "grew gradually with the personal influence of Robespierre, and became enormous in proportion as he successively extinguished his rivals."3 In awed horror he recalled, "These things happened in our time--thousands are still living who saw them, yet it seems almost incredible that batches (fourn�es--such was the familiar phrase)--of sixty victims should be condemned in one morning by the same tribunal, and executed the same afternoon on the same scaffold."<br>&nbsp;<br>Although Peel pressed his friend to write a popular and accessible book about the French Revolution, Croker never did so. When he got back from his holiday in 1835 he published his seaside musings in an article for the <i>Quarterly Review</i>. Here he acknowledged the enormity of the problem Robespierre still poses biographers: "The blood-red mist by which his last years were enveloped magnified his form, but obscured his features. Like the Genius of the Arabian tale, he emerged suddenly from a petty space into enormous power and gigantic size, and as suddenly vanished, leaving behind him no trace but terror."4<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2006 by Ruth Scurr</p><h2>Country Angel Christmas</h2><p>Sometimes the littlest angels can make the biggest difference, as these heavenly creatures find out as they prepare to host the Christmas celebration and manage to remember to provide some much needed starlight to light the darkest night.</p><p>Ages 3^-6.

Lit Guild &amp; Doubleday. Tour.</p><p>Marlo Morgan is a retired health-care professional. She lives in Lee Summit, Missouri. Her first novel, <em>Mutant Message Down Under,</em> was a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller for thirty-one weeks and was published in twenty-four countries.Morgan's much-hyped first novel, a fictionalized account of a "walkabout" she took in the Outback with a group of Aborigines, gains from the use of authentic detail, although the storytelling is hindered by the author's heavy New Age agenda and incessant cultural proselytizing. A 50-ish alternative health practitioner from the American Midwest, Morgan was working with underprivileged Aborigine youths in the inner cities of Australia when a group of Aborigines offered her a chance to learn firsthand about their culture. Morgan's account of the tribe's customs, healing methods, food-finding tactics, etc. is absorbing, and her willingness to forgo Western luxuries and to relish the experience is courageous and touching. Less compellingly, the author claims that she was "chosen" by the Aborigines to tell the rest of humanity that the so-called "real people" are refusing to reproduce because of the ravages of Western civilization, and that Westerners have a limited time to clean up their act. Morgan's rudimentary writing skills are stretched to the limit, and she lessens the power of her story and its egalitarian lessons by adopting the perspective that Western culture is innately inferior to the naturalistic beliefs of the Aborigines. Still, with its high-powered package of New Age philosophy wrapped in an adventure narrative, this book may be the next Celestine Prophecy.

Admittedly, he's been through a lot, what with intransigent Egyptians and backsliding Israelites. His God is a heavyweight, too, devising gruesome plagues, wiping out Pharaoh's army, and then slaying the 3,000 exiles who forgot themselves with the golden calf. Moses is as uncompromising as his God, who allows him only a glimpse of the Promised Land before he dies. Fisher's art emphasizes the starkness of the narrative. Human figures (their faces wholly or partly obscured) barely hold their own before the crushing vastness of the sky, Mount Sinai, the water-walls of the Red Sea, or the Brutalist architecture of Kadesh. This vengeful God and stern, flawed patriarch are certainly a strand of Western tradition, and Fisher's retelling (with God speaking in the awe-full cadences of the King James Version) takes Moses beyond the usual Ten Commandments scene. Nevertheless, Mordicai Gerstein's The Shadow of a Flying Bird (Hyperion, 1994), although focused on Moses's death and not his life, gives a much more positive impression of the patriarch and his achievements.?Patricia (Dooley) Lothrop Green, St. George's School, Newport, RI<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 4^-10. Fisher's version of the biblical story of Moses and the Exodus from Egypt suggests a great staged pageant, with richly colored paintings in the artist's signature style. Each double-page spread captures a mythic drama, with the Old Testament figures bold against mountain, desert, and sky, from the hiding of the baby in the bulrushes to the coming of the plagues, the parting of the waters, the wandering in the desert, and the receiving of the Ten Commandments. In one powerful close-up, Moses is horrified to see an Egyptian slave-master beating an Israelite. In another scene, God shows his power to Moses in the flames of the burning bush. The text is longer than usual for Fisher, and he combines biblical style and God's thundering cadence ("let My people go!" ) with a plain, sometimes colloquial, telling ("I have made a terrible mistake," Pharaoh says). Of course, this is the Passover story, but it's also the story of the oppressed everywhere and their struggle to be "free at last." <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Ciaphas Cain: Defender of the Imperium</h2><p>&nbsp; Omnibus collecting Death or Glory, Duty Calls and Cain's Last Stand, plus a new short story and introduction from author Sandy Mitchell.<p>Defender of the Imperium contains the novels <b><i>Death or Glory, Duty Calls</i></b> and <b><i>Cain&#x2019;s Last Stand</i></b>, plus the short story <i>Traitor&#x2019;s Gambit</i> and a new introduction from author Sandy Mitchell.</p></p><p>Besides his work at the Black Library, Sandy Mitchell (Alex Stewart) has had success as a writer of short stories and in TV.&nbsp; Along with Ciaphas Cain, Sandy has written several best selling Inquisitor novels&#34;An engangingly rougish hero, and realistic combat at both the strategic and very personal levels.

She lives in Seattle with her family.<b>Prologue</b><p>Lillian stood at the restaurant kitchen counter, considering the empty expanse in front of her. It was a Monday morning at the end of December and the restaurant held the calm that occurred only after the onslaught of holiday feasts, the culmination of a culinary season that began in the fall. In those months of ever shorter days, sometimes the only ingredients Lillian&#x2019;s customers could be bothered to take from their own kitchen cabinets were boxes of macaroni and cheese, bread for toast, and the restaurant provided both memory and inspiration&#x2014;golden half-globes of squash awash in butter, a lamb shank braised with the patience it would take to get through winter. After the exhilaration that was summer in the Pacific Northwest, autumn was like the sigh of an adolescent who realizes he must indeed grow up. It was Lillian&#x2019;s job to remind the people who sat at her tables that being an adult, the passing of a season or a year, was about more than just being older.</p><p>Still, Lillian thought, sometimes it was nice to be in the hush of an empty kitchen, without the heat of the ovens, the extra bodies of prep cooks and dishwashers and bussers and servers. This was what fed her&#x2014;this moment of stillness, the long, cool stretch of the counters and the give of the thick rubber mat beneath her feet.</p><p>She decided she&#x2019;d make a chowder, something simple and nourishing to take for her end-of-the-year appointment with Al, her accountant. Al wasn&#x2019;t quite old enough to be her father, but in many respects he had acted as one for her&#x2014;a steady hand and mind when she was first opening the restaurant and a dispenser of reliable advice in the eight years since. Their nonfinancial conversations revolved mainly around food; Lillian didn&#x2019;t know too much about Al&#x2019;s wife, and his silence regarding children led her to believe there were none. Al always seemed happiest when he was sitting at a table in the restaurant, or eating the lunches she brought to their appointments in his office. It was a small thing she could give him in return for all his insights, and she was glad to do it.</p><p>Lillian collected the salt pork and butter and heavy cream from the walk-in refrigerator, thyme from a pot on the windowsill, dried bay leaves from a glass jar in the row arranged along the wall. She turned on the heat under the pot and added the salt pork, which softened and began to brown. Her stomach grumbled; she remembered she hadn&#x2019;t eaten breakfast and cut a slice of bread, taking occasional bites as she sliced through the hard white flesh of the potatoes.</p><p>She removed the cracklings from the pot and added butter and chopped onion, the smells rising up&#x2014;onion never her favorite thing in the morning, but sometimes a chef didn&#x2019;t have a choice. She poured in chicken stock and then dropped in the potatoes, bringing the liquid to a boil and stepping away while they cooked. No point in pot-watching.</p><p>She returned to the walk-in refrigerator, using the intervening minutes to assess the food inside while her mind played with menus for the week. Leftover roasted red peppers and zucchini could be the beginnings of a pasta sauce; extra polenta could be sliced and fried in butter and sage. For all the glamour of restaurants, the underlying secret of the successful ones was their ability to magically repurpose ingredients, a culinary sleight of hand that kept them financially afloat and would have made any depression-era housewife proud.</p><p>Sensing the time, Lillian grabbed a package wrapped in butcher paper and headed back out to the prep area. The chunks of potatoes had softened. She smashed one against the side of the pot to thicken the broth, and then unwrapped the package.</p><p>As the white paper folded back, the smell of cod rose sinuously toward her, briny and green, the essence of old fishing nets and ocean waves. Nausea rolled up from Lillian&#x2019;s gut; she took one look at the fish and bolted for the back door.</p><p>Outside, she stood at the top of the stairs, gulping in the cold winter air.</p><p>&#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; she said to herself. And then she stopped and looked down at her stomach.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;</p><p><b>The Book of Rituals</b></p><br><p>When Al was a child, his mother was always showing him books with shapes in red and blue and yellow and green. Triangles. Squares. Circles, she said, pointing. But what he really liked were the shapes his mother called numbers&#x2014;the way the tall stick of a 1 seemed to be hiding its face from the elegant contours of the 2, the way the grandmotherly 3 nestled up to the stick-and-starch lines of the 4. Al&#x2019;s mother reminded him of a 7. If she had had bigger feet, she could have been a 2, he thought, but his mother always seemed to be floating a bit, or leaning&#x2014;against a countertop in the kitchen, the wall of the living room. Never quite sitting, never quite straight.</p><p>Over the weeks of Al&#x2019;s fourth summer, his mother taught him about counting, using ten straight sticks they collected from the backyard. Al paid attention dutifully, but he still thought that perhaps his mother had it all wrong. The straight sticks had their own purposes, but it was so much more fun to let your eyes slide up and around the slopes of a 9, the banister-curl of a 6. Even if you broke all the straight sticks up into tiny pieces, you could never recreate those curves.</p><p>The year Al turned five, his parents divorced and his mother relocated the two of them to Los Angeles. Compared with St. Louis, a land of thunderstorms that cracked the skies wide open and of snow that stopped the world into quiet, Los Angeles was almost overwhelming in its constancy, Monday passing the baton of hazy blue skies to Tuesday with unwavering tenacity. As Al&#x2019;s mother drove him around the city, checking out one apartment after another, Al began to believe that the buildings, the streets, the people, were like the weather, each one indistinguishable from the one before it, everything in shades of gray and beige.</p><p>It was like living in fog, Al thought as he stared out the car window. He remembered one night, not long before everything had fallen apart; he had snuck into the living room when his parents thought he was sleeping. They had been watching a movie where there was a lot of screaming and fog and a bad man who would come out of it and hurt people. But the heroine was smart; she found her way home by counting the doors along the street until she came to her own.</p><p>So Al began to count.</p><p>It was relaxing, he found. 6 buttons on his shirt and they were ready to go. 15 miles on the odometer, one clicking over to the next, and they were at their destination. It didn&#x2019;t matter that the destination looked no different from the other (9) apartments they had seen. The same (12) exterior steps from the first- to the second-floor units, the same (6) kitchen cabinet doors. Al couldn&#x2019;t figure out what his mother was looking for but one day they entered an apartment courtyard and his mother simply stopped.</p><p>&#x201c;This is it,&#x201d; she said. Al looked up at her. There were 3 sparkling stones at the corner of her glasses. A curl had come loose from the waves of her hair and dangled across her forehead.</p><p>&#x201c;OK&#x201d; he said. He liked that word. It was solid and simple and stood on its own 2 feet.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>Life in St. Louis had been leaf-drenched sycamore trees outside his bedroom window. A yard with grass that only got more and more green during the week, until Al&#x2019;s father went out on Sunday afternoon and the lawn mower roared into life, cutting the grass in long, straight rows, back and forth, back and forth, turning green into a smell that stayed on his father until he showered, an event that was always too far in the future for Al&#x2019;s mother and too soon for Al, who would follow his father around, breathing in the scent of sweat and gasoline and the moment when tall grass became short.</p><p>Los Angeles was a 2-room apartment with a nook of a kitchen. Al&#x2019;s mother slept on the foldout couch, and often Al did as well, for the bedroom, where she had carefully made the bed with his favorite sheets and painted the walls a friendly blue, still seemed too far away for him most nights. He didn&#x2019;t like the idea that there was nothing between his mother and the front door.</p><p>In this new city, Al&#x2019;s school was 3 blocks away. His mother would walk him in the morning, telling him he would have fun that day, although he wasn&#x2019;t sure either of them believed it. He would spend the morning with the other kids, drawing pictures of houses (which he didn&#x2019;t have) and families (ditto). Sometimes they played with puzzles whose pieces were made of numbers, and Al leaned into their familiarity with relief. More than once, his teacher had scolded him when she found the 7 hidden in his pocket. She told him the numbers belonged to all the children, but he didn&#x2019;t quite believe her. He could tell they cared only for the sound of the piece clicking into place. They didn&#x2019;t understand the way numbers could hold your life in their curves.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>One night in January, as Al&#x2019;s mother was tucking him into bed, she told him she had gotten a job.</p><p>&#x201c;The thing is,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s a special job and I need to be there in the evenings. But you&#x2019;re a big boy.&#x201d; She brushed his bangs back from his forehead. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be okay by yourself. I&#x2019;ll leave you dinner on a plate and then all you have to do is eat and put yourself to bed and when you wake up in the morning I&#x2019;ll be here.&#x201d;</p><p>Al wanted to tell his mother that he wouldn&#x2019;t be okay by himself&#x2014;that OK stood on its own 2 feet but all he wanted to do was curl up next to her on the couch. After his mother left that first evening, he stood in the middle of their apartment, listening carefully to the noises around him. He counted the cars and trucks driving by on the road until rush hour turned them into a stream too fast and thick for numbers, then he listened to steps walking along the corridor and the click of the lock as old Mrs. Cohen entered her apartment next door. It was quiet in Al&#x2019;s living room, the only sound the ticking of the baseboard heater that his mother said would eat his coat if he left it nearby.</p><p>The bad man in the movie always found people by their breathing. They would be hiding, in a shed or behind a door, and the bad man would hear the air racing in and out of their lungs and he would move forward, a smile slowly forming on his face. Al tried to stop breathing, but it didn&#x2019;t work&#x2014;and no matter all the other sounds of the world outside, you could still hear it.</p><p>Al looked around the living room and spotted the pink vacuum cleaner propped against the closet door. His mother hadn&#x2019;t even unplugged it in her hurry that day. Al knew he wasn&#x2019;t supposed to touch the machine, but he went over and flicked its switch and the roar blocked out everything else. He released the handle the way he&#x2019;d seen his mother do, and lined the machine up carefully, aiming straight at the other side of the room. Then he started pushing it in a straight row, back and forth across the green of the carpet.</p><p>After a while he heard a pounding on the door. He tried to ignore it, but it didn&#x2019;t stop and he finally turned off the vacuum cleaner.</p><p>&#x201c;That thing&#x2019;s been going for over an hour.&#x201d; Al recognized Mrs. Cohen&#x2019;s voice.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it too much to ask for a little peace?&#x201d; she continued.</p><p>Al stood, uncertain. His mother had said not to answer the door, but she didn&#x2019;t say anything about questions.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Al?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Al, I&#x2019;d like to talk with your mother.&#x201d;</p><p>This was not a question. Nor was it something that could happen.</p><p>&#x201c;Al? Are you there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is your mother there?&#x201d;</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>When Al&#x2019;s mother had come home that night to find her son sleeping on Mrs. Cohen&#x2019;s big blue couch, there had been a discussion between the two women that Al was luckily too sound asleep to follow. But afterward Al started going to Mrs. Cohen&#x2019;s apartment in the evenings while his mother was at work.</p><p>Al loved being at Mrs. Cohen&#x2019;s. Her whole apartment was blue&#x2014;carpet, furniture, walls, each of them a slight variation in hue until Al felt as if he was underwater or in the sky, or both. She had a long hallway lined with family photographs, and every night she took Al on her &#x201c;memory walk&#x201d; as she called it, strolling down the length of the hall while she told him stories about each person. Al liked the small stories best, the ones about her children and husband&#x2014;the time Rachel put a frog in her mouth, the summer Eli decided he was Captain Hook and walked around for two weeks with his sleeve pulled down over his hand. How Mr. and Mrs. Cohen first met on a ship coming from Europe when he was fourteen and she was twelve; the way he had taught her to sway with the boat so she wouldn&#x2019;t get seasick. Mrs. Cohen would always shift her feet back and forth when she told that story, and Al would join her, feeling the boat beneath them.</p><p>Mrs. Cohen cooked, too&#x2014;beef stew that had simmered all day, pancakes that weren&#x2019;t pancakes but a combination of potatoes and onions and warmth that floated through the apartment and snuck into the pockets of his coat. And something she called a kugel, its name as playful as the smell of vanilla and sugar and cinnamon that came from the oven. But Al&#x2019;s favorite thing about being with Mrs. Cohen was Friday night. When he arrived, the apartment would be filled with fragrance of chicken soup and there was always fresh-baked bread, its surface brown and glistening, lying in a fancy braid across the counter. At dinnertime, she would light one candle and let Al light the other, and before they ate she sang an almost-song in a secret language just for them. Al didn&#x2019;t know what the words meant, but he loved how peaceful they felt, as if the phrases themselves were setting down the weight of the days behind them. Al looked forward to Friday all week long.</p><p>And then, one day when Al was ten, his mother told him they would be moving. He would have a new father, she said. They would live in a house again, wouldn&#x2019;t that be lovely? And it wasn&#x2019;t so far away. But the neighborhood they moved to was different than anything he had seen before&#x2014;cul-de-sacs lined with white and beige rectangles set low to the ground. No stairs to count, the windows uninterrupted sheets of glass. And worst of all, no Mrs. Cohen, because no matter how many times his mother said they weren&#x2019;t moving far, it was apparently too far to visit, and Fridays were date night for his mother and her new husband. Al would sit in his room with the door closed, trying to talk in Mrs. Cohen&#x2019;s secret language, while the babysitter cooked frozen TV dinners until the apple cobbler transformed into a fruit brick.</p><p>Al&#x2019;s math classes were the one place where the world made sense during the eight years that followed. Solve for x, the teacher would say, and Al could almost hear the numbers whispering in anticipation, ready to dive under the bar of a fraction, disappear down the trap door of a subtraction sign. It could make you feel almost sorry for the x, Al thought, with everybody staring at it, concentrating, their only goal to leave it standing alone.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>When Al went to college, he took classes in accounting.

It is the story of an unusual kind of &#34;healing.</p><p>&#34;How can you be Jewish and believe in Jesus?&#34; The Telchins were a happy, close-knit Jewish family until the day their daughter called from college with a shocking revelation: She had become a Christian. Judy&#39;s decision prompted her father to set out to disprove the Messiahship of Jesus in order to win her back. To do so, he had to study the Bible for the first time in his life. In the face of increasingly convincing proofs that Jesus is who He claimed to be, Stan Telchin found himself confronting thousands of years&#39; worth of misunderstanding, hurt and prejudice from both sides. The key question that surfaced was this: How can a Jewish person embrace Jesus and Christianity without turning his back on his own people? More than thirty years after coming to know Jesus as Messiah, Stan Telchin reflects a passion to celebrate the heritage and culture of the Jewish people while seeking to unite Jews and Gentiles under the love of Messiah Jesus. Stan Telchin is a Messianic Jew who proclaims Jesus as Messiah in the United States and around the world, now under the umbrella of Jews for Jesus. He pastored a nondenominational fellowship in suburban Washington, D.C., for fourteen years.

Kessler&#x2019;s immersion in the new art and literature of Paris, London, and Berlin unfolds in the first part of the diaries. This refined world gives way to vivid descriptions of the horrific fighting on the Eastern and Western fronts of World War I, the intriguing private discussions among the German political and military elite about the progress of the war, as well as Kessler&#x2019;s account of his role as a diplomat with a secret mission in Switzerland.<br> &nbsp;<br> Profoundly modern and often prescient, Kessler was an erudite cultural impresario and catalyst who as a cofounder of the avant-garde journal <i>Pan</i> met and contributed articles about many of the leading artists and writers of the day. In 1903 he became director of the Grand Ducal Museum of Arts and Crafts in Weimar, determined to make it a center of aesthetic modernism together with his friend the architect Henry van de Velde, whose school of design would eventually become the Bauhaus. When a public scandal forced his resignation in 1906, Kessler turned to other projects, including collaborating with the Austrian writer Hugo von Hofmannsthal and the German composer Richard Strauss on the opera <i>Der</i> <i>Rosenkavalier </i>and the ballet <i>The Legend of Joseph</i>, which was performed in 1914 by the Ballets Russes in London and Paris. In 1913 he founded the Cranach-Presse in Weimar, one of the most important private presses of the twentieth century.<i> </i><br> &nbsp;<br> The diaries present brilliant, sharply etched, and often richly comical descriptions of his encounters, conversations, and creative collaborations with some of the most celebrated people of his time: Otto von Bismarck, Paul von Hindenburg, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Richard Strauss, Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Diaghilev, Vaslav Nijinsky, Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis, Sarah Bernhardt, Friedrich Nietzsche, Rainer Marie Rilke, Paul Verlaine, Gordon Craig, George Bernard Shaw, Harley Granville-Barker, Max Klinger, Arnold B�cklin, Max Beckmann, Aristide Maillol, Auguste Rodin, Edgar Degas, �duard Vuillard, Claude Monet, Edvard Munch, Ida Rubinstein, Gabriele D&#x2019;Annunzio, Pierre Bonnard, and Walther Rathenau, among others.<br> &nbsp;<br> Remarkably insightful, poignant, and cinematic in their scope, Kessler&#x2019;s diaries are an invaluable record of one of the most volatile and seminal moments in modern Western history.</p><p><b>Laird M.

Wednesday.<br><br>This morning we have arrived at Ems. We are staying at the villa Monrepos which is situated on the Lahn. We traveled in sleeping cars Baby, Mamma, Marie, and Sophie in one car and Papa and I in another. We arrived here at a quarter to twelve.<br><br>Ems. June 19, 1880. Saturday.<br><br>The whole of Ems is in mirth today for the emperor is coming. The Bahnhofstrasse and the bridge by which he must pass are decorated with flags, flowers, and shields. The emperor is to arrive at a quarter past five and at five ready to go and meet him after a most awful bustle, for the flowers Mamma and Baby want to give him have not arrived, we are all ready to go and meet him. Presently I see the carriage with, mamma, papa, and baby come back: the emperor is only coming at half past six. At six, deputations of schoolchildren, masters, and men pass our door, the men and boys with flags and drums the girls with bouquets and corn flowers. Soon we also go-nurse, Sophie, and I in the mob and mama, papa, and Baby to the station. We place ourselves behind the schoolchildren who have lined up all down the way the emperor must pass. As the festive hour approaches the crowd gets greater. Soon a screech as if everybody was at least being murdered reaches our ears but it presently appears to be the emperor's train that has arrived. Now the emperor's carriage comes and a hail of bouquets come down on it probably meant to put out his eyes, next to the emperor sits Count Lehndorff. Behind him come all his suite in other carriages.<br><br>Ems. June 20, 1880. Sunday.<br><br>This morning the emperor comes on the promenade and speaks to Mamma.<br><br>Ascot, St. George's School.

Thursday.<br><br>This morning I put down Uffington<br><br>a peg, at breakfast. We were talking together, when Uffington says, "Who is that blunderbuss, that fat female who came to see you." "I never knew I had any blunderbusses or fat females in my family," I answer with the greatest calm. This only shows too well how I and all my family are hated here by almost everybody.<br><br>Ascot. May 23, 1881. Monday.<br><br>It is my birthday today. I was born in Paris at the corner of the rue de Luxembourg and the rue du Mont Thabor at the 3 etage in 1868 but soon after went to Hamburg. When four I went to America and stopped there till I was five then I came to England and Mamma and Papa soon after (about two years after) settled in Paris where I was during the remarkably cold winter of 1879-1880. In which the cold amounted to 24 degrees Cent. I saw the Seine frozen. Papa came to see me today and brought me a barometer and microscope.<br><br>Ascot. July 9, 1881. Saturday.<br><br>Went to a review of sixty-two thousand volunteers but the most interesting of the thing was the queen's procession. In the first carriage was the queen in black the Princess of Wales in dark blue and the crown princess of Germany in white. In the same carriage but behind the queen sat John Brown the queen's favorite servant in black and silver. Then followed some huntsmen next came another carriage with the duchesses of Teck and Connaught and two other ladies then some more huntsmen and the princesses of Hesse-Darmstadt in blue then the officers of police and last but not least the king of the Sandwich Islands in another carriage. After these carriages came a royal huntsman in gold and dark crimson then came the Prince of Wales in some dark color with the badge of the Order of the Garter (blue), riding next to the crown prince of Germany in a white uniform, then came the dukes of Teck, Connaught, and Cambridge and the Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt the husband of the late unfortunate princess Alice. A lot of others of their staff closing the procession.<br><br>Ascot. October15, 1881. Saturday.<br><br>We were to go to Hampton court, where we were to lunch with Mr. Hodgekin today but as it hailed and rained we went to London instead. In the train we thought we would have our dinner so just as we had taken out our things we arrived at a station and heard the guard crying, "All change for London," so out we had to get holding our bread in our hands but we managed to finish our dinner in the other carriage. We got to Waterloo at two o'clock whence we drove to the Savoy Theatre in a bus to see Patience a most intensely utter play in the aesthetic line. It is chiefly written in an incomprehensibly tattoo language. After the theater we walked down Piccadilly without a poppy or a lily as the people in the play did. We had chocolate grange not mange and got home at about seven thirty. I am growing intense.<br><br>Ascot. October 16, 1881. Sunday.<br><br>I am utterly consummately intense wearing sunflowers and poppies and dahlias in my buttonhole.<br><br>Ascot. July 27, 1882. Thursday.<br><br>I received about the worst news I could have received today. The head has received a letter from Papa saying that I must leave this school this term and go to some Gymnasium or something like it in Baden. I wish I could stop here for at least another term, or any time, because I can by no means relish the prospect before me. I am very sorry at having to leave this place.<br><br>Adolf Kessler did not want his son to forget his German heritage, so he sent Harry to his alma mater, the Johanneum, a well-known Gymnasium, or elite German high school, in Hamburg, where he boarded at the home of a Pastor Bl�mer.<br><br>Hamburg. January 23, 1886. Saturday.<br><br>Papa came. He arrived from Leipzig this morning. He was out here at about eleven thirty with Aunt Lulu and without much beating the bush we went to the heart of the subject at once. Papa put the question of my future pretty plainly. Now I had been for days and for weeks I may say for months thinking and thinking and turning the thing this way and that without coming to a decision, and as I had from the very first foreseen, my ultimate answer was the work of a moment, what I had been brooding over for six months was decided in my mind at last in as many seconds: I first hesitatingly and then after watching the effect pretty positively said I wanted to study.6 So Papa went down to Pastor B. and after almost an hour and a half conference, during which I read Mamma's new article in the Figaro and talked with Aunt Lulu, I was called down and told that I was anyhow to stop till Michaelmas. I am satisfied at this and we must then of course have to come to a final decision.<br><br>Hamburg. January 31, 1886. Sunday.<br><br>Everybody and everything full of Bismarck's great speeches on the Polish question. I can hardly sympathize with him on this point, although I would not join the opposition in Parliament. But I must say I think it rather hard for some unfortunate people because they are Poles, although they have committed no earthly wrong except having gone on speaking Polish when their masters were speaking German, eo ipso to have no right to stop in Germany. It is very like the repeat of the Edict of Nantes or the expulsion of the Salzburg Protestants and I do not think it will do much more good. Such a strong measure is I think only justified in cases where everything else has failed, in Ireland for example. There I should hardly be opposed to the measure. But really to eject thousands of industrious farmers and tradesmen when no danger is impending is to my mind very much like despotism and will probably do more harm than good. On the other hand I think it wrong to go on caviling at Bismarck for having taken this measure and I have still less sympathy with Windthorst than with Bismarck.<br><br>Hamburg. February 13, 1886. Saturday.<br><br>Row in London on Monday. Oxford Street, Piccadilly, Regent-Street, South-Audley-Street, etc., sacked by the mob, people in the streets robbed of their valuables, carriages broken, shops wrecked. Damage about 100,000 pounds and all this in broad daylight by about five thousand people in the face of the police, and the soldiers in the barracks. It really sounds incredible. Why on earth were not the horse guards commanded to charge and disperse the mob if need be with their swords; really when it comes to saving the richest part of London from all the horrors of a pillage nothing is too severe. However there being a nice, comfortable, sleepy, liberal, Gladstonian government nothing has been done and not even the ringleaders as much as arrested. The worst is not even the lost and destroyed property, but that now the scum of the population has seen that if it only assembles in sufficient numbers it can take whatever and as much as it likes, it will most certainly take or make the opportunity oftener of helping itself. The consequences of the inaction in London are already being felt in the form of rows in Leicester and Birmingham where the strikers have simply demolished the factories. God knows what will happen next. The French Revolution merely began by a mob and a pillage.<br><br>This week I have read Jefferson's Byron, "Childe Harold," Macaulay's Byron and some more of his essays, a little of Pickwick, a little of Voltaire, besides working a good deal in Greek and Latin.<br><br>Hamburg. March 30, 1886. Tuesday.<br><br>News better. Although the strike has spread and is still spreading in Belgium, the worst seems to be past and the troops are apparently slowly but surely getting the better of the rebels. But the signs of the times are bad. Before the first French Revolution the marquesses and abb�s talked incessantly about bettering the situation of the tiers �tat, and now the tiers �tat talks a good deal about bettering the situation of the working men. If the better classes do not look sharp and really do something we will wake up one morning and find ourselves in the midst of the wreck of social order as the marquesses one fine day woke up and found themselves in the midst<br><br>of the wreck of the old aristocracy. It seems to me we are now since 1789 going through the same sort of process of regeneration the Roman world went through between 300 and 500.

He is the author of<em>Alamo Movies</em>,<em>William A. Wellman</em>, and<em>Between Action and Cut: Five American Directors</em>.This year's holiday animation release from Walt Disney is a real departure for the studio. The first major movie done entirely in three-dimensional stop-action animation, <i>Nightmare before Christmas</i> is the macabre story of Jack Skellington, "the Pumpkin King of Halloween," who is so delighted when he discovers Christmas that he decides to take over the role of Santa Claus. Tim Burton (<i>Batman</i>, <i>Beetlejuice</i>) came up with the idea 10 years ago when he worked as an animator at Disney during a more straitlaced era; since, things have loosened up enough at the studio for Burton to get the green light on his pet project. This volume, timed to coincide with <i>Nightmare</i>'s theatrical release, chronicles the film from its inception through all stages of production, with commentary from Burton and the other creators. It's loaded with artwork ranging from Burton's original sketches through scenes from the finished film. The groundbreaking movie is a commercially and artistically risky venture, but considering the track record of Burton and the success of Disney's recent animated features, it might just become a holiday perennial; if so, libraries would do well to have this print tie-in on hand. <i>Gordon Flagg</i></p><h2>Little Children: A Novel</h2><p><br>Tom Perrotta's thirty-ish parents of young children are a varied and surprising bunch. There's Todd, the handsome stay-at-home dad dubbed "The Prom King" by the moms of the playground; Sarah, a lapsed feminist with a bisexual past, who seems to have stumbled into a traditional marriage; Richard, Sarah's husband, who has found himself more and more involved with a fantasy life on the internet than with the flesh and blood in his own house; and Mary Ann, who thinks she has it all figured out, down to scheduling a weekly roll in the hay with her husband, every Tuesday at 9pm. They all raise their kids in the kind of sleepy American suburb where nothing ever seems to happen-at least until one eventful summer, when a convicted child molester moves back to town, and two restless parents begin an affair that goes further than either of them could have imagined.

The day before, her Sedona-based insurance agency where she was the office manager had been shut down by agents from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Her boss, Dan Frazier, had given her no advance warning that the raid was coming. In the hours since, she&#x2019;d tried reaching out to him over and over&#x2014;to no avail. He wasn&#x2019;t taking her calls, and as far as she knew, he hadn&#x2019;t tried calling her, either. Without hearing from Dan or having some kind of direction from him, she had no idea what she was supposed to do next. What was she was supposed to tell her employees, to say nothing of the firm&#x2019;s anxious clients?<br> <br>Try as she might, Haley still couldn&#x2019;t make sense of what had happened. Late in the afternoon, a group of men in suits had walked into the Frazier Insurance Agency and paused in front of the receptionist&#x2019;s desk. Although Haley didn&#x2019;t recognize the new arrivals, at first nothing seemed amiss. She assumed they were new in town and in the market for some kind of insurance coverage. As they continued to speak to Carmen Rios, the receptionist, however, Haley noticed the young woman growing more and more agitated. Finally, sensing something out of the ordinary, Haley left her own desk toward the back of the room and walked up to Carmen&#x2019;s.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the office manager here,&#x201d; she said, focusing on the man who seemed to be in charge. &#x201c;Is there something I can do for you gentlemen?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They claim they&#x2019;re from the SEC,&#x201d; Carmen whispered, sounding worried. &#x201c;They say we have to close the office immediately.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The SEC?&#x201d; Haley asked. &#x201c;You want us to close the office? What&#x2019;s this all about?&#x201d;<br> <br>The man standing directly in front of Carmen turned to Haley and extracted an ID wallet from his pocket. When he held it up for Haley&#x2019;s examination, she saw that it belonged to one Donald Ferris, a senior agent with the Securities and Exchange Commission.<br> <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I see that you&#x2019;re with the SEC, but I have no idea what that means or why you feel it&#x2019;s necessary to shut down my office. What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My understanding is that Daniel Frazier Jr. is the owner of this establishment. Correct?&#x201d; the guy asked.<br> <br>Haley nodded. &#x201c;Yes, but he isn&#x2019;t in right now. If you&#x2019;d like to leave a card&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ignoring her objection, Agent Ferris continued. &#x201c;Mr. Frazier is also a duly registered representative of a firm called Ocotillo Fund Management, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; Haley began, &#x201c;but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ocotillo Fund Management initiated bankruptcy proceedings earlier this afternoon. We&#x2019;ve been directed to shut down this office and take custody of any and all applicable files. Since some of your insurance customers are also investment clients, we&#x2019;ll be taking them all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re taking our files?&#x201d; Haley echoed. &#x201c;As for Ocotillo Fund Management filing bankruptcy? This is the first I&#x2019;ve heard anything about it. Besides, you can&#x2019;t just walk in here like you own the place. Do you have a warrant?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Funny you should ask,&#x201d; Agent Ferris said, producing a document from an inside pocket of his suit jacket and handing it over. &#x201c;You and your employees are to clear the premises at once. You may take personal items&#x2014;purses, cell phones, tablets, and such, but all company files and equipment are to remain here. If anyone attempts to remove files via something like a thumb drive or other device, they will be found and confiscated as you exit.&#x201d;<br> <br>When he said the words &#x201c;thumb drive,&#x201d; Haley remembered briefly that Millie Frazier, Dan&#x2019;s wife, had stopped by the office on Friday morning. She had seemed exasperated and more than a little put out. &#x201c;I had two appointments down in Paradise Valley later today, but Dan insisted that I cancel both of them and drive all the way up here to put this in the safe-deposit box,&#x201d; she had grumbled, holding up a postage stamp&#x2013;sized object.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Haley had asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;A kind of thumb drive,&#x201d; Millie said. &#x201c;I forget the real name&#x2014;micro something or other. A memory card, maybe. Dan says he has an adapter here that&#x2019;ll make it work in his dinosaur desktop. As for why he needed this little item to be in the bank this morning rather than later today or maybe even tomorrow morning? I have no idea. Anyway, you know how Dan is. Once he gets an idea in his head, it&#x2019;s &#x2018;my way or the highway.&#x2019; So that&#x2019;s my next stop&#x2014;the bank.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know thumb drives could be that small,&#x201d; Haley said, &#x201c;but it must be important.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Something to do with work, I expect,&#x201d; Millie allowed. &#x201c;Something he doesn&#x2019;t want falling into the wrong hands. How are things here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Haley had told her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Glad to hear it,&#x201d; Millie had said, then she was gone.<br> <br>Standing there facing down Agent Donald Ferris, Millie Frazier and her tiny memory card were the least of Haley&#x2019;s worries.<br> <br>&#x201c;Before you or your people touch a thing,&#x201d; she said, reaching for her cell, &#x201c;I need to check with Mr. Frazier.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Agent Ferris insisted. &#x201c;This warrant says otherwise. Now if you and your people will gather all your belongings and clear out, we&#x2019;ll be able to get started.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is outrageous. You can&#x2019;t just shut us down.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, we can.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For how long?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For as long as it takes&#x2014;maybe indefinitely. We&#x2019;ll be sorting through the material tonight and deciding what&#x2019;s to stay and what&#x2019;s to go. We&#x2019;ll send a truck here tomorrow to pick up what&#x2019;s going. In the meantime, I&#x2019;ve called a locksmith.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re changing the locks?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am. Once you leave here, no one&#x2019;s allowed back inside until we give the go-ahead. Presumably, you&#x2019;re in charge, so I&#x2019;ll need your contact information.&#x201d;<br> <br>With the phone pressed to one ear, Haley listened as her call to Dan&#x2019;s cell phone again went unanswered. &#x201c;Call me,&#x201d; she said when the voice mail recording came on.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s time,&#x201d; Agent Ferris said. &#x201c;We need to get started.&#x201d;<br> <br>It had taken only a couple of minutes for the eight office employees&#x2014;Haley included&#x2014;to gather up their goods and be herded into the parking lot, with all purses having been thoroughly inspected on the way out. Naturally everybody was upset, and a couple of the girls were crying. What was going on? Did they still have jobs? What were they going to do?<br> <br>Haley had done her best to be reassuring to the others, but that was a tough act to maintain, especially when a locksmith showed up in a van and proceeded to change the locks on the doors, both front and back, rendering Haley&#x2019;s prized master key useless.<br> <br>While the locksmith worked, Haley had continued to try to reach Dan. There was still no answer at any of Dan&#x2019;s numbers, but she finally left brief messages on all three. &#x201c;Please call me. Agents from the SEC came by and shut down the office. I need to know what&#x2019;s going on. Call me when you can. I&#x2019;m worried.&#x201d; As a last resort, she tried Millie&#x2019;s cell phone, too. There was no answer there, either, and Haley left yet another message.<br> <br>Gradually the other women drifted away to their cars. Haley stayed on, watching through the windows as a crew of workers dismantled the office. Computer terminals and keyboards were removed from desks and left in a heap near the front door. She was horrified to see the files from her superefficient wall-mounted and color-coded filing system be summarily tossed into a collection of empty Bankers Boxes and carted over to the door in no particular order. Had Agent Ferris allowed Haley to participate, she could have pointed out that files with blue tabs indicated investment clients only. Green and blue meant the customers had both investment and insurance accounts, while files with solo green tabs indicated insurance customers only.<br> <br>Watching the haphazard way things were stuffed into boxes and stacked in random piles left Haley sick at heart. Once the files were returned, it would take days to sort them and put things back to rights. If ever.<br> <br>What if the files never did come back? What if the demise of Ocotillo Fund Management spelled the end for the Frazier Insurance Agency as well? What if, rather than being a temporary measure, the office ended up being shut down for good? What would happen to her and to the other women who had worked there? During a mostly sleepless night, while fruitlessly checking her phone for incoming texts from Dan or Millie, Haley had wrestled with that question both for herself and for the others. What would become of them?<br> <br>As far as Haley was concerned, the Frazier Insurance Agency was the only place she had ever worked. Like little Carmen Rios at the reception desk, Haley had gone to work for Dan Frazier straight out of high school. Almost two decades later, she was the office manager and the beneficiary of a business continuation plan that would allow her to buy the business outright in the event of either Dan&#x2019;s retirement or death. But what if the business was wiped out completely? Where would she go then? With her experience and with professional designations to back it up, she supposed some other insurance company would hire her, but working for someone else wasn&#x2019;t something to look forward to.<br> <br>Haley&#x2019;s childhood had been chaotic at best. She had seldom ended a school year in the same school or even the same district where the year had started. The best thing her druggie mother ever did for her was to leave. As an awkward seventh-grader, Haley had been dumped into the care and keeping of her grandmother, Carol Hotchkiss. Not only was she an outsider in her new surroundings, she was also terribly behind as far as academics were concerned. Nonetheless, under her grandmother&#x2019;s tutelage Haley had come into her own.<br> <br>Carol had spent her adult life working as a secretary for a local attorney, and she had deemed that what had been good for her would be good for Haley as well. Carol had insisted that Haley learn to type, teaching her at home on an aged Toshiba laptop. She had also taught Haley the intricacies of shorthand&#x2014;something that was no longer offered in high school.<br> <br>Once out of high school, those basic but increasingly rare secretarial skills had been enough to get her an entry-level job with Dan Frazier. Eighteen years later, nearly forty, Haley was married to her job. At Dan&#x2019;s insistence, Haley had earned her CLU, CPCU, and ChFC designations, and those had been sufficient for Dan to promote her to office manager. For years her duties had also included many of the functions more in line with those of a personal assistant. Once Dan had joined forces with Ocotillo Fund Management, however, Haley&#x2019;s PA duties had been passed along to corporate hires down in Phoenix.<br> <br>Jason McKinzie had insisted that, as an executive with the firm, Dan have a full-time PA in Phoenix rather than a part-time one ninety miles away. The latest of these was Jessica Denton, someone Haley regarded as little more than a BBB&#x2014;blond, bombshell bimbo&#x2014;words Haley never uttered aloud. Jessie, as she liked to be called, may have been long on looks, but she seemed to be short on everything else, including shorthand and typing skills. Her occasional telephone conversations with Haley reeked of condescension.<br> <br>It hadn&#x2019;t taken long for Haley to resent this latest unwelcome addition, but thank goodness, Jessie was Phoenix-centric. She seldom ventured far from the city, and when Dan was back home in Sedona, it was easy for Haley to ignore Jessica&#x2019;s existence entirely and fall back into the comfortable old ways of doing things&#x2014;and running occasional errands when needed. Regarding Dan&#x2019;s Sedona-based clientele? At this point Haley knew his local customers far better than he did.<br> <br>But was that enough? Haley wondered. If Frazier Insurance had come to the end of the road, would her intimate knowledge of the business and her years of faithful service make it possible for her transition to a comparable job somewhere else?<br> <br>Although Haley was wide awake and had been for hours, she started when her alarm went off. Scrambling out of bed, she realized that, by now, the failure of Ocotillo Fund Management was probably not only public knowledge but a hot topic of conversation all over town. Even though the office would be closed, Haley&#x2019;s sense of responsibility prodded her to dress for work. After all, someone needed to be there to provide a company presence not only for concerned customers but also for whoever the SEC was sending to retrieve the Bankers Boxes packed with files.<br> <br>Dressed and with her makeup on, Haley headed for the kitchen, where she turned on the coffeepot and prepared to make the oatmeal that Gram insisted on having for breakfast summer and winter. While waiting for the water to boil, Haley switched on the television set in the living room, coming into the news broadcast just as someone mentioned Ocotillo Fund Management. By the time the segment was over, Haley was frozen in her grandmother&#x2019;s recliner and on the verge of hyperventilating. The broadcast moved on to a commercial break, but Haley stared unseeing at the figures on the screen with a storm of questions flashing through her mind. How had this happened? And would her office be able to weather the storm.<br> <br>By the time Haley staggered back into the kitchen, the water in the saucepan had mostly boiled away. As she started over on the oatmeal, she recalled one bit from the broadcast that had hit her especially hard&#x2014;the quote from an unnamed source, reportedly a former OFM employee, who claimed that the bankruptcy proceedings had come as a complete surprise to everyone.<br> <br>That couldn&#x2019;t be true, Haley realized. Dan must have known. Had to have known. She had worked with the man long enough that she understood his moods, both good and bad. It seemed to her that he&#x2019;d been in a dark place recently&#x2014;for the past several months, anyway. Now with the bankruptcy issue out in the open, she thought she understood why. He must have realized that there was trouble brewing with the SEC. Still, it hurt more than Haley could fathom that this man she had trusted so completely&#x2014;someone who had been the only thing close to a father figure in her life&#x2014;hadn&#x2019;t confided in her or given her so much as a single word of warning that disaster was looming. It was one thing for him to do that to relative strangers, but how could he do that to her?<br> <br>The oatmeal was almost ready to serve when she heard the click, click, click of her grandmother&#x2019;s walker coming down the hall. Haley reached for the remote to silence the TV set.<br> <br>&#x201c;Morning,&#x201d; Gram said, easing herself onto her chair and placing her walker off to the side. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother turning it off,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;I was watching the news in my room before I came out. Have you heard from Dan?&#x201d;<br> <br>Haley shook her head. &#x201c;Not a word.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Asshole,&#x201d; Gram muttered as Haley placed a cup of coffee and a bowl of steaming oatmeal in front of her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d think he&#x2019;d at least have the decency to call you back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d think,&#x201d; Haley agreed, taking her own seat.<br> <br>Despite whatever pitfalls the coming day might hold, Haley couldn&#x2019;t help smiling at her grandmother&#x2019;s plainspoken opinion, but then, Carol Hotchkiss had never been one to hold back. Two years ago, Haley&#x2019;s mother had dropped by for an unexpected and unwelcome visit, making her first appearance after an almost thirty-year absence.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t give a rat&#x2019;s ass about either one of us,&#x201d; Grandma C. had told her errant daughter. &#x201c;You may think you can show up after all these years and hope to hang around long enough for me to die so you can pick my bones. Well, my dear, you&#x2019;ve got another think coming. Haley and I are doing just fine without you, thank yo...</p><h2>Mystery!: A Celebration : Stalking Public Television&#39;s Greatest Sleuths</h2><p>Simply put, Mystery! A Celebration is a beautiful book. For any fan who has been captivated by the Edward Gorey cartoons, the erudite words of Vincent Price and Diana Rigg, or the tastefully assembled mysteries that make up the beloved PBS series, the volume (as P.D. James writes in the foreword) &#34;will give immense pleasure.&#34; The book begins with a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the early years of the series and includes an interview with Gorey, comments by Diana Rigg, and parting words from Vincent Price. The centerpiece, however, is the complete record of Mystery! episodes from 1980-1997.</p><p>Capitalizing on the popularity of the long-running PBS <i>Mystery</i> series, Miller has concocted a fanzine for the public-TV set. He lists each series that has appeared on the show since its inception in 1980, providing plot summaries, cast lists, reviews, photos, and interviews with authors, directors, and actors. Some of the trivia proves quite fascinating. An interview with John Thaw, who plays the popular Inspector Morse, reveals that even though Thaw doesn't drink, loyal fans constantly ply him with offers of ale and bitter on Morse's behalf. Sherlock Holmes fans will be delighted to know that the Abbey National Building Society, located at 217^-229 Baker Street, employs a full-time secretary to answer the hundreds of letters addressed to Holmes at his fictional 221b Baker St. headquarters. The book is well organized, well documented, and mostly well written, and it provides the kind of inside info that will delight <i>Mystery</i> fans hungry for details about the series. Lowbrow fun for highbrows. <i>Emily Melton</i></p><h2>Man from Mundania (Xanth, No. 12)</h2><p>Thousands of fans have eagerly awaited the thrilling climax to the newest Xanth trilogy.

It was dawn; the sun had not yet quite dared show its round face, because darkness made it nervous, but soon it would get up its nerve. She looked at the Tapestry, with its ever changing picture of Xanth. She never really tired of watching it, though her interest waxed and waned. It waxed when it rained outside because it was more fun to remain inside where it was dry, and it waned when Zora Zombie was waxing the stairs and the smell of the wax got chokingly thick. Thus, as she put it, it waxed when it waned, and waned when it waxed. It was her private joke with Dolph; the adults didn't understand. Adults were chronically slow about such things.Sure enough, Zora was waxing today; the smell was just starting. Ivy had only minutes to find a pretext to go far away, several days if possible, until the wax settled down. But she was running out of pretexts; what was left?She jumped out of bed so suddenly she frightened the monster under it--Grabraham; she heard his honk as he shrank away. He was a young monster, replacing Snortimer, who haddeparted long ago; he tended to be timid. She was also reaching the age when folk started not believing in Bed Monsters, and that made it that much worse. When she turned eighteen she would stop believing entirely, and the poor thing would fade away. Grabby was quite upset over the prospect, for some reason. She was sorry about that, but there was really no alternative; she couldn't stop herself from getting older.She ran barefoot to the next room where Princess Nada slept. Nada had moved in three years before when Dolph brought her home, and the two had become great friends, because they were the same age and rank and similarly pretty. Nada was only half human, but she kept her human form when staying at Castle Roogna, just from courtesy. Princesses had to learn courtesy early, because princes certainly didn't."Nada!" she cried. "I need a pretext in a hurry."Nada sat up in bed, wrinkling her nose. "I know; I smell it too. I'll go with you.""Of course! But where?"Nada concentrated. "Have we used the mirror yet?""We don't have the magic mirror!" Ivy reminded her. "Com-Pewter got it last year, and won't give it back!""Yes. So--"Ivy caught on. "So we'll just have to go and fetch it! Because I'll need it when I use the Heaven Cent!""Exactly. Except--""I know. Except that Com-Pewter isn't going to let us have it without a fight, and he fights dirty. Still, it's a perfect excuse, if we can only figure out a way.""Maybe Electra--""That's right! She could shock Pewter into letting it go!"Electra appeared in the doorway. "Did someone say my name?" she asked sleepily. She was a freckled child whose hair was a bit frizzy; her eyes were the color of wonder, and there were smile lines around her button nose. No one would think, to look at her, that she was tragically in love."Zora's waxing the stairs! Come help us get the magic mirror from Com-Pewter!""Is <i>that</i> what I smelled! Just let me get dressed!"There was a scramble as the three of them dived into proper clothing. In a moment they were together again; the two princesses in dresses, glancing jealously at Electra in her rainbow jeans. She was of common stock, so could get away with practical clothing. She was also slender enough to wear it without attracting stray male eyes or female frowns.Quickly they trooped down the hall to the farther stairway, avoiding the wax. Unfortunately this led them past Dolph's room, and he heard them. He had ears like those of a werewolf, perhaps because he commonly assumed wolf form to snooze. His door banged open. "Hey, where're you going?" he cried. "Are you sneaking out again?"Nada and Electra paused: Nada because she didn't want to hurt his feelings, Electra because she was in love with him. Both were betrothed to him, of course, though he was only twelve. In a moment Electra would invite him along, because she always wanted to be close to him.To prevent that, Ivy dived in. "We're going to get the magic mirror from Com-Pewter so I can have it when I use the Heaven Cent," she said. "So we can find out where Good Magician Humfrey is and finally complete your Quest.""But Mother won't let you--" he started, reasonably."So you'll have to cover for us!" Ivy finished. "'ye!"He still looked doubtful. But Nada stepped in and kissed him, not saying a word. "Uh, sure," he said. He was Silly Putty in her hands, of course, even though he knew she didn't love him. It was the mirror image of his association with Electra. He changed into zombie form and walked back the way they had come. Zombies didn't mind the smell of wax, so he would be able to brave those stairs despite Zora's mischief.They completed their escape. Whatever Dolph had done must have been sufficient, because no one tried to intercept them. Ivy whistled for Stanley, and in a moment the dragon whomped around the castle and joined them. He was almost grown now and soon would have to depart for the Gap because guarding it was his job. Ivy would be sad when he left, but knew it was the same as it was with her: age had itsburdens. Meanwhile, he was excellent protection; they had no fear of wild monsters while in the company of the tame one.They snatched fruits from the orchard as they passed through it, eating on the run. Then they reached the main path going north. Every so often Com-Pewter arranged to set up a D-tour, and then King Dor would send out someone to shut it down because it was a public nuisance. Ivy happened to know that there was a D-tour currently in force, and this time they meant to take it. It was the easiest way to reach the evil machine. They were supposed to stay clear of the infernal contraption, of course, which was part of what made him so intriguing. Stanley would be no protection against him, but Electra would.Sure enough, there was the D-tour. They veered onto it. Now they could relax, because even if it got shut down, they wouldn't lose it.They stopped for the night near the unlevel playing field where the Bulls and the Bears charged back and forth. Grundy Golem had discovered this during his Quest to locate the missing pet dragon. It was called the Market, and the Bulls and Bears were the Stock. Almost every day the foolish animals resumed their pointless activity, reacting dramatically to insignificant events and ignoring major events. There were many strange things in Xanth, but this business was too strange for even the craziest folk to understand. What did those Bulls and Bears find so fascinating about that Stock Market?Stanley whomped off into the thickest wilderness to catch a bite to eat, while the three girls harvested pies from a pie tree near the path. It wasn't much of a tree, but Ivy used her talent to enhance it, and then the pies became so healthy that they steamed. There were many more such trees along all the paths than in years of yore, because Ivy's mother, Irene, had seeded them in and made them grow, and Ivy had enhanced them.While they ate, they talked, for it was always fun to talk when there were no adults to listen in. Inevitably the subjectfound its way to Romance, for that was the most fascinating concept ever to approach teenage girls."When are you going to Find a Boy, Ivy?" Nada inquired. "I mean, you're well into seventeen, and when your mother was that age she had already landed your father and trussed him up.""And by the time my little brother was nine, he had already landed two fianc�es," Ivy agreed. "I confess to being retarded."Nada and Electra grinned ruefully. Nada had been fourteen when the young Prince Dolph had come to her father, the King of the Naga, for help, and because the naga needed an alliance with the humans, the King had agreed to help if Dolph married his daughter. Nada had had to pretend she was Dolph's age, nine, knowing that her real age would freak him out. It was only a betrothal, of course; they would have to wait until Dolph came of age for the actual ceremony of marriage. But meanwhile the alliance was valid, and Nada had kept company with Dolph while her folk received sundry items from the Castle Roogna arsenal to fight off the encroaching goblins. There seemed to be more goblins in Xanth than there used to be; no one was quite sure why, but it did make for trouble.Then the Heaven Cent had brought Electra to Dolph. She had to marry him or die, so Dolph agreed to be betrothed to her too. That had happened at about the time Dolph discovered that Nada was five years older than he, so it might have been an easy decision for him to make. But in the end he had realized that he loved Nada, so that betrothal had remained.Thus their quandary: they all knew that Dolph had to choose between the two girls before he came of age. If he chose Nada, he would honor his word to the naga folk, and as a prince he was bound to keep his word. But Electra would die. None of them wanted that.Three years had passed while Electra used her talent to charge the Heaven Cent. The three girls had become fast friends. So they accepted the situation as it was: unresolved. Electra loved Dolph, and Dolph loved Nada. Nada didn't loveDolph, and Dolph didn't love Electra. How was this picklement to be settled? No one knew, but it remained a favorite topic for conjecture. Fortunately it would be several more years before Dolph Came of Age, so the matter wasn't pressing yet."Didn't you know a boy, once?" Electra asked. She had been born more than eight hundred years before--maybe closer to nine hundred--and had slept through all those centuries until Dolph kissed her awake. So her physical age was fifteen, and she looked twelve; indeed, she was still a child in all the ways that counted, except for the spell that made her love Dolph. But because of that spell, she understood something of love and had a lively curiosity about it."Yes," Ivy said, remembering. "I knew Hugo, the Good Magician's son. He was five years older than me.""The right way around!" Nada said. They all knew that a boy could love a girl who was five years younger, but a girl could not love a boy five years younger. That was Nada's plight. She could marry Dolph, when the time came, but couldn't love him."Oh," Electra said, understanding. "So when the Good Magician disappeared, so did his son!""Yes. Hugo wasn't much, but he was nice, and he could conjure fruit. Only he usually conjured rotten fruit.""Rotten fruit!" Electra exclaimed, laughing. She plucked a cherry from her pie and tossed it at Ivy. "Have some rotten fruit!""Oh, so that's the way it is!" Ivy cried with mock outrage. She plucked a fragment of peach from her own pie and threw it at Electra. "Have a peach of pie yourself!" But Electra, childishly canny, ducked, and the piece hit Nada."Oho!" Nada said. Her pie was lemon meringue, but there were no lemon pieces to throw, so she threw meringue instead.In a moment they were engrossed in their very most favorite sport: a food fight. For some obscure reason this was frowned on at the castle, so this was a golden opportunity. When Stanley returned, all three were thoroughly spattered.The dragon offered to lick them clean, but at the first lick Electra dissolved into titillations of ticklishness, and that set them all off in helpless laughter.Fortunately there was a hot spring nearby. The three plunged in--only to indulge in a fury of splash-fighting, with piercing screams, while Stanley prowled in a circle around them, ready to help steam them clean. If it hadn't been for him, every predator in the region would have been there, attracted by the delicious sounds of shrieking nymphs.It was fun, being girls.&nbsp;<br>They camped for the night in a nest of pillows within the circle formed by Stanley, who curled around and caught his tail in his mouth. Ivy had told him the story of Uroborus, the giant serpent who circled the Mundane world (which it seemed was round) and grasped its own tail, and Stanley liked the notion, so now he slept that way himself. He was long, but really not that long; he could not hope to circle the world. It didn't matter, because he was only doing it for the feel of it. Meanwhile, they were quite safe, which was the point.When they got tired of walking, they took turns riding on Stanley. It was an art to remain perched while he whomped along, but they had had time to practice it. First the rider would be low, then riding high, then low again. Wheee! Electra took special joy in this, not ashamed to yield to her juvenile impulses. Ivy and Nada, being more mature (and in dresses), were obliged to pretend that it really wasn't all that special.As they approached Com-Pewter's cave, they paused for a consultation. "Should we try to hide our identities from him?" Ivy asked. Com-Pewter was really an "it" but it was easier to ascribe masculine evil, so they called it "he.""He'll never be fooled," Nada said. "He'll know we didn't come here just to giggle.""But maybe if we can hide our talents--"Nada shrugged. "We can try. But I don't think it will work. He certainly knows about Ivy.""Unless he's overconfident, so doesn't check, and--" Ivy's eyes flicked meaningfully toward Electra.Nada nodded. "When I change form, try to escape, distracting him--"Now Electra nodded. "Gotcha.""All else is bluff," Ivy said. "Maybe we'll pull it off without violence.""Maybe," Nada agreed, seeming less confident."Stanley, you go hide in the jungle," Ivy said. "After the invisible giant passes, sneak up and follow us, but don't let yourself be seen. That machine in there is devious, and we may need to be rescued if things go wrong."Stanley nodded. He was only a dragon, but in Ivy's presence his ferocity and intelligence were enhanced, and he understood her perfectly. He ceased whomping and slithered into the brush beside the path. In a moment his sinuous green body merged with the foliage and disappeared. He would be watching.They looked on, chatting innocently, in the way girls had when innocence was the last thing on their minds.The ground shook. "There's the invisible giant, right on cue," Ivy remarked. "Get ready to spook."The ground shook again. They paused, gazing wildly around. "What's that?" Electra cried, her hair flaring slightly. She was very good at spooking.There was another shake. "It's the invisible giant!" Ivy cried in seeming horror.<i>"EEEEEEEK!"</i> Nada and Electra screamed in perfect unison."Run!" Ivy cried.The three broke into a run, right toward the cave. That was the way Com-Pewter set it up: first travelers got onto the D-tour, then they were herded by the invisible giant until they took refuge in the cave--where they were trapped by Com-Pewter. They were walking into it deliberately, this time.Just before the slow-moving giant came into sight (as it were), they reached the cave and plunged in. It was dark, but in a moment a light showed deeper inside, so of course theywent toward it. Soon they were in Com-Pewter's main chamber.There he was: an odd collection of wires and colored metalware, with a big glassy screen sitting up in the center. Words appeared on this screen, written in light:GREETINGS, GIRLS.The...</p><h2>Hillary&#39;s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party</h2><p><b> The #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller and source for the blockbuster feature film <i>Hillary's America</i>, the top-grossing documentary of 2016...</b> <br> <br>Dinesh D&#x2019;Souza, author of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>America: Imagine a World Without Her</i>, has a warning: We are on the brink of losing our country forever.

So said Peggy Lee, the North Dakota girl who sang like she'd just stepped out of Harlem. Einstein adored her; Duke Ellington dubbed her "the Queen." With her platinum cool and inimitable whisper she sold twenty million records, made more money than Mickey Mantle, and along with pals Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby presided over music's greatest generation. Yet beneath the diamonds she was still Norma Delores Egstrom, insecure and always looking for acceptance. <br> Drawing on exclusive interviews and new information, Peter Richmond delivers a complex, compelling portrait of an artist and an era that begins with a girl plagued by loss, her father's alcoholism, and her stepmother's abuse. One day she gets on a train hoping her music will lead her someplace better. It does--to a new town and a new name; to cities and clubs where a gallery of brilliant innovators are ushering in a brand-new beat; to four marriages, a daughter, Broadway, Vegas, and finally Hollywood. Richmond traces how Peggy rose, right along with jazz itself, becoming an unstoppable hit-maker ("Fever," "Ma�ana," "Is That All There Is?"). We see not only how this unforgettable star changed the rhythms of music, but also how--with her drive to create, compose, and perform--she became an artist whose style influenced k.d. lang, Nora Jones, and Diana Krall. <br> <i>Fever </i>brings the lady alive again--and makes her swing. <br><br></p><p>Peter Richmond has been an award-winning reporter and feature writer for <i>GQ</i> magazine for two decades.

She was ten years old. The year was 1930. The town was Nortonville, North Dakota.Friends and neighbors had gathered on folding chairs on the floor below. Like most of the people in those times, they had little to spare. The Depression was as unrelenting as the summer winds that scoured their parched topsoil and buffeted the town hall's six narrow windows that day. But the people of Nortonville were happy enough to listen to the girl play, and not only out of a sense of obligation--everyone knew she had troubles at home--but because the fifth-grader with the remarkably upbeat disposition was an obviously talented child.Norma Egstrom had never performed in a venue as grand as the Nortonville town hall. The biggest room she'd ever played before was the practice space behind the sanctuary over at the modest Methodist church, where she sat at the Washburn upright piano. The town hall was the big time, the social anchor of a community boasting one bank, one hotel, threegrocers, a restaurant, a bowling alley, a blacksmith, a livery, a hardware store, and a railroad depot. A long, thin clapboard structure, free of architectural adornment, the hall had been raised from the dirt a dozen years before, in all of three weeks, by townspeople eager to see their crossroads claim some sort of recognition in the beleaguered grassy outback of the southeastern part of their state.It was here that Nortonville gathered to watch the motion pictures, as kids chewed the sunflower seeds that grew in the endless ocean of fields surrounding their homes. It was here that citizens came to hear the lectures that brought news about the world beyond the plains horizon. It was in the hall that they skated, played basketball, and danced. And it was in the town hall that Norma Deloris Egstrom made her public debut in a recital on that summer afternoon in 1930.Finishing her song, she rose from the piano stool and heard the applause: the unequivocal and tangible affection that only an audience can provide, a feeling that can be especially gratifying when acceptance is hard to come by in the usual places. She had always been a shy girl; she would later say that she'd sung before she talked. Now she'd spoken, and she'd been heard.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>People in Nortonville who recall that day won't go so far as to say that the girl was the best child pianist they'd ever heard, but they still marvel at her dedication. They speak of her with pride, though some concede that even before she played a note, the members of the audience were already disposed to like her. Norma Egstrom's dad, a father of seven, the station manager for the humble Midland Continental Railroad depot just down the street, was a gentle, kind, whimsical man. But he was also a drinker. He wasn't morose, or somber, or violent, but neither was he responsible or accomplished. Marvin Egstrom was a "rail"--an itinerant depot manager and agent--at a time when depots and railroads dotted the landscape of America.Before his sixth child's birth, Marvin's curriculum vitae had been a checkered one. He'd been a superintendent with the South Central Dakota line down in Sioux Falls until his drinking prompted the railroad to demote him to station agent. After that, he'd hooked up with the Midland Continental, up north in Jamestown, North Dakota, where, according to documents from the archives of the railroad's owner at the time, Egstrom had been associated with a scandal involving fraud and larceny.The railroad had exiled him to Nortonville, with a significant cut in salary, when Norma was eight.Most people who knew him would say that Marvin Egstrom and the everyday did not, in general, make a good fit, especially in a part of the nation where a man was defined by the acreage he owned. The railroad people had no real place there. They worked for a machine that signified transience in a state that was still enough of a frontier to pride itself on roots, literal and figurative. The Midland, not one of the more impressive lines, comprised only seventy-seven miles of track running north and south from Wimbledon to Edgeley with just a dozen stops in between.Marvin Egstrom was a pleasant, ineffectual man who, like nearly all of his family's members, had music in his soul. It manifested itself in unconventional ways, like the performance of an impromptu jig in the post office in the middle of the day, or a solo sung to the rails at two in the morning. "A couple of drinks," recalled one of Norma's classmates, "and her father could do the best soft-shoe dance you ever saw."Marvin's wife, Min--Norma's stepmother--cut a very different figure. She was stout, dour, congenitally cross, and surrounded by rumors. One concerned the freak accident in South Dakota--involving a torch and a frozen valve on a drum of gasoline--that had blown her first husband's head off. Speculation would persist that the man had killed himself. His widow's stern and humorless demeanor did little to lessen the credence of the tale.Other stories came closer to home, and were far more credible: Min Egstrom, it was whispered, beat her stepdaughter.The people of Nortonville (population 125) knew little about Norma's early childhood up the road in Jamestown, the county seat. Jamestown could boast the college and the mighty Northern Pacific's terminal, as well as the headquarters station of the humble Midland. It was also the home of the "bughouse"--the state mental institution, south of town.Norma's real mother, Selma Anderson Egstrom, had died in Jamestown at the age of thirty-nine, when Norma was four. In April 1924, she had given birth to her last child, a daughter named Jean, and was confined to her bed after that. On August 6, Selma passed away, leaving seven children: Norma, her five older brothers and sisters, and her infant sister. Marvin and Selma Egstrom had been married for twenty-one years.With the Reverend Joseph Johnson of the Scandinavian Lutheran church presiding, the memorial service was held in the Egstrom home. Toosmall to peek over the coffin's side, Norma was lifted up to peer into her mother's casket. She would recall seeing a frail woman at rest. Selma Egstrom's remains were sent to her family's hometown of Volga, South Dakota, where she was buried. Norma's infant sister, Jean, went to live with Selma Egstrom's sister until the girl's death, at age fourteen, of "a heart ailment of long standing."Norma was now the youngest in the household: a four-year-old with no mother, an alcoholic father, and her music. It was upon the occasion of her mother's death that Norma wrote her first song. "I remember writing a lyric to the song 'Melody of Love' when my mother died, when I was four," Peggy Lee would recall, many years later when her imagination and sense of her own myth had been heightened. "It wasn't a brilliant lyric, but I think it was interesting that a child would write one. I would walk around the house singing, 'Mama's gone to dreamland on the train.'"Norma's memories of her mother's home were vivid. In later years she would recall Selma's crystal and fresh linen, the scents of her baking, and the melodies her mother sang and played on the keys of her prize possession: a Circassian walnut piano. As in so many households of the time, entertainment in the Egstrom house was left to the creativity of the family, and music had always been part of the Egstroms' lives. Years later, a classmate would remember that both Della and Marianne Egstrom, Norma's two older sisters, had exceptional voices. "But they did not," recalled the classmate, "have the oomph to do anything about it."&nbsp;<br>Six months after Selma's death, the Egstrom home burned to the ground. Until the family relocated to another place in Jamestown, Norma lived with the former in-laws, and then the parents, of Min Schaumberg, who had been working as the nurse for Norma's married sister Della's first child.Norma enjoyed her time with the elder Schaumbergs as best she could. The old man's meerschaum pipe, his German-language newspaper, his old-world ways--these intrigued and comforted her. Best of all, they had a player piano. During the afternoons, the Schaumbergs would try to coax the girl into taking a nap in the parlor, but she spent more time on her knees pumping the pedals with her hands than she did sleeping.More often, Norma would be in the yard outside, peering out through the black iron picket fence as she waited for her father to visit and take her away, if only for a meal. One day Marvin Egstrom arrived with news: MinSchaumberg would be Norma's new mother. Min's son, Edwin, would be her stepbrother. One year to the week after her mother's death, Marvin Egstrom officially took a new wife. The unusual figure they cut--the thin, pleasant Marvin and the fat, frowning Min--would prompt many remarks."I didn't want to imagine him loving her after mama," Norma would later write in her memoir, <i>Miss Peggy Lee</i>. "I often wondered why Daddy and Min got married. Was it because of what Marianne and I heard ... about Daddy being asked by [his supervisor] to 'fix the books a little for the good of the railroad'? It was something about the per diem reports. Was it because Daddy was drinking and Min knew and might tell on him?"Far likelier was that Marvin Egstrom, a widower with several children, wanted a woman who could run his household while he tried to hold down his own job and his children did their share around the home and in the community. Like all the kids in Jamestown, Norma and her siblings who still lived at home--Marianne and brother Clair--would be sent out to help on local farms. It was Clair she was always closest to, though he did torment his little sister in the universal fashion of older siblings. When they had to harvest pails of gooseberries in a local park, Clair would stuff the bottom of his own bucket with grass and leaves and talk Norma into exchanging pails. When they'd help out on a local farm, Clair would get Norma to milk the cows that he was supposed to milk. As for Min's own son, Edwin, neither Norma nor Clair was particularly fond of him. The feeling was said to be mutual.It is not hard to imagine bashful, quiet Norma acceding to her older brother's schemes. Self-conscious about her weight and no doubt baffled by the inexplicable (to a young child) disappearance of her mother, Norma had trouble meeting someone's glance. Her reticence even extended to the legendary local barnstormer whose aerial antics above the fields outside Jamestown provided prairie entertainment. Still, despite her shyness, Norma was fascinated with Ole Olson's Curtiss; it was said he could pick up a handkerchief with the wingtip of his plane. Norma wanted to go up into the sky so badly that one day, when Olson told her he'd take her if she'd dance the Charleston for him, dance she did, and up she went.The escape was fleeting. Within days of her father's wedding, Norma's stepmother had wielded the willow switch she'd commanded the girl to pluck for punishment. Whatever the woman's motivation, discipline was frequent and formidable: "Florid face, bulging thyroid eyes, long blackhair to her waist pulled back in a bun, heavy breathing," was Norma's later recollection of Min. "Obese and strong as a horse, she beat everyone into a fright. Even the men were afraid of her."Added to the physical beatings were psychological ones. Her stepmother would criticize Norma's physical attributes: She weighed too much; her hands were too big. "I grew up terribly self-conscious of [my hands]," Peggy Lee once said, many years later. "I would hold them behind me ... fold them up, never present them flat to view but edge-wise only. I was one of the quickest handshakers you ever saw."&nbsp;<br>When the Midland relocated Marvin and his family down to Nortonville, the Egstroms didn't have much to move. Norma took her love of music, and a subtle sound that had imprinted itself in her head during the years she'd lived just a few blocks from the busy Northern Pacific tracks: the downbeat of iron boxcar wheels clacking one after another, hundreds of them, forever on end. She would carry the rhythm wherever she went--just as she carried the songs she had learned to love--for the rest of her life.Music surrounded her. With radio in its infancy, and with most of the prairie towns not yet electrified, it was routine for folks to play instruments in their homes. As Norma played her recital in 1930, windup Victrolas and Columbia Grafanolas across the land were featuring anthems designed to buoy the listeners: "Happy Days Are Here Again," "Puttin' On the Ritz." Even the instrumentals, like Ted Lewis's "On the Sunny Side of the Street," had a skip to them, a rhythmic current whose spirit could carry a girl along, afloat, away from the plains, with their infinite horizons. If Peggy Lee would grow to master the minimal, to practice the art of less-is-more, perhaps the empty, featureless plains of her childhood are owed some of the credit.&nbsp;<br>Make no mistake: Nortonville, North Dakota, was not a desperate place. It was a village where life was simply lived, and lived simply, a place where people would not abide self-pity. Largely of sensible Scandinavian stock, the residents did not complain about the things they couldn't control, like the windstorm that razed half of Bismarck, the state capital, one hundred miles due west, in 1929. Or the drought that made that same summer the driest in the state's history. The soil, already loosened by too many years of punishing droughts and settler farmers tearing up the prairie, was raked bywind that swept the Midwest from Texas to Canada and back again. The dust settled into people's pores, and the silt piled up a half-inch deep on the sills of Nortonville's windows. Women would hang sheets wetted at the town pump to keep the grit out of their homes. But nature's indifference wasn't personal, and it was best just to play the cards you'd been dealt.Like any small town, Nortonville was full of characters. Harmless little Hoover, a dim-witted boy, would dip his bucket into the pond outside of town again and again, in an effort to drain it and catch the duck out in the middle. Odd, boozy Fred Bitz's in-laws, who sold Fred their moonshine, were the last folks to see him alive before his body was discovered in his old pickup in the middle of a bean field. The suspicion was suicide by carbon monoxide. No one was surprised; life was growing increasingly unsettled. New faces arrived every day, men and boys dripping off the sides of the boxcars. The hoboes, many of them young--at the Depression's height, the army of men on the road included a quarter-million teenagers--came to the door asking for food. They passed word along about who gave a "lump" (a bit of food in a bag) and who was a "knee-shaker" (a more giving sort who dispensed a full tray). The odd markings on the pole at the end of one street had a secret significance: They were a private code that pointed out where to go for food, shelter, or work.Norma, as generous as she could afford (or was allowed) to be, gave the workers--among them the first Negro men she had ever seen--bread and butter. She felt for the boys turned out from their homes, their parents unable to support them. She felt for the older m...</p><h2>The Knight and Knave of Swords (Saga of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, Bk. 7)</h2><p>Fritz Leiber&#39;s immortal tales of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser reach a turning point with this new edition of Leiber&#39;s final stories of the two intrepid adventurers.

Little did his parents know that this child, born in the auspicious week of the Feast of San Donnino, would grow up to be not only a national hero of Italy, but also one of the most successful composers of all time. Many books have been written about Verdi's music, yet few have sufficiently covered Verdi the man. Now, in <em>Verdi: A Biography</em> Mary Jane Phillips-Matz brings us the result of more than thirty years' research on the life of this colossus of Italy.<br> Drawing on numerous original documents provided by Verdi's descendants, the Carrara-Verdi family, this long awaited biography presents a reexamination of Verdi's life not only as a composer, but as a philanthropist and son of Italy. Matz places Verdi against a backdrop of a century of fierce Italian nationalism that dictated that not only musical, but political considerations permeate his life and work. As Phillips-Matz writes, in Verdi's music, in the patriotic phrases of his librettos, "nationalism found a voice that aroused Italians to the cause of the <em>Patria</em>." In fact, Verdi's stature as a cultural icon rose to such heights that in 1861, he was pressured to serve on the First Parliament of Italy. As his close friend Carlos Cavour wrote, Verdi's membership would lend great dignity to the Parliament both in and beyond Italy and thus further the efforts of the national party in its fight for independence.<br> Here too is a glimpse into the personal life of Verdi--his turbulent relationships with his friends and family, his dedication to his music, his passion for his country. In defense of his second wife, former soprano Giuseppina Strepponi--shunned by his family for her tarnished reputation--Verdi obtained a legal separation from his parents and for a time withdrew from public life to ensure their privacy. In protest over the <em>Teatro La Fenice's</em> poor choice of a soprano for <em>La Traviata</em> (1853), Verdi threatened to defect from the project ("I have no faith whatsoever that it will succeed, and--on the contrary--it will be a complete fiasco"). And in the midst of the Austro-Prussian war of 1866, in which the very freedom of Italy was at stake, Verdi, objecting to France's support of Austria, asked to be released from his contract to finish <em>Don Carlos</em> for the Paris Opera (the opera house, however, did not think war a good enough excuse).<br> Upon his death in 1901 there were scenes of national mourning for the man whose actions had become a model, and music an inspiration to all of Italy. With an eloquent foreword by Andrew Porter, <em>Verdi: A Biography</em> brilliantly illuminates the life of the composer, patriot, and philanthropist who not only created the operas that would prosper generations after the artist, but who also emboldened the cultural pride of a country fighting for its freedom.</p><p>A magnificently detailed portrait of the great Italian composer (1813-1901) that refutes many myths and uncovers some unsavory new material, including the strong likelihood that before their marriage Verdi and Giuseppina Strepponi conceived several children who were abandoned at birth. Just as important as her full-bodied rendering of Verdi&#39;s personal life is Phillips-Matz&#39;s powerful delineation of his confrontations with pre-Unification Italy&#39;s foreign masters. Verdi&#39;s art was deeply political, she reminds us, and he used his wild popularity to ensure that it would be heard in the form he intended.<br><em>About the Author</em><br><strong>Mary Jane Phillips-Matz</strong> is Cofounder and Executive Board Member of the American Institute for Verdi Studies at New York University.<br></p><h2>Silent Seasons: Twenty-One Fishing Stories</h2><p>Fishing stories by Thomas McGuane, William Hjortsberg, Jack Curtis, Harmon Henkin, Charles Waterman, Jim Harrison and Russell Chatham.<br>Why fish? The answers laid forth in <i>Silent Seasons</i> are wildly divergent. Thomas McGuane cites both "the longest silence," and the opportunity to encounter a bass that runs with "the solid, irresistible motion of a Euclid bulldozer easing itself into a phosphate mine." William Hjortsberg admits to writing about fishing "for the money," while Russell Chatham remembers each detail as if it were intended for one of his paintings. To Jack Curtis, "The fish is a flash of beauty and action enticed from an unfathomable element"; to the late Harmon Henkin, angling "has no greater claim to spiritual purity than sex, dope, or any other recreation in contemporary America." Charles Waterman points out that fishing writers' sunsets are generally "more brilliant than those seen by milkmen and grain-combine operators." Jim Harrison argues psychiatric virtues: "Few of us shoot ourselves during an evening hatch."<br><i>Silent Seasons</i> has won praise for its assembly of fine writers and the tough stance they take on the ruin of the environment. Besides, as McGuane writes, "You can't say enough about fishing. Though the sport of kings, it's just what the deadbeat ordered."</p><p>Russell Chatham is an artist and writer residing in Livingston, Montana.

So why did he always cite his 1-9 A&amp;M team of 1954 as his favorite? This is the story of a remarkable team &#x2013; and the beginning of the legend.<br><br><i>The Junction Boys</i> tells the story of Coach Paul "Bear" Bryant's legendary training camp in the small town of Junction, Texas. In a move that many consider the salvation of the Texas A&amp;M football program, Coach Bryant put 115 players through the most grueling practices ever imagined. Only a handful of players survived the entire 10 days, but they braved the intense heat of the Texas sun and the burning passion of their coach, and turned a floundering team into one of the nation's best. <i>The Junction Boys</i> is more than just a story of tough practices without water breaks. An extraordinary fellowship was forged from the mind-numbing pain. The thirty-five survivors bonded together like no other team in America.

That season more than 100 Aggie hopefuls arrived in the small town of Junction for the first practice of a now legendary training camp. The sun bore down. The drills escalated. Trainers doled out water like gold, and meals and accommodations were horribly spartan. Ten hellish days later, only 34 remained to form the 1954 team that would only win one game, but those survivors--and that's what they were--formed the nucleus of the squad that would go undefeated just two years later. <p> This is the story of that team, that coach, the 10 days that shook their world, and the seasons they played together. "We lost alot (sic) of games," recalls Gene Stallings, who endured those days as a player and eventually followed Bryant as head coach both at A&amp;M and Alabama, "but Coach Bryant knew what he was doing. Out of the yellow dust and the broiling heat of Junction, he forged a team of champions." Jim Dent's evocative recounting is so real and immediate you'll feel your throat getting scratchy as you read. You'll also feel remarkable respect for the players who toughed it out--and for Bryant, who begins as a man possessed, but, day after day, as he breaks the backs of some and helps instill true grit in others, transforms into a human being. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>The legendary Paul "Bear" Bryant is recognized nationwide as one of the greatest coaches ever. So why did he always cite his 1-9 A&amp;M team of 1954 as his favorite? This is the story of a remarkable team - and the beginning of the legend.<p> In August of fifty-four, the town of Junction was a flyspeck on the map of Texas. The Texas Hill Country was in the grip of a five-year drought that had fried most of central and West Texas. On a day late in the month, two Greyhound buses weaved through a twisting and narrow two-lane highway. The Texas A&amp;M football team aboard, 111 strong, would soon arrive in a tiny town with no stoplights, one service station, and precious little else; just outside town, they would find an unforgiving patch of land littered with spartan Quonset huts, rocks, sandspurs, cactus, yellow dust and gnarled mesquite trees.</p><p> As Texas suffered from the devastating drought, so to did Texas A&amp;M football suffer from a drought of heart and talent. To the rescue came Bear Bryant, already a legend in the making, who was in no mood for a picnic. It was in Junction that he would make his stand, and it was here that he would drive home an extreme brand of blood-and-thunder discipline. In a calculated move that many consider the salvation of Texas A&amp;M football, Bryant put his players through the most grueling workouts ever imagined. Beneath a broiling Texas sun, practicing on a drought-scorched field, only a handful would survive the ten-day Aggie Death Camp. The ones who braved the torch-like heat and the burning passion of their coach helped turn a floundering team into one of the nation's best. </p><p> <i>The Junction Boys</i> recounts this training camp and the rebuilding program that culminated in an undefeated season just three years later. But this is more than just a story of tough practices without water breaks. An extraordinary fellowship was forged from the mind-numbing pain. The thirty-five survivors bonded together like no other team in America. They profited from the Junction experience; the knowledge they took back with them to College Station, about themselves and what they were capable of, would be used for the rest of their lives. Among the Junction survivors who would have a powerful influence on the game of football were Gene Stallings and Jack Pardee. </p><p> In vivid and powerful images reminiscent of <i>Friday Night Lights, Hoosiers</i>, and <i>The Last Picture Show</i>, these young men and their driven coach come to life. <i>The Junction Boys</i> contains all the hallmarks of a classic sports story, and it combines America's love of college football with an extraordinary story of perseverance and triumph.</p></p><h2>The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-vegetarian Critical Theory, 20th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>Taking its cues from the cinematic innovations of the controversial Austrian-born director Michael Haneke, Funny Frames explores how a political thinking manifests itself in his work. The book is divided into two parts. In the first, Oliver C. Speck explores some of Haneke&#39;s Deleuzian traits - showing how the theoretical concepts of the virtual, of filmic space and of realism can be useful tools for unlocking the problems that Haneke formulates and solves through filmic means. In the second, Speck discusses a range of topics that appear in all of Haneke&#39;s films but that haven&#39;t, until now, been fully noticed or analyzed. These chapters demonstrate how Haneke plays the role of &#34;diagnostician of culture&#34; how he reads - for example - madness, suicide and childhood. Like several other contemporary European directors, Haneke addresses topics considered difficult when measured by the standards of commercial cinema: the traumatic effects of violence, racism, and alienation. Funny Frames is an incisive and original contribution to the growing scholarship on one of the most intriguing auteurs of our time.</p><p><p><b>Carol J. Adams </b>is an activist and author of <i>The Pornography of Meat</i>, <i>Living Among Meat Eaters</i>, and many other books challenging a sexist, meat-eating world. She is a sought-after speaker throughout North America and Europe, and has been invited to more than 100 campuses to show "The Sexual Politics of Meat Slide Show," which is always being updated to include contemporary cultural representations.</p>Writer/activist/university lecturer Adams's important and provocative work compares myths about meat-eating with myths about manliness; and explores the literary, scientific, and social connections between meat-eating, male dominance, and war. Drawing on such diverse sources as butchering texts, cookbooks, Victorian "hygiene" manuals, and Alice Walker, the author provides a compelling case for inextricably linking feminist and vegetarian theory. This book is likely to both inspire and enrage readers across the political spectrum: we learn, for example, that veal was served at Gloria Steinem's 50th birthday, as well as of the atrocities of the slaughterhouse. One wishes Adams had been more careful about documenting some of her claims--her contention, for instance, that early humans were entirely vegetarian, requires scholarly support.

This book examines life on earth from the viewpoint of beings belonging to a distant world, led by the &#34;all-wise Beelzebub&#34;, who is able to perceive the weaknesses and follies of humanity and, through his compassion, can point the way towards possible regeneration. Through this cosmic allegory, Gurdjieff demonstrates a methodology for the spiritual growth of mankind.</p><p>Editors' Note <p>Gurdjieff wrote <i>Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson</i> from 1924 through 1931, and continued in later years to make significant revisions. Before his death in 1949 he entrusted the book and his other writings to Jeanne de Salzmann, his closest pupil, with instructions for future publication. Mme. de Salzmann had followed Gurdjieff for over 30 years and played a central role in his decision in the l940s to organize the practice of his teaching. </p><p>Gurdjieff wrote <i>Beelzebub's Tales</i> in Russian and Armenian, and the original manuscript was typed and revised in Russian. An English translation was produced in successive steps at the Prieur�. It consisted initially of a word-by-word interlinear translation with each word in English placed above the corresponding Russian word in the typescript. Reworked by different pupils at different times, the translation was finally edited by the well-known author and editor A.R. Orage, mostly in New York. Although he worked closely with Russian speakers and, indeed, Gurdjieff himself, Orage knew no Russian and was unable to read Gurdjieff's original text. </p><p>The English version was first published in 1950, just a few months after Gurdjieff died. He had overruled objections that the translation needed more work, insisting that the time had come to launch his ideas into the mainstream of Western thinking. As the English text was the initial publication of the book in any language, it was assumed by many readers to have been written or specifically approved by Gurdjieff. Although a prefatory note stated that the original was written in Russian and Armenian, the significance of this was easily disregarded in the absence of a published edition of the original Russian text. The note also stated that the author had personally directed the translation, and Gurdjieff had often been present when the translation was read aloud to English-speaking pupils and visitors. </p><p>What few readers knew was that, in fact, all of Gurdjieff's work in completing the book was in Russian. His spoken English, like his spoken French, was effective and memorably colorful for his purposes as a teacher in conversation with his pupils, but since his arrival in Western Europe in the early 1920s, he had not taken the time to master either language. He could not have judged, much less approved, the English text and had to rely on Mme. de Salzmann, who was fluent in Russian and English, for reassurance that the meaning was preserved. Gurdjieff did not approve the writing style of the English translation. </p><p>Although before his death Gurdjieff had insisted on immediate publication, he reportedly acknowledged that the English book was a "rough diamond" and asked Mme. de Salzmann to revise it at a later time. Her first priority was to prepare the French edition based on the Russian manuscript, a task that was not completed until 1956. Thereafter, she began work with selected American pupils to revise the English language version. The primary aim was to bring it closer in substance to the Russian text, using the widely admired and well accepted French edition as a model. A secondary but important aim was to have it correspond more faithfully in style to Gurdjieff's Russian writing, particularly to make it as clear and understandable as the Russian. Mme. de Salzmann herself worked for a number of years with the editorial team and then left them to complete the project. The revision, despite interruptions, was finally completed more than 30 years later.</p><b>G. I. Gurdjieff</b> was born in 1887 in Alexandropol.

Haiku are clearly shown to be a means of discovering and recording the miracles of the world, from the humorous to the tragic. This is one of the major themes underlying <em>Writing and Enjoying Haiku</em>-that haiku can provide a way to a better life. <br><br>After looking at why the reading and writing of haiku is important from a spiritual point of view, the book shows, as has never been done before, the techniques of writing-the when and the where, punctuation and capitalization, choice of words, figures of speech, sharing haiku, and much, much more. <br><br>Having come this far, having learned to read and write haiku with a discerning mind, the reader will never again look upon the world in quite the same way.</p><p><br>Author and translator, with a special interest in haiku, tanka, and renga, JANE REICHHOLD is a three-time winner of the Haiku Society of America Merit Book Award. She has been a member of the Haiku Society of America, Haiku Poets of Northern California, Haiku Canada, Haiku International (Tokyo, Japan), German Haiku Society, and Poetry Society of Japan.

Poetry (www.ahapoetry.com).<br>Foreword: Toward Enjoyment <p>Though the word "enjoying" is the third word in the title of this book, for me enjoying anything and everything is the primary function of our lives. True, the function of this book is to teach you how to write haiku, but I want you to first learn to touch a point of pleasure within yourself with haiku. </p><p>To do this, you will need to open the arms of your mind to take in some haiku already snapped up out of the air and written down. </p><p>Because the haiku in the following selection are all connected to one subject, with a wide variety of techniques and levels of complication, you can explore them with a gentle touch of your eyes as if looking over a branch to choose which flowers you might pick. You do not have to like or understand all of them, but just take up each one and examine it carefully. </p><p>Read them not only to see what has been thought, and to delight in this sharing, but allow the words to move across any similar memory or past idea you may have had. In this way the haiku pick up your patterns as iron filings arrange themselves on a magnet to be changed in a once-in-a-lifetime relationship. </p><p>Even as you do this, it is possible the writer in you will begin itching to change a word here and there. Something small and loud and very close to you will want to put the words in a different way than I have, or even to write a line on a totally dissimilar subject. Listen to these urges and begin here, beside my words, to write your own versions of the poems in the wide spaces on the page (assuming you have not borrowed this book from the local library). </p><p>Toss out the memory of the teacher who told you never to mark in your books and tell your inner critic, who might be insisting you know nothing about haiku, just to back off and be quiet. Think only that you have decided to enjoy seeing where these haiku lead you, and to explore what they find within you. </p><p>I want this book to be your book -- with sentences underlined, comments written in the margins, your poems on the flyleaves, and your first thoughts beside these haiku in the introduction. </p><p>Go slowly. Take each haiku separately; read and reread until you have completely thought through it, around it, and beyond it. Write down whatever thoughts come to your mind before moving on to the next haiku, even if you need to get a separate pad of paper. Tape the pages of your words among my words. Do the altered book art-thing. Make these pages a symbiotic work between the two of us. </p><p>Let go of any preconceived ideas and simply do whatever brings you the most enjoyment. This is your life, the book you are writing. </p><p>silence <br>between words <br>stories </p><p>desert <br>stretched to the horizon <br>silence </p><p>silence <br>when naked and alone <br>a tunnel </p><p>pond lilies <br>floating in their centers <br>silence </p><p>silence <br>in a rain shower <br>seven colors </p><p>winter leaves <br>buds of tightly rolled <br>silence </p><p>silence <br>around a waiting bird <br>the nest </p><p>silence <br>after the hailstorm <br>colder </p><p>silver-tipped firs <br>snow deepening <br>silence </p><p>silence <br>between crashing waves <br>the briefness of foam </p><p>riptide <br>in the sea the pull of <br>silence </p><p>silence <br>drawing together lovers <br>a silver cord </p><p>a blossom's dance <br>the urges deep within <br>silence </p><p>Later, when you have read the rest of this book, do come back here to see yourself as you were in the beginning.

She warns her grandson that a white mitten will be hard to find if he loses it in the snow, but of course he promptly does just that! What happens next is the surprising part, as a mole takes refuge in the lost mitten, then a rabbit, then a hedgehog, an owl, a badger, and a fox. If you think the mitten might be a wee bit stretched out at this point, just wait: "Then a big bear sniffed at the mitten. The animals were packed in tight, but the bear didn't care. He crawled in anyway." <i>The Mitten</i>, a runaway holiday hit, is now packaged in a lovely gift box with a set of pale gray, stretchy acrylic, machine-washable, one-size-fits-most-kids-under-five mittens, complete with hedgehog decal.

In minutes, the ship is ablaze (and doomed), and our seven luckless protagonists are adrift in two small boats. They make their way to land, only to find themselves the captives of one of the last remaining pirates operating off the China Coast. But Missee Lee, as it turns out, is no ordinary pirate; her father had sent her off to Cambridge University to prepare her for a life as a teacher. But when her father takes ill and dies, she finds herself struggling to hold together the Three Island Confederation (Tiger, Turtle, and Dragon) he had created, and to be recognized as his legitimate heir and ruler of the Island Kingdom.<br>Ransome is, as always, the consummate storyteller. Here he takes the reader not only on the usual sailing adventures and cliff-hanging escapades, but also into Chinese culture. (It's no accident that, like so many of Ransome's protagonists, Missee Lee is a woman, or that her Latin is almost as refined as her sailing skills.) It is also no wonder that The Observer called this, the tenth book in the series, "his best yet . . . a book to buy, to read, and to read again, not once but many times." The Guardian put it "in a class by itself." For Ransome, unlike so many writers of his and our generation, was particular in writing about things he knew and had studied first-hand, whether it was a foreign culture, a classical language, a cryptographic code, or the finer points of seamanship.</p><p>&#x201c;He makes a tale of adventure a handbook to adventure.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Observer</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;There is plenty of excitement, a little danger, a quality of thinking, planning and fun which is delightful and stimulating.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>TLS</i>Arthur Ransome was born in 1884. He was in Russia in 1917 and witnessed the Revolution, which he reported for the Manchester Guardian. After escaping to Scandinavia, he settled in the Lake District of England with his Russian wife where, in 1929, he wrote Swallows and Amazons. Thus began a writing career that has produced some of the best children s literature of all time.</p><h2>Sundog</h2><p>Bound in publisher&#39;s original green quarter cloth with green paper board.The story of an American foreman, Robert Corvus Strang, as told to Jim Harrison.</p><p><b>Jim Harrison</b> is the author of three volumes of novellas, <i>Legends of the Fall, The Woman Lit by Fireflies, and Julip;</i> seven novels, <i>Wolf, A Good Day to Die, Farmer, Warlock, Sundog, Dalva,</i> and <i>The Road Home;</i> seven collections of poetry; and a collection of nonfiction, <i>Just Before Dark.</i> He has been awarded a National Endowment for the Arts grant and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He lives in northern Michigan and Arizona.<p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> So I moved slowly north, passing through dozens of springs, virtually traveling north with greening spring herself overhead and below, pausing here and there to wait for her and for my own courage to gather. You see, I was on the verge of doing something truly different in my life, something totally unexampled. Usually I drove north along the Eastern Seaboard to New York City and, later in June, to our cottage near Sag Harbor. My wife would fly ahead, lacking my affection for long drives. But now I had lost both the modest New York co-op and the Sag Harbor property to her in the divorce -- not so much lost, but gave them up in an attack of kindness, much to the disgust of my lawyers and accountant. She was shocked but happy, what with a boy and a girl in their early teens from a previous marriage. My motive, oddly, was the memory of an unhappy move from Marquette to East Lansing, Michigan, at age twelve. The experience marked me deeply, and since I loved these children and had recently reread the great Dostoevsky, I had become at the same time serene and captious. But then this is not my story, and I will keep my intrusions to a minimum. </p><p> On impulse I had bought one of those large, involved, four-wheel-drive sporting vehicles and felt a little silly on the seven-hour drive from Key West to Palm Beach. Later, I decided, I might add some sensible plaid shirts to my wardrobe, a pair of boots, perhaps a hat with a feather in it. The vehicle had delayed me three extra days in Key West while I waited for the addition of cruise control; my gout-ridden right toes could barely handle a gas pedal. </p><p> I had been corresponding a bit with the older tycoon mentioned previously -- I have promised not to mention his name because of his prominent political and financial affiliations. This seemed unnecessarily cautionary at the time, but later, when the situation became explosive, even grotesque, the stipulation appeared sensible. In any event, our tycoon had invited me to stop by for dinner, an event I had anticipated because of the reputation of his cook. The real reason for the invitation was that his daughter, the ex-wife of our unmet hero, was home for a week and he thought I might speak to her. I was ill-disposed to her because she hadn't answered a letter, but also curious when I beard she was a doctor specializing in tropical medicine for the World Health Organization. </p><p><br> "The deepest feeling of all is that there should be more," be said, from behind a small but billowing cloud of Havana smoke. </p><p> "There <i>is</i> a lot more. You just can't see it from anywhere you bother looking," she said. She was a mean woman, though she clearly loved her father. She had managed to ignore me in a way that couldn't be ignored. I was flushed, almost uncomfortably past enjoying my food and wine. There was an urge to present some fresh, invented credentials to supplant the ones she had apparently dismissed. I kept trying. </p><p> "But isn't it inherent in the idea of personality to wear blinders of some sort? You maintain that your father and myself are ignorant of a world that is the target of your intensest curiosity Perhaps we are. Unfortunately, in the gunnysack holding all the possible attitudes on earth, the most offensive one that can be drawn out is that of moral superiority." </p><p> "Right!" she laughed. "I hate it. This town forces me into it." </p><p> "That's why it puzzles me that you won't talk about your former husband. I told your father that when I've been fishing or hunting in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Africa, wherever, I've met such people and their energy fascinates me. It rarely occurs to people like myself just who actually goes into a jungle and builds an immense dam or who engineers the irrigation of thousands of acres of desert. All I simply proposed is that I write about this man, say for <i>Vanity Fair</i> or <i>The New Yorker</i> or <i>Atlantic,</i> because it would be good for us to see this aspect...." </p><p> "Maybe you could bring some Giorgio Armani models along, and they could sweep across the top of a dam and Scavullo could shoot them with a leg up against a turbine, or with a group of dark, smoky Brazilian workers." </p><p> "You're not being fair." Now I was more than reasonably pissed off. </p><p> "I'm being quite fair. It's such silly, scheming bullshit. We've become like the French. Everything must be <i>incroyable</i> or <i>bizarre.</i> If the information is sufficiently novel, it's a twenty-minute buzz while the bath is being drawn, sort of a three-dollar round-trip ticket before bedtime. Your type is drunk on novelty, not reality." </p><p> "You're the most unbelievable bitch I've ever met." I gulped my Calvados and choked. The father roared with laughter and pounded the table, then I somehow began to strangle and hyperventilate at the same time. The room began to dim as if by a rheostat, and I was facedown in my pear sorbet and ch�vre cheese. I barely felt their hands on my shoulders as they helped me, with the aid of a black butler, to a sofa. As my vision cleared, I became drenched with cold sweat. She ran out of the room with a certain alarm in her eyes. </p><p> "I'm very sorry," I said, trying to get up, but my arms felt numb like rubber ganglia. </p><p> "Don't say a thing. Evelyn is hard on people, to put it mildly." </p><p> "I'm so sorry." She bad returned with a medical bag and the trace of a smile. I was too frightened to be angry, and she had softened to the point of becoming attractive. She intently checked my heart rate and blood pressure, during which I could see most of her breasts. Somehow they looked like serious breasts, the sort that an effete writer would never get to tinker with. </p><p> "Not to panic you, but you're in terrible shape. Very high pulse rate, blood pressure 165 over 112, at least thirty pounds overweight." She slapped my tummy. "You could support an African village on what you spend on your gut." Then she gave me a sedative and denied me a nightcap. I was sent up to bed with two kindly handshakes. </p><p> In the morning I was alone in the house, except for the servants. To my delight, the butler delivered an ample breakfast along with <i>The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post,</i> and the <i>Miami Herald</i> for spice. There was also an envelope from Evelyn which I opened immediately. </p><p><br> <i>Father chided me for bitchiness which was the reason, he reminded me, that mother was exiled to Rancho Mirage for a death tan. Not quite sure what to say about dear Strang. I had met him several times, then got to know him when I treated him for schistosomiasis. Haven't seen him since the accident, but reading the company's report the prognosis isn't good. Also the herbal remedy he tried for his petit mal epilepsy, otherwise totally controlled, has further cast him askew. He's had a dozen or so tropical diseases in the past twenty-five years and is pretty much physically burned out. </i></p><p><i> This isn't very helpful. You might key on what he calls the theory and practice of rivers. If you want to get into gossip, Strang understands women better than any man I have ever met. </i></p><p><i> Meanwhile, I looked in on you early this morning and you were grasping your penis like a seven-year-old waif. Follow the enclosed diet or you'll never see fifty. </i></p><p><i> Con amore,<br> Evelyn</i> </p><p><br> The diet turned out to be suitable for someone with the disposition of a Gandhi, a Sister Theresa, a Gautama Buddha -- some tiny, brown, selfless person. I, however, resolved to follow it and skipped lunch, supplanting the meal with a hundred-mile-long sexual fantasy about the good doctor Evelyn. If I weren't a gentleman, I might let you in on the details. I was heated up to the point that I reached for a bottle of La Begorce in my snack container. The wine broke down my food resolve, and consequently I swerved off the Interstate south of Macon and followed the red dirt road to Home Folks Barbeque, indisputably the best barbeque shack in the United States. Of course, I had been planning this move subconsciously for an entire day. Despite our well-advertised standard of living, a certain heartiness was gone out of American life. I've always insisted that <i>cuisine minceur</i> was the moral equivalent of the foxtrot. On my way south in January, I had stopped at Home Folks for an enormous take-out order. Some of the sauce bad spilled indelibly on the marble tile floor of my Palm Beach rental, costing me several thousand of my damage deposit. A pungent sauce, to say the least, slathered over racks of pork and beef ribs. A sauce not to be confused with those hokum b�chamels served over gaily decorated baby hamsters in New York City, home of the most otiose food faddism. Strangely, Doctor Evelyn seemed to peer up from the glistening pool of sauce, and I called for a doggy bag. </p><p><br> Crossing the Ohio-Michigan border, I again lost the sense of my quarry and the good sense behind the pursuit. The otherwise fair May afternoon turned dark and blustery with the arrival of a northern front, well advertised on the radio but somehow unexpected. I imagined Michigan as some huge, bruised mitten, floating in the hostile frigid waters of the Great Lakes. Above the Straits of Mackinac, the Upper Peninsula sat alone, perhaps the least-known land mass in the United States. In this age where every niche on earth has been discovered and rediscovered countless times, there is an open secret why the upper Midwest is generally ignored: it is relatively charmless, and it competes with Siberia for the least hospitable climate on earth. Perhaps I'd stop and see my mother, then head for Montana. Or Paris. </p><p> My spirits seemed to drag under the car when I noted an Irish setter, a big male, trotting up the median strip with a jaunty gait, as if Route 75 bad been created for him. As I passed, be darted toward the southernbound lanes, where an immense semi struck him square and he was burled brutally upward and out of view. </p><p> It was a mile before I exhaled. My life narrowed to the gray, windswept highway, and my remaining support systems diminished into the ugliness of the blurred scenery. It was what a friend of mine, a former infantry lieutenant in Viet Nam, called the "old organ slide," where all sense of a personal destiny is lost. For a moment the dog had become the Irish setter of my youth, but then be had died at the end of my bed one winter night. And what had become of that shy, red-haired girl I had loved as a young man in New York? It was Merlin who invented the yo-yo which mirrored so perfectly those mood shifts, before he sank wisely back into the ooze of history. Otherwise we would have had an Eichmann trial for Merlin, and the world would have been attentive for a change. </p><p><br> I spent a disarming three days with my mother, mostly reading about the Upper Peninsula and studying maps, a wonderfully senseless vice. When a housecat can't figure out what to do, it merely sits down. We made an obligatory trip to the cemetery, since I wasn't going to be there for Memorial Day. (I had never been there for Memorial Day.) But first, at dawn, we went bird-watching, certainly her ruling passion. I had been worried about the apparent rate of her aging, but I could barely keep up with her as we looked for the first of the migratory warblers. These tiny birds, barely noticed by the world, were her obsession. We reached the cemetery before the gates were open and sat in the car drinking coffee from a thermos, waiting for the attendant. The earth had become lovely and pale green again after the storm passed through. A loutish gardener with a namepatch stating "Bert" appeared with keys, announcing to us, "The early bird gets the worm," a statement Mother thought wonderful and I thought in bad taste. She saw a vireo near the ten-year-old grave which she had cultivated with flowering crab and a mountain orange. My father had been a botanist, and I came up short of knowing more than a few trees and plants. I was embarrassed to be hungry. </p><p> "Let's go have breakfast," she said. She was always on the money when it came to actualities: death, worms, food, Mozart, and birds owned their anointed places. </p><p><br> Mother awoke me before dawn, under her lifelong conviction that all journeys should start as early in the day as possible. We were always the first to arrive at picnics, planes, ball games. I was red-eyed and frayed from a late night of studying notes and drinking an emergency pint of whiskey. The whiskey performed the function it was designed for -- several hours of grace in which the drinker becomes convinced again of his viability as a human being; his personal narrative resumes structure, and the grace of knowing what one is doing returns. </p><p> We crept out the back door after a bowl of oatmeal and fruit -- I had stupidly shared with her Evelyn's diet. Our stealth was to be my brief good-bye shot at bird-watching. There was a myrtle warbler building a nest at the edge of the backyard. The bird was minuscule, somewhat like a smudgy mouse with wings. Then we made a skirmish in a clearing near a swamp to see a male woodcock in its mating flight. She told me that they perform the dance from evening until dawn for two months in the spring. I watched intently, mostly because I have eaten these birds in France, where they go under the name b�casse. I told her so. </p><p> "How shameful, son. Think how they dance all night for love, month after month. You've certainly neglected God's plan for your life. You've been divorced twice, and your health is a mess. And you eat these unbearably lovely birds. I still love you, but it's not always easy." </p><p> She gave me a kiss on the cheek, then went back to the woodcock, who wheeled higher and higher in gyres, with odd little cries in the first light, then returned toward earth in an amazing, fluttering spiral. I wished him luck. I waved at Mother from my absurd vehicle, but she hadn't turned around. I wished myself luck. </p><p>Copyright � 1984 by Jim Harrison</p></p><h2>The Gospel of Matthew Volume I (The New Daily Study Bible)</h2><p><p>Though we find the Gospel of Matthew first in the New Testament, many scholars believe that the Gospel of Mark is older. Matthew then is often seen as an expansion of Mark, incorporating most of the content of Mark while also adding sections that contain the teachings of Jesus, such as the Sermon on the Mount, and stories about the birth and infancy of Jesus. The Gospel of Matthew presents Jesus as one who is "God with us" even until the end of time.</p><p>For almost fifty years and for millions of readers, the Daily Study Bible commentaries have been the ideal help for both devotional and serious Bible study.

She gathered her household together and set off with her husband, her housekeeper and her small dogs on a four-month tour of Italy. Her articles were published in 1904 as Italian Villas and their Gardens. One of the first books to treat the subject of Italian garden architecture seriously, it influenced a generation of garden writers and landscape architects. Nearly 100 years later, photographer and writer Vivian Russell set out on her own odyssey, following Edith Wharton&#39;s footsteps around Italy to photograph the best surviving gardens from her book and to tell the story of how each one was made. her lively text describes the patrons and architects who created the gardens and explores their hidden symbolic meaning.</p><p>Though most know her as the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of novels such as <i>The Age of Innocence</i> and <i>The House of Mirth</i>, Edith Wharton was also something of a doyenne of domestic taste, and fortunately neither a nearsighted nor a parochial one. She published the first serious treatment of Italian garden architecture, <i><i>Italian Villas and Their Gardens</i></i>, in 1904. A lifelong Italophile as well as a lifelong gardener herself, Wharton had an instinctive attraction to both the clipped precision and the sensuous disarray that characterize an Italian villa garden. Nineteen of the gardens Wharton and her illustrator Maxfield Parrish brought to public attention are virtually unchanged by the passage of the single century since her descriptions were written. Garden photographer and writer Vivian Russell has recaptured both the essence of the gardens themselves and Wharton's experience of them in a series of luscious photographs and historical summaries of each garden. The Villa Cetinale, pictured on the cover from the vantage point of its lemon garden, was singled out by Wharton for its charm and its long green park, marked by a 15th-century gateway at one end and a <i>romitorio</i>, or hermitage, at the other.<p> The book's considerable charm lies in the historical perspective it affords of Wharton and her Victorian colleagues as well as the many centuries borne so gracefully by the beautiful land they loved. It's a marvelous homage to Wharton and a must-read for all lovers of things Italian.</p>VIVIAN RUSSELL is a writer and photographer. She has written three other books on Monet - Monet&#39;s Landscapes, Monet&#39;s Waterlilies, and Planting Schemes for Monet&#39;s Garden.

In this special collection, Tamasin Day-Lewis provides classic recipes and new twists for an assortment of savory and sweet tarts. She explores the rituals of their preparation, from rolling to primping and patching to whisking, all of which make tarts the most satisfying of foods &#x2014; to make and to eat.<br><br>The home chef is taught to prepare a variety of crusts from easy-to-follow directions. The most difficult step is trying to figure out which of the mouth-watering fillings to use. Included is everything from Sweet Corn and Spring Onion Tart to Rhubard Meringue Pie. <br><br>Beautifully designed, featuring more than fifty full-color photographs, and sumptuously filled, <b>The Art of the Tart</b> is sure to be the perfect addition to any cookbook collection.</p><p>Tamasin Day-Lewis writes so beautifully, so eloquently, and so descriptively that it's almost impossible to choose which of her exceptional, delectable tarts to begin with. Her tone is warm, friendly, and generous, and her attitude towards food and cooking will make you nod and smile and want to read this cookbook aloud to anyone who'll listen. She laments that the "current speed-addicted climate" has pushed so many of us to give up cooking from scratch. We have been convinced to make questionably nutritious fast food instead of relishing the relaxation, pleasure, enjoyment of not just preparing good food, but of eating it in the way it is meant to be eaten--by savoring it slowly.<p> Early childhood memories of standing on a kitchen chair, cuffs covered with flour, making her first tarts, and then impatiently biting into a hot jam tart and the sweetly searing pain that results inspired Day-Lewis to write this book. Tarts, she argues, are superior fast food. With practice, the dough can be made quickly and in batches large enough that there's no need to make the dough every time. Fillings can be as simple as the onions, eggs and cream necessary for the Onion Tart. And longer recipes are just longer, not any more complicated or difficult to follow. "Anyone reading this book," says Day-Lewis, "should not doubt his or her ability to achieve every one of the recipes." She assumes "basic skills and competence," and a bit of curiosity. Many of these recipes are remakes of old favorites, but because Day-Lewis is writing in the U.K. and Ireland, most of those old favorites are brand new in America. The Leek, Potato, and Oatmeal Tart is a substantial cold-weather dish made with oatmeal crust filled with garlic, leeks, potatoes, and cheddar. Treacle Tart is "gloopy, gooky, toothachingly sweet," best served with "a solid spoonful of clotted cream slipping deliquescent from the slice, turning buttery at the edges as it slides." How can anyone read that and not start checking the kitchen for ingredients?</p><p> Divided by the chapters "Savory Tarts," "Sweet Tarts," and "Other People's Tarts" (try Nigel Slater's Broccoli, Blue Cheese, and Cr�me Fraiche Tart and Richard Corrigan's Banana Tart), the book is sprinkled with vibrant color photographs of lusciousness such as the Peach, Vanilla, and Amaretti Tarte Tatin ("amber-hued ... speckled with vanilla and sticky with caramel") and the bright yellow Corn and Scallion Tart with a Polenta Crust. Day-Lewis is inventive, as is evident with recipes such as Monkfish Tart with Bearnaise, Tomato, Goat's Camembert, and Herb Tart; Rhubarb, Honey, and Saffron Tart; and Br�l�ed Black Currant or Blueberry Tart. If your taste buds (or those of your audience) are less adventurous, you can start with Asparagus Tart, Potato, Garlic, and Parsley Torte, or Quiche Lorraine. And no one will ever turn down a "state-of-the-art" Lemon Tart, a Strawberry Tart ("voluptuous ... and glazed to gloopy perfection"), or Simon Hopkinson's Chocolate Tart ("If there is a heaven, this is it," says Day-Lewis). Whatever your time frame, your kitchen comfort level, or your palate, Day-Lewis will leave you with your cuffs in flour, composing a thank-you note in your head to this most delightful author. <i>--Leora Y.

A man who has made the gospel musing an art form, Elder Maxwell offers such gems as a pithy description of those &#34;who are willing to serve the Lord but only in an advisory capacity,&#34; or the compassionate reminder that &#34;those trembling and shivering for want of a little praise and encouragement surely need the warming caress of commendation.&#34; This beloved apostle generously shares with readers the doctrinal basis of his own admiration and adoration of Jesus and identifies the source of the spiritual energy required for true conversion. In doing so he invites us to make the necessary mid-course correction in behavior and attitude that will keep us on course in our own journey of discipleship.</p><p></p><h2>Whiplash (An FBI Thriller)</h2><p>Yale professor Dr. Edward Kender's father is undergoing chemotherapy when the supply of a critical accompanying drug suddenly runs out. Unwilling to accept the drug company's disingenuous excuse of production line problems, Dr. Kender hires private investigator Erin Pulaski to prove that something more sinister is going on at Schiffer Hartwin. <br><br> Meanwhile, in Maryland, married FBI agents Lacey Sherlock and Dillon Savich are investigating a rather unusual case: Senator David Hoffman is experiencing a ghostly apparition with possible malicious intent. The case is baffling, and Sherlock and Savich are not sure what to believe, even after witnessing the disturbing specter for themselves. They're no closer to cracking the case when a call comes in from Connecticut: A top foreign Schiffer Hartwin employee has been found murdered behind the drug company's U.S. headquarters. <br><br> Unbeknownst to the FBI, Erin Pulaski had uncovered a bombshell in her investigation: The Culovort shortage is set to bring in a windfall profit in excess of two billion dollars. Upon learning of the murder, Erin is certain it has something to do with her findings, but she risks exposing herself by coming forward. As the feds move in, the case becomes even more complicated for Erin, since the murder of a foreign national on federal land can mean only that the pharmaceutical house has a secret of epic proportions-one it would do anything to keep hidden.</p><p><strong>Jayne Ann Krentz and Catherine Coulter: Author One-on-One</strong> <br> In this Amazon exclusive, we brought together blockbuster authors Jayne Ann Krentz and Catherine Coulter and asked them to interview each other. <br> <br> The author of over 40 consecutive <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers, <strong>Jayne Ann Krentz</strong> writes romantic-suspense, often with a psychic and paranormal twist, in three different worlds: Contemporary (as Jayne Ann Krentz), historical (as Amanda Quick) and futuristic (as Jayne Castle). There are over 30 million copies of her books in print. Read on to see Jayne Ann Krentz's questions for Catherine Coulter, or turn the tables to see what Coulter asked Krentz. <br> <br> <strong>Jayne:</strong> You have a fabulously successful career going in two genres, romance and suspense. Why do you write both? What are the elements in each genre that excite and compel you as an author? <br> <br> <strong>Catherine:</strong> Do you know, I love to write both genres because they are so very different from each other, and that means, frankly, that I&#x2019;ll never run out of creative gas or get myself stuck in a burn-out hole. In most of my historical romances (just like yours) there are mysteries because my mind simply works that way (just like yours). To be defined as a romance, the relationship between the man and the woman must be at the center. And as you know, in suspense thrillers, unlike romances, it&#x2019;s the gnarly situations that are at the center, and the love story?and there usually is one, because relationships are at the center of life?, is at the periphery. In the thrillers, I&#x2019;m focused on pacing (i.e., making the reader turn that page), and juggling two different gnarly situations. And maybe, if I&#x2019;m blessed, I can go back and forth, stretching the denouement for both to a good hundred pages. <br> <br> <strong>Jayne:</strong>When you wrote the wildly successful book <em>The Cove</em>, those of us in the romance genre cheered wildly. We were thrilled because you opened a door for a lot of us romance authors (like me) who were eager to infuse more suspense into our books. At the time, many of us were meeting with resistance from editors who feared we would lose our audiences. But you proved that the audience would follow. Any deep background you care to share about what inspired you to write that book or how you got it published? <br> <br> <strong>Catherine:</strong> Lots of writers had branched out before I got into the FBI series. <em>The Cove</em> came about when I was at home for a family reunion. My sister, who&#x2019;d never done anything like this before, walked up to me and asked, &#x201c;Have you ever heard of a little town on the coast of Oregon called the Cove? They make the world&#x2019;s greatest ice cream, and bad stuff happens.&#x201d; I went en pointe. <em>The Cove</em> marked the first of the FBI series, but at that time I had no idea that this book was a kick-off for a series. It simply evolved. Because of its success, Putnam wanted me to drop historical romances and stick to suspense thrillers. No way was that going to happen: I love historicals, the humor, the mysteries, the history, the cat races, for heaven&#x2019;s sake! I struck a deal with my publisher: One historical romance, then one suspense thriller. You said you were a happy camper&#x2014;move over, I&#x2019;m right with you. <br> <br> <strong>Jayne:</strong>There&#x2019;s a bit of a psychic vibe in many of your books. Where does that come from, and why do you like to plot with that element? <br> <br> <strong>Catherine:</strong> People are fascinated with psychic stuff. Just look at TV shows and movies&#x2014;<em>Medium, Ghost Whisperer, The X-Files, Lost</em>, and anything with vampires, like <em>Twilight, The Vampire Diaries</em>. And even <em>Harry Potter</em>. We all love stuff we can&#x2019;t explain, stuff that&#x2019;s different from what&#x2019;s real in our daily lives. From one woo-woo lover to another, ain&#x2019;t it great?! <br> <br> <strong>Jayne:</strong>What is the future of the FBI series? Any plans for firing up a new suspense series? <br> <br> <strong>Catherine:</strong> I&#x2019;m now writing the fifteenth (count &#x2019;em, <em>fifteen</em>) FBI, titled <em>Split Second</em>. That's a whole lot of Savich and Sherlock. My prayer is that I will realize when enough is enough. So far, things still look good. <br> <br> <strong>Jayne:</strong> Did you really grow up on a horse farm in Texas? <br> <br> <strong>Catherine:</strong> Yep, quarter horses. <br> <br> (Photo of Catherine Coulter � Charles Bush) <br> (Photo of Jayne Ann Krentz � Sigrid Estrada)<b>Catherine Coulter</b> is the author of the <i>New York Times</i>- bestselling FBI thrillers <i>The Cove, The Maze, The Target, The Edge, Riptide, Hemlock Bay, Eleventh Hour, Blindside, Blowout, Point Blank, Double Take, TailSpin,</i> and <i>KnockOut</i>.

In the course of this study Anderson vindicates and refines the explanatory power of a Marxist conception of history, whilst casting a fascinating light on Greece, Rome, the Germanic invasion, nomadic society, and the different patterns of the evolution of feudalism in Northern, Mediterranean, Eastern and Western Europe.</p><p><b>Perry Anderson</b> is the author of, among other books, <i>Spectrum, Lineages of the Absolutist State, Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism, Considerations on Western Marxism, English Questions, The Origins of Postmodernity</i>, and <i>The New Old World</i>.

She was naked; he was not. The photograph made her an instant icon of art and sex. Babitz spent the rest of the decade rocking and rolling on the Sunset Strip, honing her notoriety. There were the album covers she designed: for Buffalo Springfield and the Byrds, to name but a few. There were the men she seduced: Jim Morrison, Ed Ruscha, Harrison Ford, to name but a very few.<br> <br> Then, at nearly thirty, her It girl days numbered, Babitz was discovered&#x2014;as a writer&#x2014;by Joan Didion. She would go on to produce seven books, usually billed as novels or short story collections, always autobiographies and confessionals.

Amy's older sister, Lou, leaves her job to come to Heartland to help, and Amy begins to cope with the new circumstances of her life, relying on her work with her beloved horses to help her face the future without her mom.<p> Fans of the Saddle Club, Pine Hollow, and Thoroughbred series of horse novels will enjoy this sensitively told story that combines lots of authentic horse-farm details with Amy's challenges in dealing with her bossy older sister and her mom's sudden death.

Orange groves uprooted for tract houses, people flooding into Orange County, strange new ideas in the air about war, music, sex, and drugs, and new influences, ranging from Richard Nixon to Timothy Leary.</p><p>For the Becker brothers, however, the past is always present -- and it comes crashing back full force when the body of the lovely and mysterious Janelle Vonn is discovered in an abandoned orange-packing plant. The Beckers and the Vonns have a history, beginning years ago in high school with a rumble between the brothers of each clan.</p><p>But boys grow up. Now one Becker brother is a cop on his first homicide case. One's a minister yearning to perform just one miracle. One is a reporter drunk with ambition. And all three are about to collide with the changing world of 1968 as each brother, in his own unique way, tries to find Janelle's killer.</p><p>As suspects multiply and secrets are exposed, the three Becker brothers are drawn further into the case, deeper into the past, and closer to danger.</p></p><p><p>T. Jefferson Parker is the bestselling author of seventeen novels, including the Edgar Award winners <em>California Girl</em> and <em>Silent Joe</em>. Alongside Dick Francis and James Lee Burke, he is one of only three writers who has won the Edgar Award for Best Novel more than once. Parker lives with his family in Southern California.</p>Parker's twelfth novel is a family saga and whodunit set against the turbulent '60s. The Becker brothers grew up among the orange groves of Southern California, brawling and scrapping with the low-class Vonn boys through most of the 1950s. By 1967, Janelle, the tomboyish little sister of the Vonn boys, has grown into a cover-girl beauty with a tragic edge. When her decapitated body is found in an abandoned orange-packing plant, the Becker brothers struggle to find the truth amid conflicting politics and family secrets. Patrick G. Lawlor reads the novel with a precise deliberation that at first seems stiffly at odds with the sunny setting of the story. But as the novel proceeds, Lawlor loosens and the book takes on a life if its own. Dotted with cameos by Richard Nixon, Timothy Leary, and even a young Charles Manson, CALIFORNIA GIRL is a beautiful, moving, and memorable novel.

Did you feel trapped in a "psychological marriage" with this parent? If so, you may be a victim of covert incest.</p> <p>Identification of this kind of incest is difficult, since covert incest victimrs often feel idealized and privileged, not violated and abused. In <i>Silently Seduced</i>, Dr. Adams, through illustrative case examples and perceptive insight, provides covert incest victims a framework to understand what happened to them, how their lives and relationships continue to be affected and how to begin the process of recovery.</p></p><p>Kenneth M. Adams, a licensed psychologist, has worked with children and adults who have grown up in dysfunctional and alcoholic families. He is a national lecturer, workshop leader and consultant in the areas of childhood abuse, adult children and addictions.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br> <i>As long as the child within is not allowed to become aware of what happened to him or her, a part of his or her emotional life will remain frozen ... all appeals to lone, solidarity and compassion will be useless.</i><br><br> &#x2014; Alice Miller, For Your Own Good<br><br> <p>Tom came home from a long day at the office looking forward to the quiet, intimate dinner he and his wife had planned. The telephone rang. It was his mother. Now what? he thought. He listened as she described her day. Eventually she began discussing how lonely and miserable she felt with Tom's father. Tom felt his rage boil but was paralyzed by his guilt. He looked for an opening in her tirade so he could politely excuse himself and eat his dinner which was waiting for him.</p> <p>How do I get out of this one? Tom thought, as his mother went on describing her feelings of sexual dissatisfaction with his father. Impatient and outraged, he paced the floor and hoped his mother would hang up.</p> <p> When she said, "I don't know what I would do if I didn't have you. I wish your father would listen to me like you do,� Tom had had enough. He hung up without a word and threw the phone to the floor in a rage. Teary-eyed, he screamed to his wife, "I don't want to know about her personal problems! I hate it, but I don't know what to do." As had happened so many times before, Tom's evening with his wife was ruined.</p> <p> As a therapist I've learned Tom's story is not unique. Frequently I hear comments such as, "I can't stand it when my dad keeps telling me how much he loves his 'little princess�" or "I wish my mom would stop telling me about her loneliness. It's not my business" or "I know my dad doesn't mean anything by it, but it feels funny when he seems so worried about how I dress and gets jealous when I go out with men." The list is endless, but the theme is the same: a sense of violation and a boundary crossed. These violations are usually done in the name of "love" and "caring.�</p> <p> There is nothing loving or caring about a close parent-child relationship when it services the needs and feelings of the parent rather than the child. "Feeling close" with your parents, particularly the opposite-sex parent, is not the source of comfort the image suggests. It is a relationship in which the individual, both as a child and later as an adult, feels silently seduced by the parent. Feelings of appreciation and gratitude do not prevail in these "close relationships." Instead they are a source of confusing, progressive rage.</p> <p> During the feedback section of my lectures on the subject, some participants are quite vocal with their rage and express relief that they now understand why at times they hate with vengeance the same parent who has always loved them "so much." Some are frozen in their seats and can't speak, while others can't wait to leave. A few courageous parents speak up, expressing that they are now beginning to understand why their sons or daughters struggle in relationships.</p> <p> Others listen to the lectures and insist there is no harm in their close relationship to their opposite-sex parent. Actually they claim to feel special and privileged. These children were given a special position by being idealized by the parent. But there is no privilege in being cheated out of a childhood by being a parent's surrogate partner. As adults these individuals in turn idealize their parents to cover the pain of the abandoned and victimized child within. To be a parent's surrogate partner is to be a victim of covert incest. This book is about the silent seduction covert incest victims experience and its effect on their sexuality, intimacy and relationships.</p> <p> Being a parent's surrogate partner as a child and continuing to be one as an adult has a profound effect on one's life. The following are some common characteristics resulting from the silent seduction of a covertly incestuous relationship. If you find yourself in these descriptions of characteristics, this book is for you.</p> <ol> <li><b>Love/Hate Relationship.</b> One often has intense feelings of both love and hate for the opposite-sex parent. On one hand you feel special and privileged because of the relationship; on the other you frequently feel you aren't doing enough for that parent. This results in feelings of guilt which result in rage that is seldom directly expressed.<br> </li><li><b>Emotional Distance from Same-Sex Parent.</b> In contrast to the love / hate relationship with the opposite-sex parent, you feel abandoned by the same-sex parent. This relationship often is competitive and the parent feels like an adversary. Feeling contempt for this parent is common.<br> </li><li><b>Guilt and Confusion over Personal Needs.</b> You feel guilty about your needs and probably have a difficult time identifying what they are. You generally try to "be strong,� caretake or always "be there" for others as a way of meeting your own needs.<br> </li><li><b>Feelings of Inadequacy.</b> You are likely to have chronic feelings of inadequacy and unworthiness. You believe your worth as a man or woman is determined by what you can do rather than who you are.<br> </li><li><b>Multiple Relationships.</b> You are likely to have been in and out of many relationships and never felt satisfied. You are always on the lookout for the perfect partner or relationship. Establishing intimacy is difficult for you.<br> </li><li><b>Difficulty with Commitment.</b> You generally experience ambivalence regarding commitment in relationships. You always seem to have one foot in and one foot out of the door just in case.<br> </li><li><b>Hasty Commitments.</b> You make a quick commitment to a relationship, then realize later it was not a good choice. You then feel too guilty to leave. Instead you try to make it right.<br> </li><li><b>Regret over Past Relationships.</b> You find yourself looking back at a previous relationship and wondering if it could have worked if you had stuck it out.<br> </li><li><b>Sexual Dysfunction.</b> You find yourself feeling sexually shut down or driven and compulsive in the pursuit of sexual highs or conquests. Sex may become addictive.<br> </li><li><b>Compulsions/Addictions.</b> You have other compulsions or addictions. You are driven in the area of work, success and achievement. You find yourself addicted to food. Either you compulsively overeat, starve yourself or you binge and purge.<br><br></li></ol> <p>�1991. All rights reserved. Reprinted from by Kenneth M.

The tennis party exists for other reasons - and charmingly mannered infidelity is now the most popular pastime in the small but exclusive Devonshire hamlet of Wyvern&#39;s Cross.

Malice Aforethought is a vintage mystery novel of British manners and attitudes. Bruce Montague&#39;s skillful depiction of the male and female characters, their snobbishness and exaggerated accents, is delightful and humorous. The listener learns about the social structures of the time and the pressures that cause people to commit acts they would otherwise never consider. While these pressures might seem insignificant to us now, Montague&#39;s reading gives life to the story and helps the listener understand how important they were to people in the limited social circles of that time.

Mary Jo Sharp shares her journey as a skeptical believer who still holds to a beautiful faith despite wounding experiences in the Christian community.</p><p>At a time when de-conversion stories have become all too common, this is an earnest response - the compelling conversion of an unlikely believer whose questions ultimately led her to irresistible hope. Sharp addresses her own struggle with the reality that God's people repeatedly give God's story a bad name and takes a careful look at how the current church often inadvertently produces atheists despite its life-giving message.</p><p>For those who feel the ever-present tension between the beauty of salvation and the dark side of human nature, <em>Why I Still Believe</em> is a candid and approachable case for believing in God when you really want to walk away. With fresh and thoughtful insights, this spiritual narrative presents relevant answers to haunting questions like:</p><ul><li>Isn't there too much pain and suffering to believe?</li><li>Is it okay to have doubt?</li><li>What if Jesus' story is a copy of another story?</li><li>Is there any evidence for Jesus' resurrection?</li><li>Does atheism explain the human experience better than Christianity can? &nbsp;</li><li>How can the truth of Christianity matter when the behaviors of Christians are reprehensible?</li></ul><p>At once logical and loving, Sharp reframes the gospel as it truly is: the good news of redemption. With firmly grounded truths, <em>Why I Still Believe </em>is an affirming reminder that the hypocrisy of Christians can never negate the transforming grace and truth of Christ.</p></p><p><p>A former atheist who came to faith, Mary Jo has experienced two worlds of American culture: the post-Christian culture of the Pacific Northwest and the evangelical culture of the Bible Belt.

By the author of The October Horse. 125,000 first printing.</p><p>Colleen McCullough was born in Australia.

Whenever possible he concentrated upon what he did best, namely to advise his superiors so subtly that they came to believe the ideas were genuinely theirs.</p><p>So after Philippi, in which conflict he had neither distinguished himself nor displeased his commanders, Dellius decided to attach his meager person to Mark Antony and go east.</p><p>It was never possible, Dellius reflected, to choose Rome; it always boiled down to choosing sides in the massive, convulsive struggles between men determined to control -- no, be honest, Quintus Dellius! -- determined to rule Rome. With the murder of Caesar by Brutus, Cassius, and the rest, everyone had assumed that Caesar's close cousin Mark Antony would inherit his name, his fortune, and his literal millions of clients. But what had Caesar done? Made a last will and testament that left everything to his eighteen-year-old greatnephew, Gaius Octavius! He hadn't even mentioned Antony in that document, a blow from which Antony had never really recovered, so sure had he been that he would step into Caesar's high red boots. And, typical Antony, he had made no plans to take second place. At first the youth everyone now called Octavian hadn't worried him; Antony was a man in his prime, a famous general of troops and owner of a large faction in the Senate, whereas Octavian was a sickly adolescent as easy to crush as the carapace of a beetle. Only it hadn't worked out that way, and Antony hadn't known how to deal with a crafty, sweet-faced boy owning the intellect and wisdom of a seventy-year-old. Most of Rome had assumed that Antony, a notorious spendthrift in desperate need of Caesar's fortune to pay his debts, had been a part of the conspiracy to eliminate Caesar, and his conduct following the deed had only reinforced that. He made no attempt to punish the assassins; rather, he had virtually given them the full protection of the law. But Octavian, passionately attached to Caesar, had gradually eroded Antony's authority and forced him to outlaw them. How had he done that? By suborning a good percentage of Antony's legions to his own cause, winning over the people of Rome, and stealing the thirty thousand talents of Caesar's war chest so brilliantly that no one, even Antony, had managed to prove that Octavian was the thief. Once Octavian had soldiers and money, he gave Antony no choice but to admit him into power as a full equal. After that, Brutus and Cassius made their own bid for power; uneasy allies, Antony and Octavian had taken their legions to Macedonia and met the forces of Brutus and Cassius at Philippi. A great victory for Antony and Octavian that hadn't solved the vexed question of who would end in ruling as the First Man in Rome, an uncrowned king paying lip service to the hallowed illusion that Rome was a republic, governed by an upper house, the Senate, and several Assemblies of the People. Together, the Senate and People of Rome: <i>senatus populusque Romanus</i>, SPQR.</p><p>Typically, Dellius's thoughts meandered on, victory at Philippi had found Mark Antony without a viable strategy to put Octavian out of the power equation, for Antony was a force of Nature, lusty, impulsive, hot-tempered, and quite lacking foresight. His personal magnetism was great, of that kind which draws men by virtue of the most masculine qualities: courage, an Herculean physique, a well-deserved reputation as a lover of women, and enough brain to make him a formidable orator in the House. His weaknesses tended to be excused, for they were equally masculine: the pleasures of the flesh, and heedless generosity.</p><p>His answer to the problem of Octavian was to divide the Roman world between them, with a sop thrown to Marcus Lepidus, high priest and owner of a large senatorial faction. Sixty years of on-again, off-again civil war had finally bankrupted Rome, whose people -- and the people of Italia -- groaned under poor incomes, shortages of wheat for bread, and a growing conviction that the betters who ruled them were as incompetent as venal. Unwilling to see his status as a popular hero undermined, Antony resolved that he would take the lion's share, leave the rotting carcass to that jackal Octavian.</p><p>So after Philippi the victors had carved up the provinces to suit Antony, not Octavian, who inherited the least enviable parts: Rome, Italia, and the big islands of Sicilia, Sardinia, and Corsica, where the wheat was grown to feed the peoples of Italia, long since incapable of feeding themselves. It was a tactic in keeping with Antony's character, ensuring that the only face Rome and Italia saw would belong to Octavian, while his own glorious deeds elsewhere were assiduously circulated throughout Rome and Italia. Octavian to collect the odium, himself the stout-hearted winner of laurels far from the center of government. As for Lepidus, he had charge of the other wheat province, Africa, a genuine backwater.</p><p>Ah, but Marcus Antonius did indeed have the lion's share! Not only of the provinces, but of the legions. All he lacked was money, which he expected to squeeze out of that perennial golden fowl, the East. Of course he had taken all three of the Gauls for himself; though in the West, they were thoroughly pacifi ed by Caesar, and rich enough to contribute funds for his coming campaigns. His trusted marshals commanded Gaul's legions, of which there were many; Gaul could live without his presence.</p><p>Caesar had been killed within three days of setting out for the East, where he had intended to conquer the fabulously rich and formidable Kingdom of the Parthians, using its plunder to set Rome on her feet again. He had planned to be away for five years, and had planned his campaign with all his legendary genius. So now, with Caesar dead, it would be Marcus Antonius -- Mark Antony -- who conquered the Parthians and set Rome upon her feet again. Antony had conned Caesar's plans and decided that they showed all the old boy's brilliance, but that he himself could improve on them. One of the reasons why he had come to this conclusion lay in the nature of the group of men who went east with him; every last one of them was a crawler, a sucker-up, and knew exactly how to play that biggest of fish, Mark Antony, so susceptible to praise and flattery.</p><p>Unfortunately, Quintus Dellius did not yet have Antony's ear, though his advice would have been equally flattering, balm to Antony's ego. So, riding down the Via Egnatia on a galled and grumpy pony, his balls bruised and his unsupported legs aching, Quintus Dellius waited his chance, which still hadn't come when Antony crossed into Asia and stopped in Nicomedia, the capital of his province of Bithynia.</p><p>Somehow every potentate and client-king Rome owned in the East had sensed that the great Marcus Antonius would head for Nicomedia, and scuttled there in dozens, commandeering the best inns or setting up camp in style on the city's outskirts. A beautiful place on its dreamy placid inlet, a place that most people had forgotten lay very close to dead Caesar's heart. But because it had, Nicomedia still looked prosperous, for Caesar had exempted it from taxes, and Brutus and Cassius, hurrying west to Macedonia, had not ventured north enough to rape it the way they had raped a hundred cities from Judaea to Thrace. Thus the pink and purple marble palace in which Antony took up residence was able to offer legates like Dellius a tiny room in which to stow his luggage and the senior among his servants, his freedman Icarus. That done, Dellius sallied forth to see what was going on, and work out how he was going to snaffl e a place on a couch close enough to Antony to participate in the Great Man's conversation during dinner.</p><p>Kings aplenty thronged the public halls, ashen-pale, hearts palpitating because they had backed Brutus and Cassius. Even old King Deiotarus of Galatia, senior in age and years of service, had made the effort to come, escorted by the two among his sons whom Dellius presumed were his favorites. Antony's bosom friend Poplicola had pointed out Deiotarus to him, but after that Poplicola admitted himself at a loss -- too many faces, not enough service in the East to recognize them.</p><p>Smilingly demure, Dellius moved among the groups in their outlandish apparel, eyes glistening at the size of an emerald or the weight of gold upon a coiffed head. Of course he had good Greek, so Dellius was able to converse with these absolute rulers of places and peoples, his smile growing wider at the thought that, despite the emeralds and the gold, every last one of them was here to pay obsequious homage to Rome, their ultimate ruler. Rome, which had no king, whose senior magistrates wore a simple, purple-bordered white toga and prized the iron ring of some senators over a ton of gold rings; an iron ring meant that a Roman family had been in and out of offi ce for five hundred years. A thought that made poor Dellius automatically hide his gold senatorial ring in a fold of toga; no Dellius had yet reached the consulship, no Dellius had been prominent a <i>hundred</i> years ago, let alone five. Caesar had worn an iron ring, but Antony did not; the Antonii were not quite antique enough. And Caesar's iron ring had gone to Octavian.</p><p>Oh, air, air! He needed fresh air!</p><p>The palace was built around a huge peristyle garden that had a fountain at its middle athwart a long, shallow pool. It was fashioned of pure white Parian marble in a fishy theme -- mermen, tritons, dolphins -- and it was rare in that it had never been painted to imitate real life's colors. Whoever had sculpted its glorious creatures had been a master; a connoisseur of fine art, Dellius gravitated to the fountain so quickly that he failed to notice that someone had beaten him to it, was sitting in a dejected huddle on its broad rim. As Dellius neared, the fellow lifted his head; no chance of avoiding a meeting now.</p><p>He was a foreigner, and a noble one, for he wore an expensive robe of Tyrian purple brocade artfully interwoven with gold thread, and upon a head of snakelike, greasy black curls sat a skullcap made of cloth-of-gold. Dellius had seen e...</p></p><h2>Faerie Tale</h2><p>Phil Hastings was a lucky man-he had money, a growing reputation as a screenwriter, a happy, loving family with three kids, and he'd just moved into the house of his dreams in rural of magic-and about to be altered irrevocably by a magic more real than any he dared imagine.

It was my way of saying good-bye to them. And when I wasn&#x2019;t with them, I was fending off all the women who propositioned me. Everywhere I&#x2019;d go, there were some women who would come up to me and say, &#x201c;Come on, I&#x2019;m not going to say that you raped me. You can come with me. I&#x2019;ll let you film it.&#x201d; I later realized that that was their way of saying &#x201c;We know you didn&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d; But I didn&#x2019;t take it that way. I&#x2019;d strike back indignantly with a rude response. Although they were saying what they said out of support, I was in too much pain to realize it. I was an ignorant, mad, bitter guy who had a lot of growing up to do.</p><p>But some of my anger was understandable. I was a twenty-five-year-old kid facing sixty years in jail for a crime that I did not commit. Let me repeat here what I said before the grand jury, during the trial, at my sentencing, at my early-release hearing, after I got out of prison, and what I will continue to say until they put me in the ground. I did not rape Desiree Washington. She knows it, God knows it, and the consequences of her actions are something that she&#x2019;s got to live with for the rest of her life.</p><p>My promoter, Don King, kept assuring me that I would walk from these charges. He told me he was working behind the scenes to make the case disappear. Plus, he had hired Vince Fuller, the best lawyer that a million-dollar fee could buy. Vince just happened to be Don&#x2019;s tax attorney. And Don probably still owed him money. But I knew from the start that I&#x2019;d get no justice. I wasn&#x2019;t being tried in New York or Los Angeles; we were in Indianapolis, Indiana, historically one of the strongholds of the Ku Klux Klan. My judge, Patricia Gifford, was a former sex crimes prosecutor and was known as &#x201c;the Hanging Judge.&#x201d; I had been found guilty by a jury of my &#x201c;peers,&#x201d; only two of whom were black. Another black jury member had been excused by the judge after a fire in the hotel where the jurors were staying. She dismissed him because of his &#x201c;state of mind.&#x201d; Yeah, his state of mind was that he didn&#x2019;t like the food he was being served.</p><p>But in my mind, I had no peers. I was the youngest heavyweight champion in the history of boxing. I was a titan, the reincarnation of Alexander the Great. My style was impetuous, my defenses were impregnable, and I was ferocious. It&#x2019;s amazing how a low self-esteem and a huge ego can give you delusions of grandeur. But after the trial, this god among men had to get his black ass back in court for his sentencing.</p><p>But first I tried some divine intervention. Calvin, my close friend from Chicago, told me about some hoodoo woman who could cast a spell to keep me out of jail.</p><p>&#x201c;You piss in a jar, then put five hundred-dollar bills in there, then put the jar under your bed for three days and then bring it to her and she&#x2019;ll pray over it for you,&#x201d; Calvin told me.</p><p>&#x201c;So the clairvoyant broad is gonna take the pissy pile of hundreds out of the jar, rinse them off, and then go shopping. If somebody gave you a hundred-dollar bill they pissed on, would you care?&#x201d; I asked Calvin. I had a reputation for throwing around money but that was too much even for me.</p><p>Then some friends tried to set me up with a voodoo priest. But they brought around this guy who had a suit on. The guy didn&#x2019;t even look like a drugstore voodoo guy. This asshole needed to be in the swamp; he needed to have on a dashiki. I knew that guy had nothing. He didn&#x2019;t even have a ceremony planned. He just wrote some shit on a piece of paper and tried to sell me on some bullshit I didn&#x2019;t do. He wanted me to wash in some weird oil and pray and drink some special water. But I was drinking goddamn Hennessy. I wasn&#x2019;t going to water down my Hennessy.</p><p>So I settled on getting a Santeria priest to do some witch doctor shit. We went to the courthouse one night with a pigeon and an egg. I dropped the egg on the ground as the bird was released and I yelled, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re free!&#x201d; A few days later, I put on my gray pin-striped suit and went to court.</p><p>After the verdict had been delivered, my defense team had put together a presentence memorandum on my behalf. It was an impressive document. Dr. Jerome Miller, the clinical director of the Augustus Institute in Virginia and one of the nation&#x2019;s leading experts on adult sex offenders, had examined me and concluded that I was &#x201c;a sensitive and thoughtful young man with problems more the result of developmental deficits than of pathology.&#x201d; With regular psychotherapy, he was convinced that my long-term prognosis would be quite good. He concluded, &#x201c;A term in prison will delay the process further and more likely set it back. I would strongly recommend that other options with both deterrent and treatment potential be considered.&#x201d; Of course, the probation officers who put together their sentencing document left that last paragraph out of their summary. But they were eager to include the prosecution&#x2019;s opinion, &#x201c;An assessment of this offense and this offender leads the chief investigator of this case, an experienced sex crimes detective, to conclude that the defendant is inclined to commit a similar offense in the future.&#x201d;</p><p>My lawyers prepared an appendix that contained forty-eight testimonials to my character from such diverse people as my high school principal, my social worker in upstate New York, Sugar Ray Robinson&#x2019;s widow, my adoptive mother, Camille, my boxing hypnotherapist, and six of my girlfriends (and their mothers), who all wrote moving accounts of how I had been a perfect gentleman with them. One of my first girlfriends from Catskill even wrote the judge, &#x201c;I waited three years before having sexual intercourse with Mr. Tyson and not once did he force me into anything. That is the reason I love him, because he loves and respects women.&#x201d;</p><p>But of course, Don being Don, he had to go and overdo it. King had the Reverend William F. Crockett, the Imperial First Ceremonial Master of the Ancient Egyptian Arabic Order Nobles Mystic Shrine of North and South America, write a letter on my behalf. The Reverend wrote, &#x201c;I beseech you to spare him incarceration. Though I have not spoken to Mike since the day of his trial, my information is that he no longer uses profanity or vulgarity, reads the Bible daily, prays and trains.&#x201d; Of course, that was all bullshit. He didn&#x2019;t even know me.</p><p>Then there was Don&#x2019;s personal heartfelt letter to the judge. You would have thought that I had come up with a cure for cancer, had a plan for peace in the Middle East, and nursed sick kittens back to health. He talked about my work with the Make-A-Wish Foundation visiting with sick kids. He informed Judge Gifford that every Thanksgiving we gave away forty thousand turkeys to the needy and the hungry. He recounted the time we met with Simon Wiesenthal and I was so moved that I donated a large sum of money to help him hunt down Nazi war criminals. I guess Don forgot that the Klan hated Jews as much as they hated blacks.</p><p>This went on for eight pages, with Don waxing eloquently about me. &#x201c;It is highly unusual for a person his age to be concerned about his fellow man, let alone with the deep sense of commitment and dedication that he possesses. These are God-like qualities, noble qualities of loving, giving and unselfishness. He is a child of God: one of the most gentle, sensitive, caring, loving, and understanding persons that I have ever met in my twenty years&#x2019; experience with boxers.&#x201d; Shit, Don should have delivered the closing arguments instead of my lawyer. But John Solberg, Don&#x2019;s public relations man, cut right to the chase in his letter to Judge Gifford. &#x201c;Mike Tyson is not a scumbag,&#x201d; he wrote.</p><p>I might not have been a scumbag, but I was an arrogant prick. I was so arrogant in the courtroom during the trial that there was no way they were going to give me a break. Even in my moment of doom, I was not a humble person. All those things they wrote about in that report&#x2014;giving people money and turkeys, taking care of people, looking out for the weak and the infirm&#x2014;I did all those things because I <i>wanted</i> to be that humble person, not because I <i>was</i> that person. I wanted so desperately to be humble but there wasn&#x2019;t a humble bone in my body.</p><p>So, armed with all my character testimonials, we appeared in Judge Patricia Gifford&#x2019;s court on March 26, 1992, for my sentencing. Witnesses were permitted and Vince Fuller began the process by calling to the stand Lloyd Bridges, the executive director of the Riverside Residential Center in Indianapolis. My defense team was arguing that instead of jail time, my sentence should be suspended and I should serve my probation term at a halfway house where I could combine personal therapy with community service. Bridges, an ordained minister, ran just such a program and he testified that I would certainly be a prime candidate for his facility.</p><p>But the assistant prosecutor got Bridges to reveal that there had been four escapes recently from his halfway house. And when she got the minister to admit that he had interviewed me in my mansion in Ohio and that we had paid for his airfare, that idea was dead in the water. So now it was only a matter of how much time the Hanging Judge would give me.</p><p>Fuller approached the bench. It was time for him to weave his million-dollar magic. Instead, I got his usual two-bit bullshit. &#x201c;Tyson came in with a lot of excess baggage. The press has vilified him. Not a day goes by that the press doesn&#x2019;t bring up his faults. This is not the Tyson I know. The Tyson I know is a sensitive, thoughtful, caring man. He may be terrifying in the ring, but that ends when he leaves the ring.&#x201d; Now, this was nowhere near Don King hyperbole, but it wasn&#x2019;t bad. Except that Fuller had just spent the whole trial portraying me as a savage animal, a crude bore, bent solely on sexual satisfaction.</p><p>Then Fuller changed the subject to my poverty-stricken childhood and my adoption by the legendary boxing trainer Cus D&#x2019;Amato.</p><p>&#x201c;But there is some tragedy in this,&#x201d; he intoned. &#x201c;D&#x2019;Amato only focused on boxing. Tyson, the man, was secondary to Cus D&#x2019;Amato&#x2019;s quest for Tyson&#x2019;s boxing greatness.&#x201d; Camille, who was Cus&#x2019;s companion for many years, was outraged at his statement. It was like Fuller was pissing on the grave of Cus, my mentor. Fuller went on and on, but he was as disjointed as he had been for the entire trial.</p><p>Now it was my time to address the court. I got up and stood behind the podium. I really hadn&#x2019;t been prepared properly and I didn&#x2019;t even have any notes. But I did have that stupid voodoo guy&#x2019;s piece of paper in my hand. And I knew one thing&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t going to apologize for what went on in my hotel room that night. I apologized to the press, the court, and the other contestants of the Miss Black America pageant, where I met Desiree, but not for my actions in my room.</p><p>&#x201c;My conduct was kind of crass. I agree with that. I didn&#x2019;t rape anyone. I didn&#x2019;t attempt to rape anyone. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; Then I looked back at Greg Garrison, the prosecutor, or persecutor in my case.</p><p>&#x201c;My personal life has been incarcerated. I&#x2019;ve been hurt. This was all one big dream. I didn&#x2019;t come here to beg you for mercy, ma&#x2019;am. I expect the worst. I&#x2019;ve been crucified. I&#x2019;ve been humiliated worldwide. I&#x2019;ve been humiliated socially. I&#x2019;m just happy for all my support. I&#x2019;m prepared to deal with whatever you give me.&#x201d;</p><p>I sat back down behind the defense table and the judge asked me a few questions about being a role model for kids. &#x201c;I was never taught how to handle my celebrity status. I don&#x2019;t tell kids it&#x2019;s right to be Mike Tyson. Parents serve as better role models.&#x201d;</p><p>Now the prosecution had their say. Instead of the redneck Garrison, who argued against me during the trial, his boss, Jeffrey Modisett, the Marion County prosecutor, stepped up. He went on for ten minutes saying that males with money and fame shouldn&#x2019;t get special privileges. Then he read from a letter from Desiree Washington. &#x201c;In the early morning hours of July 19, 1991, an attack on both my body and my mind occurred. I was physically defeated to the point that my innermost person was taken away. In the place of what has been me for eighteen years is now a cold and empty feeling. I am not able to comment on what my future will be. I can only say that each day after being raped has been a struggle to learn to trust again, to smile the way I did and to find the Desiree Lynn Washington who was stolen from me and those who loved me on July 19, 1991. On those occasions when I became angry about the pain that my attacker caused me, God granted me the wisdom to see that he was psychologically ill. Although some days I cry when I see the pain in my own eyes, I am also able to pity my attacker. It has been and still is my wish that he be rehabilitated.&#x201d;</p><p>Modisett put the letter down. &#x201c;From the date of his conviction, Tyson still doesn&#x2019;t get it. The world is watching now to see if there is one system of justice. It is his responsibility to admit his problem. Heal this sick man. Mike Tyson, the rapist, needs to be off the streets.&#x201d; And then he recommended I do eight to ten years of healing behind bars.</p><p>It was Jim Voyles&#x2019;s turn to speak on my behalf. Voyles was the local attorney hired by Fuller to act as local counsel. He was a great guy, compassionate, smart, and funny. He was the only attorney from my side that I related to. Besides all that, he was a friend of Judge Gifford&#x2019;s and a down-home guy who could appeal to the Indianapolis jury. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go with this guy,&#x201d; I told Don at the beginning of my trial. Voyles would have gotten me some play. But Don and Fuller made a fool out of him. They didn&#x2019;t let him do anything. They shut him down. Jim was frustrated too. He described his role to one friend as &#x201c;one of the world&#x2019;s highest-paid pencil carriers.&#x201d; But now he was finally arguing in court. He spoke passionately for rehabilitation instead of incarceration but it fell on deaf ears. Judge Gifford was ready to make her decision.</p><p>She began by complimenting me on my community work and my treatment of children and my &#x201c;sharing&#x201d; of &#x201c;assets.&#x201d; But then she went into a rant about &#x201c;date rape,&#x201d; saying it was a term she detested. &#x201c;We have managed to imply that it is all right to proceed to do what you want to do if you know or are dating a woman. The law is very clear in its definition of rape. It never mentions anything about whether the defendant and victim are related. The &#x2018;date,&#x2019; in date rape, does not lessen the fact that it is still rape.&#x201d;</p><p>My mind was wandering during this lecture. It really had nothing to do with me. We weren&#x2019;t on a date; it was, as the great comedian Bill Bellamy would say, a booty call. Enough said. But then I snapped back to attention.</p><p>&#x201c;I feel he is at risk to do it again because of his attitude,&#x201d; the judge said and stared at me. &#x201c;You had no prior record. You have been given many gifts. But you have stumbled.&#x201d; She paused.</p><p>&#x201c;On count one, I sentence you to ten years,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Fucking bitch,&#x201d; I mumbled under my breath. I started to feel numb. That was the rape count. <i>Shit, maybe I should have drank that special voodoo water,</i> I thought.</p><p>&#x201c;On count two, I sentence you to ten years.&#x201d; Don King and my friends in...</p></p><h2>Sleepy Squirrel (Golden Books)</h2><p>A lively squirrel falls asleep after her father reads a bedtime story.

Hazen reveals how the co-evolution of the geosphere and biosphere&#x2014;of rocks and living matter&#x2014;has shaped our planet into the only one of its kind in the Solar System, if not the entire cosmos.<br></p><p>With an astrobiologist&#x2019;s imagination, a historian&#x2019;s perspective, and a naturalist&#x2019;s passion for the ground beneath our feet, Hazen explains how changes on an atomic level translate into dramatic shifts in Earth&#x2019;s makeup over its 4.567 billion year existence. He calls upon a flurry of recent discoveries to portray our planet&#x2019;s many iterations in vivid detail&#x2014;from its fast-rotating infancy when the Sun rose every five hours and the Moon filled 250 times more sky than it does now, to its sea-bathed youth before the first continents arose; from the Great Oxidation Event that turned the land red, to the globe-altering volcanism that may have been the true killer of the dinosaurs. Through Hazen&#x2019;s theory of &#x201c;co-evolution,&#x201d; we learn how reactions between organic molecules and rock crystals may have generated Earth&#x2019;s first organisms, which in turn are responsible for more than two-thirds of the mineral varieties on the planet&#x2014;thousands of different kinds of crystals that could not exist in a nonliving world.<br></p><p><i>The Story of Earth</i> is also the story of the pioneering men and women behind the sciences. Readers will meet black-market meteorite hawkers of the Sahara Desert, the gun-toting Feds who guarded the Apollo missions&#x2019; lunar dust, and the World War II Navy officer whose super-pressurized &#x201c;bomb&#x201d;&#x2014;recycled from military hardware&#x2014;first simulated the molten rock of Earth&#x2019;s mantle. As a mentor to a new generation of scientists, Hazen introduces the intrepid young explorers whose dispatches from Earth&#x2019;s harshest landscapes will revolutionize geology.<br></p><p>Celebrated by the New York Times for writing &#x201c;with wonderful clarity about science . . . that effortlessly teaches as it zips along,&#x201d; Hazen proves a brilliant and entertaining guide on this grand tour of our planet inside and out.

Icy fingers of unease continually crept down her spine. There was no relaxing, not even with a drink in front of her and the pounding beat of the music calling.<br><br> "We know they followed us here, Genevieve," she whispered behind her hand. Whispering in the dance club with the music drumming out a wild rhythm wasn't easy, but she managed. They had accomplished what they set out to do, but now that they had drawn their three stalkers out into the open, what were they going to do?<br><br> "We must have been crazy thinking we could do this, Genevieve. Because we have no business exposing ourselves to this kind of danger." Mostly, Charlotte didn't think she should have exposed Genevieve to the danger. At least not when they were together. Not when they had a three-year-old to consider.<br><br> She took a slow perusal of the club, trying to take in every detail. The Palace was the hottest dance club in the city. Everyone who was anyone went there. In spite of the fact that it was four stories tall, every single floor was packed with bodies, as was the basement underground club. Men tried to catch her eye continually. She wasn't going to pretend she didn't know Genevieve was beautiful, or that she wasn't so hard on the eyes, either. The pair of them together drew attention everywhere they went-which was a bad thing.<br><br> "We're acting like normal women for a change," Genevieve said a little defiantly. "I'm tired of hiding. We needed to get out of the house. You needed to get out of the house. You work all the time. Honestly, Charlie, we're going to grow old hiding away. What good has it done us? We're not any closer to finding out who is doing this to us."<br><br> "I can't afford to be bait," Charlotte pointed out. "And I don't like you being bait, either. Certainly not both of us together when we have to look after Lourdes. She can't lose everyone in her life. It goes against everything in me to hide away, but I've got to consider what would happen to her if I was killed. They already murdered her father. She has no mother. I'm all she's got." When Genevieve sent her a look, she hastily amended, "We're all she's got."<br><br> Charlotte wasn't the hide-from-an-enemy type any more than Genevieve was. They'd met in France, both studying art. Genevieve painted, and she was good. More than good. Already her landscapes and portraits were beginning to be noticed, sought after by collectors. Charlotte restored old paintings as well as old carvings. Her specialty and greatest passion was restoring old carousels.<br><br> Genevieve was French. She was tall, with long, glossy dark hair and large green eyes. Not just green, but deep forest green. Startling green. She had the figure of a model and in fact had had several major agencies try to convince her to sign with them. She was independently wealthy, having received inheritances from her parents and both sets of grandparents.<br><br> Genevieve's maternal grandmother had raised her. A few months earlier, that grandmother, her last living relative, had been brutally murdered. A few weeks later a man Genevieve had been dating was murdered in the same way. His blood had been drained from his body, and his throat had been torn out. Charlotte's mentor, the man she was apprenticing under, was murdered a week after that.<br><br> Twice, when they were together, the two women had become aware of someone trying to enter their house late at night. They'd locked all the windows and doors, but whoever was after them had been persistent, rattling the glass, shaking the heavy doors, terrorizing them. The police had been called. Two officers were found dead in the courtyard, both with their blood drained and their throats torn out.<br><br> Charlotte received word a couple of weeks later that her only sibling, her brother, had been found dead, murdered in the same way. He was in California. In the United States. Far from France. Far from her. He left behind his business and his daughter, three-year-old Lourdes. Lourdes's mother had died in childbirth, leaving Charlotte's brother to raise her. Now it was up to Charlotte. Genevieve had decided to come with Charlotte to California. Whoever was after the two of them was in the States and Genevieve wanted to find them.<br><br> Genevieve laid her hand over Charlotte's. "I know Lourdes is your first priority. She's mine as well. She's a beautiful little girl and obviously traumatized by what she saw. Her nightmares wake me up and I'm not even in the same house."<br><br> Charlotte knew Genevieve wasn't exaggerating. Genevieve always knew whenever Lourdes had nightmares, even if she wasn't staying with them. At those times, she always called to make certain the child was all right. Lourdes had been present when her father was murdered. The killer had left the child alive and sitting beside her slain father. She'd been alone in the house with his body for several hours before she was found by her nanny, Grace Parducci, a woman who had gone to school with Charlotte and had known her brother and his wife.<br><br> "The police aren't any closer to solving the murders, Charlie. Not here and not in France. Lourdes is in danger just as much as we are. Maybe more." Genevieve leaned her chin on the heel of her hand as she hitched her chair closer to Charlotte's in order to be heard above the music. "I've been thinking a lot about this and how it all got started. What we did to draw some crazy person's attention."<br><br> Charlotte nodded. She'd been thinking about it as well. What else could she think about? Both of them had lost every family member with the exception of little Lourdes. Charlotte didn't want to lose her, and lately, in spite of taking every precaution, she hadn't felt safe. At. All. Grace had reported being followed and feeling as though someone was watching her as well.<br><br> Charlotte knew there was a part of her that had come with Genevieve to the nightclub in an effort to try to draw the murderer out. She'd certainly come prepared. She had weapons on her. Several. Most were unconventional, but she had them. She honestly didn't know if the people stalking them were the same ones who had murdered her brother, but it seemed likely.<br><br> Charlotte wasn't the type of woman to run from her enemies and it upset her to think her brother's murderer was going free-that he or she was trying to terrorize them. Not trying-she was terrified for Lourdes. She had no idea why the little girl had been left alive, but she wasn't taking any chances with her. Coming to the nightclub without her was a chance to draw the killer out without endangering her.<br><br> "That stupid psychic center we went to together for testing," Charlotte murmured. "It gave me the creeps."<br><br> Genevieve nodded. "Exactly. The Morrison Center. We went for a lark, but it wasn't the least bit fun. They got interested in us way too fast and kept asking very personal questions. When we left, I thought we were followed."<br><br> Charlotte had thought so as well. The testing site had been a little hole-in-the-wall, but in a high-traffic area, so neither had thought anything of it. They both often said they were psychic, and thought it would be so much fun to go in and test it, just like having their palms read. Something fun to do. It hadn't turned out to be very fun.<br><br> Charlotte looked into Genevieve's green eyes and saw the same pain she was feeling reflected there. Who knew that something they'd done on a whim would have such horrific consequences? It was like that with them. They both thought along the same lines, knew what the other was thinking.<br><br> "Ever since going there, I feel like we're being watched," Genevieve said. "And not in a good way. When we were still in France, before Grand-m�re was murdered, a couple of men asked me out and I got this really creepy vibe from them. When they talked I just kept having the image of the testing center crop up in my mind and I couldn't help associating them with it."<br><br> Charlotte nodded her understanding. The same thing had happened to her more than once. And then the murders happened. Since then, they'd been much more careful. No dates. No fun. No strangers in their lives. Charlotte ran her brother's cabinetmaking business, and she did a little art restoration on the side, but she hadn't really been working at her own business for months. Not since she'd returned to the United States.<br><br> "What are we going to do, Charlie?" Genevieve asked. "I can't live like this for much longer. I know I should be grateful I'm alive, that we're alive, and I don't want to do anything that might endanger Lourdes, but I feel like I'm suffocating."<br><br> Charlotte knew how she felt. "We've taken the first step by coming here. We weren't all that quiet about it, either, Vi. We've attracted a lot of attention. Those men, the ones who keep asking us to dance-they give off that creepy testing vibe to me. What about you? And do they look familiar to you? I swear I've seen them before. I think in France."<br><br> Genevieve followed Charlotte's gaze to the three men who had continuously asked them to dance and sent drinks to their table. They'd winked and flirted and stayed close all night. They were good dancers; they'd asked other women and Charlotte had watched them. All three men knew what they were doing on the dance floor. All three were exceptionally good-looking. They seemed like men who frequented the dance club and picked up their share of women there. Still, there was something off about them.<br><br> "Same here. The one named Vince, Vince Tidwell, touches me with one finger every time he gets close enough. He just runs it over my skin. Instead of giving me any kind of cool shiver, it gives me the creeps, and the image of the testing center is right there in my mind. I keep telling myself we tested in France, so would they really follow us here? But I'm fairly certain they did."<br><br> "So maybe we should leave and then wait for them outside and try to follow them," Charlotte suggested. "Lourdes is safe for tonight. I've called half a dozen times, and Grace assures me all is quiet on the home front. We could track them tonight and find out where they're staying and who they really are. Maybe we'll find out what they want from us."<br><br> Genevieve's vivid green eyes lit up. "Absolutely. I need to do something to make me feel like I'm not sitting on my hands, just waiting for someone to murder me. I have to do something positive to help myself."<br><br> Charlotte nodded. She knew better. She had Lourdes. Responsibilities. One huge responsibility. She'd always been adventuresome. She pursued her dreams with wide-open arms, rushing headlong where others were afraid to go. She hadn't stayed home with her brother. She worked hard from the time she was very young so she could finance her trip to France, where she'd always wanted to go. She learned French early and worked hard at it until she could speak like a native. She'd left behind her brother and come back only to help him when his wife died. And then she left again.<br><br> "Selfish," she murmured aloud. "I've always been selfish, doing the things I wanted to do. I want to go after them, too, Vi. I swear I do." She had to put her mouth close to Genevieve's ear to be heard over the music. She wasn't the type of woman to hide in a house with the covers over her head, but what was the right thing to do? She honestly didn't know.<br><br> "Lourdes would be a lot safer if we figured this out, Charlie," Genevieve pointed out.<br><br> She wasn't saying anything Charlotte hadn't already told herself, but Charlotte still didn't know if she herself was making excuses to jump into action because she wanted to justify taking the fight and shoving it right down the throat of their enemy.<br><br> Charlotte made up her mind. She couldn't just keep hiding. It wasn't in her character and Genevieve was so right-Lourdes needed to settle into a normal life. They couldn't keep moving and trying to cover their tracks. "Let's do it, then, Vi. We can follow them and see if we can find out what they're up to. You can't look like you, though. You draw way too much attention."<br><br> Charlotte risked another quick glance at the three men. The one named Daniel Forester appeared to be the leader. His two friends definitely deferred to him. He was tall and good-looking and he knew it. He was staring at her even as he danced with another woman. The woman looked up at him with absolute worship, and he was ignoring her to stare at Charlie.<br><br> She raised an eyebrow at him to let him know she thought he was being rude. He grinned at her as if they shared a secret. "He is an arrogant prick," she hissed.<br><br> "So are his friends. Players. All three of them," Genevieve said. "They know they look good and they use their appearances to pick up women."<br><br> Charlotte couldn't help it; she laughed softly, breaking the stare with Daniel to regard her best friend. Genevieve was in full makeup and looked like a runway model. "Seriously? We're really getting bad here, Vi. We both know we look good and we came here hoping for a little fun."<br><br> "I don't know what you're talking about, Charlie," Genevieve protested haughtily. "I look like this all the time. Waking up, I look like this."<br><br> Charlotte blew her a kiss. "Truthfully, you do look like that when you wake up. It makes me sick."<br><br> "Uh-oh, here they come. They're bringing drinks. Vince and his friend Bruce at your nine o'clock. They're carrying one for their friend Daniel as well," Genevieve lowered her voice until Charlotte could barely make out what she was saying over the music.<br><br> Both women plastered on smiles as the two men toed chairs around and sat at their table without asking.<br><br> "I know you must have missed us," Bruce Van Hues said. "So we came bearing gifts." He put the drinks down in front of them, flashing them smiles as if that would convince them he was merely joking.<br><br> "Pined away," Charlotte said. "Could hardly breathe without you."<br><br> Vince laughed, nudging Genevieve playfully with his shoulder before pulling his chair very close to hers, making a show of claiming her. Charlotte saw Genevieve's eyes darken from her normal vivid, emerald green to a much deeper forest green, like moss after a rain. That was always, always a bad sign with her best friend. Genevieve had a bit of a temper. She flashed hot and wild, but it never lasted long. Charlotte, however, could hold a mean grudge. She wasn't happy about it, but if she was honest, she could.

He leans into it, skimming down the corridors like a fearless biker on a hairpin bend. He gallops and vaults through the valleys and hills, canters and bobs through the outcrops and gorges of his improbable hoardings. Now and then he stops to climb over an obstacle, folding his long legs like picnic chairs. And all the while his chin juts up and out, and his body hangs beneath it, as if his grizzled jaw is wired to an invisible puppeteer. And all the while the backs of his big gnarly hands brush over the surfaces. For a tall man and an old man he can shift himself when he wants to.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t move like that. I wade, tripping over boxes and piles of mildewing curtains, getting caught in cables, hooked on hat stands, and assaulted by rutting ironing boards. I flounder over records, books, stained blankets, greasy collections of plastic bags, garden forks, antique mangles, a woman&#x2019;s patent leather shoe, and an unopened blender that also grates and peels. And cats, cats, cats.<br> <br>Cats of all kinds: ginger, black, brindled, tabby, and piebald. Cats sleeping, eyeing, scratching, and licking their arses on sour cushions, humping under upturned boxes, and crapping on great drifts of newspaper.<br> <br>I try not to look at the details but some little thing always catches my eye. A dead mouse curled in a teacup, a headless ceramic dray horse, a mannequin&#x2019;s pink severed limb: that sort of thing. I have a morbid bent.<br> <br>THIS MORNING I am excavating the northwest corner of the kitchen. Taking as modern topsoil a pile of local papers dated September 2015, I have traced back through layers and layers of history. On reaching a sprinkling of betting slips stuck to the linoleum (dated March 1990), I was able to estimate that this filth hole has not been cleaned for at least twenty-five years. Having opened several speculative trenches and located an oven, I am now enthusiastically cleaning its hob.<br> <br>I count (sing with me):<br> <ul> <li><br>Seven withered woodlice<br></li> <li><br>Six shriveled spiders<br></li> <li><br>Five black bags<br></li> <li><br>Four kitchen rolls<br></li> <li><br>Three dishcloths<br></li> <li><br>Two scouring pads<br></li> <li><br>And industrial-grade thick bleach.<br></li> </ul> <br>I AM wearing a disposable apron, extra-safe rubber gloves, and a face mask for the smell and for the spores.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s staring at me from the kitchen door, Mr. Cathal Flood, three feet taller than usual because he is standing on a mound of discarded carpet tiles. This makes him a giant because he is already a fair height: a long, thin, raw-boned, polluted old giant. The set of eyes he has trained on me are deep-socketed and unnervingly pale: the pale, pale, boreal blue of an Arctic hound.<br> <br>&#x201c;You had no business throwing out the cartons and so forth.&#x201d; He talks slowly and over-loudly, as if he&#x2019;s testing his voice. &#x201c;All my things gone and I had a need for them.&#x201d;<br> <br>I turn to him, breathing like Darth Vader through my mask, and shrug. I hope my shrug communicates a profound respect for his discarded possessions (twenty refuse sacks of empty sardine tins) combined with the regretful need for practical living.<br> <br>He narrows his gimlet eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a little shit, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>I pull off my mask. &#x201c;I wanted to find your cooker, Mr. Flood. I thought we might branch out, give the microwave a bit of a break.&#x201d;<br> <br>He watches me, his mouth tight with venom. &#x201c;I could curse you,&#x201d; he says, a hint of a sob in his frayed brogue. &#x201c;I could curse you to hell.&#x201d;<br> <br>Be my fecking guest, I say to my Brillo pad.<br> <br>I draw hearts on the rotten hob with bleach and then start scrubbing again. Mr. Flood mutters in broken Irish on the other side of the kitchen.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s lovely,&#x201d; I murmur. &#x201c;You have a poet&#x2019;s voice, Mr. Flood. Loaded with foreboding and misery.&#x201d;<br> <br>I flick the dishcloth blithely into the corners of the grill as Mr. Flood switches to English. He wishes me a barren womb (no changes there, then), eating without ever shitting, sodomy by all of hell&#x2019;s demons (simultaneously and one after another), fierce constrictions of the throat, a relentless smoldering of the groin, and an eternity in hell with my eyes on fire.<br> <br>Then he stops and I look up. He is pushing his hand through the spun floss of his hair (white halo, cobweb magnet, subject to static), patting it down, as if making himself presentable. Then he raises the still-dark caterpillars of his eyebrows a fraction of an inch and dips his head to one side. The effect is oddly charming; it has something of an ancient misanthropic squirrel about it. His mouth starts to work, in a series of stifled contortions, like a ventriloquist with hiccups.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you okay, Mr. Flood?&#x201d;<br> <br>He takes a deep breath and bares his tarnished dentures at me. I realize that he&#x2019;s smiling.<br> <br>I venture a tentative smile of my own.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you ever lose your temper?&#x201d; he asks.<br> <br>I study his face for signs of attack. &#x201c;No, Mr. Flood, I have a sunny disposition.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that a grand thing for the both of us, Drennan?&#x201d; he says, and with a quick pat of the wall he climbs down from the carpet tiles and swims back through the hallway.<br> <br>I stare at the damp patch on the seat of his trousers.<br> <br>I HAVE worked at Mr. Flood&#x2019;s house for just over a week and he&#x2019;s finally said my name.<br> <br>I consider this a relative success.<br> <br>Sam Hebden, a geriatric whisperer brought in at great expense from a better agency than ours, lasted three days before Mr. Flood ran him off the property with a hurling stick. I haven&#x2019;t had the pleasure, but I gather Sam was in tatters.<br> <br>Perhaps Biba Morel, Case Manager, was right after all in pairing us: Cathal Flood, meet Maud Drennan. Biba&#x2019;s cake-saturated voice was full of glee when she phoned me that day. I could picture her, squeezed behind the desk, sucking on a cream �clair. Her jowls wobbling with delight as she riffled through her agency files, performing that alchemic magic she was renowned for: matching geriatric hell-raisers with minimum-waged staff. Biba the social-care cupid, dressed in a stretch-waisted suit and floral scarf. Her voice honeyed with the joy of facilitating yet another spectacular client&#x2013;care worker relationship.<br> <br>I hardly listened, but if I had, I would have heard the words: <i>attracts a higher pay rate, challenging, assault, hoarding</i>, and <i>common ground</i>. I would certainly have agreed that Mr. Flood and myself, both being Irish, share a love of fiddle music, warm firesides, and a staunch belief in the malevolence of fairies. Not to mention the innate racial capacity to drink any man alive under the table whilst we dwell, in soft melancholy, on the lost wild beauty of our homeland.<br> <br>But now, as I survey the scene before me, my optimism falters.<br> <br>Even the cloakroom in Mr. Flood&#x2019;s straight-up, falling-down, Gothic crap heap is on a grand scale. Part-ballroom, part-cave, with a great black marble horse trough of a sink and wall sconces three feet high topped with whipped glass flames. An antiquated tin cistern roosts high above a monumental throne&#x2014;a masterpiece in scalloped ceramic. The color palette of this room is unremittingly unwholesome: the paintwork is lurid sphagnum and the tiles are veined the blue-black-green of an overripe cheese. The linoleum, where I&#x2019;ve swept the floor, is patterned with brown lozenges like ancient orderly blood stains.<br> <br>In one corner a limbless Barbie doll floats on an ocean of takeaway menus. Her smile is a picture of buoyant fortitude. I wonder if she is part of some sort of art installation, like the abstract expressionist shit that splatters the wall and the mug tree lodged in the toilet bowl.<br> <br>Perhaps this is a job for another day. Perhaps this is a job for never.<br> <br>A low-grade grumbling tells me that Mr. Flood is haunting the corridor outside. He has been watching me all afternoon, lurking behind stacked boxes and disemboweled televisions as I crinkle through his house in my disposable plastic apron.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m certain he&#x2019;s working up to something.<br> <br>Out of the corner of my eye I see him dragging a filing cabinet to the mouth of the door. He arranges himself on top of it, ruffling his many layers of clothing and folding his rangy limbs like an ancient disdainful crane.<br> <br>Then: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been thinking, Drennan.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good for you, Mr. Flood.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then: nothing.<br> <br>I glance across at him, waiting. He is staring down at the hands resting on his knees, so I consider them too. Palms big enough to span a melon, fingers slim and dextrous-looking: a pianist&#x2019;s or a surgeon&#x2019;s fingers. A smear of paint on the knuckle of his wrist, and long, curved nails, as strong as horn. He wears several checked shirts, each with overstuffed patch pockets, which give him the appearance of having multiple lopsided breasts. A woolen scarf is wound haphazardly about his head. On his feet he wears a pair of winkle-pickers laced with string. The toes alone are a meter long. They curl at the end with all the coiled threat of a scorpion&#x2019;s tail.<br> <br>I put on my safety goggles and turn back to the toilet, hastily extracting the mug tree from the bowl. I triple-bag it without breathing, tie the handles, and get ready to start my bleach offensive.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maud Drennan.&#x201d; He says my name slowly, as if tasting it, savoring it. &#x201c;There you are with your head down the toilet. Will you come out and let me talk to you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Now here&#x2019;s a departure: it wants to talk.<br> <br>I pull the chain on the old-fashioned cistern. The thing flushes with a rush of rust-colored water.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you want to talk about, Mr. Flood?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The house: how are you finding it?&#x201d;<br> <br>I glance up at him. He has an expression of twisted playfulness, as if he&#x2019;s pulled half the legs off a spider and is now going to watch it reel round in circles.<br> <br>&#x201c;The house is grand.&#x201d;<br> <br>He narrows his eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re rattled by it and by me. I can tell by your pinched little face.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My face is in no way rattled or pinched, Mr. Flood.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I make you nervous.&#x201d; His voice softens. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t lie to me now, Drennan. I can see it in your eyes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t flatter yourself,&#x201d; I growl into the toilet bowl.<br> <br>He sits in silence for a while, then, softer still: &#x201c;You have a beautiful set of eyes. The brown of a newly split conker.&#x201d;<br> <br>I squeeze bleach under the rim.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or a polished walnut table.&#x201d;<br> <br>I start to scrub.<br> <br>&#x201c;An amber glow to them in the light, like fine Cognac.&#x201d;<br> <br>I scrub harder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Had a little sister with eyes just like yours,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Could bore through the chest of a fella at ten paces and grab him by the heart at five. Eyes a man could drown in. Like hot treacle.&#x201d;<br> <br>I straighten up and throw him a withering look. He looks back at me gravely, sucking solemnly on his dentures, without even a hint of a smirk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course, it was miraculous that she had a pair of eyes at all,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Considering...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Considering what?&#x201d;<br> <br>He takes cigarette papers and a pouch of tobacco out of his breast pocket and puts them on his knees. He regards me slyly. &#x201c;Do you want to know why my sister&#x2019;s eyes were miraculous?&#x201d;<br> <br>I give a half shrug, which means not especially, and turn back to the cistern, giving the chain a pull for something to do. But it&#x2019;s too early: the mechanism clanks and there&#x2019;s nothing. I&#x2019;ll have to wait.<br> <br>Mr. Flood waits too. With calm, practiced movements he starts to roll a cigarette against his long thigh. His big hands are gentle, adept. I try not to watch him. He deftly licks the gummed strip on the paper, pinches the loose tobacco from the ends, and puts the cigarette between his lips.<br> <br>&#x201c;It all started with the wasps.&#x201d; He lights his cigarette and takes a drag.<br> <br>&#x201c;The wasps?&#x201d;<br> <br>He exhales. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s quite a story; do you want to hear it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is it a long story?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d; He gives me a crafty smile, his blue eyes lit. &#x201c;In my boyhood I was a great one for a dare.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Were you, now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There was nothing I wouldn&#x2019;t do if you bet me to do it. I&#x2019;d bite into the belly of a dead frog, shit on the priest&#x2019;s doorstep, or sleep the night on the grave of the terrifying Mrs. Gillespie.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You did all those things?&#x201d; I give up on the cistern, shut the lid of the toilet, and sit down on it.<br> <br>&#x201c;I did. I was a holy terror.&#x201d;<br> <br>I laugh, despite myself.<br> <br>He laughs too, delightedly. &#x201c;Now, one day the town&#x2019;s children bet me I wouldn&#x2019;t climb up the tree in Mrs. Clancy&#x2019;s yard and belt the hell out of her wasp&#x2019;s nest. It was the biggest nest anyone had ever seen. For years it had grown unchecked, a great whorled bunion of a thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Flood pauses for effect, taking another drag on his cigarette. &#x201c;Mr. Clancy had been forever promising Mrs. Clancy that he&#x2019;d deal with it. But it was well-known that he was terrified of wasps, having been stung on the end of his gooter whilst pissing in a hedgerow.&#x201d; Mr. Flood opens his legs and points emphatically at the drooping crotch of his trousers.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know what a gooter is, Mr. Flood.&#x201d;<br> <br>As if laughing, the cistern gives a sick gurgle.<br> <br>He grins. &#x201c;So you do. One day, word began to go around that Cathal Flood was going head-to-head with Clancy&#x2019;s wasps. There was nothing for it but to take a length of rope and a sturdy belting stick and set out for Clancy&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>For a long moment he sits smiling at his knees. &#x201c;Every child in the neighborhood came to watch me climb that tree. Up I went, and soon enough I got a proper look at the nest.&#x201d; He frowns. &#x201c;There they were, these great long feckers. Flying in and out, crawling over each other with their arses fat with venom.&#x201d;<br> <br>Above me, a nervous dribble of water runs down through the pipes.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I held firm and gave the nest a bit of a poke with my stick. All the children below roared and hopped as the wasps woke up and began to spill out of the nest.&#x201d;<br> <br>He eyes me belligerently. &#x201c;My next move was fearless. I stood up on the bough of the tree and gave the nest a good clout. It peeled from the trunk like a rotten blister and fell down to the ground amongst the children, who scattered to the four corners of the yard. We all stared at the nest in surprise.&#x201d; Mr. Flood hesitates, looking at me expectantly, waiting for the question.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why? What did you see?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>Mr. Flood leans forwards, his eyes wide. <i>&#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;</i><br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s just it,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Nothing happened. The nest lay there motionless. Dented but intact. And quiet. Not a peep from it. So the children drew nearer. And nothing happened. So the children drew nearer. And still nothing happened.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The wasps were dead?&#x201d;<br> <br>A smile plays on his lips. &#x201c;I jumped down out of the tree and everyone gathered around me and we began to debate whether I ought to stamp on the nest or set it on fire. And that&#x2019;s when Ruth heard it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Heard what?&#x201d;<br> <br>He looks like he&#x2019;s enjoying this. He has the voice for it: blarney-coated. &#x201c;As we debated, my baby sister had toddled up to the nest and crouched on the ground. She dipped her head to it and listened. Do you know what she heard?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nod slowly.<br> <br>&#x201c;A low angry drone. The sound of a thousand wasps protesting,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Ruth, in her innocence, picked up the nest. She cradled it in her arms and began to sing it a lullaby.&#x201d;<br> <br>He relights his roll-up, tapping ash into a nearby broken soup tureen. &#x201c;...</p><h2>The Birds of Pandemonium</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;A&nbsp;remarkable&nbsp;book.

They can teach us volumes about the interrelationships of humans and animals.<br><br> Their amazing stories make up the heart of this book. There&#x2019;s Sweetie, a tiny quail with an outsize personality; the inspiring Oscar, a disabled Lady Gouldian finch who can&#x2019;t fly but finds a brilliant way to climb to the highest perches of his aviary to roost. The ecstatic reunion of a disabled Victoria crowned pigeon, Wing, and her brother, Coffee, is as wondrous as the silent kinship that develops between Amadeus, a one-legged turaco, and an autistic young visitor.<br><br> As we come to know the individual birds, we also come to understand how much is at stake for many of these species. One of the aviary&#x2019;s greatest success stories is breeding the gorgeous green-naped pheasant pigeon, whose home in the New Guinea rainforest is being decimated. Thanks to efforts at Pandemonium, these birds may not share the same fate as the now-extinct dodo.<br><br><i>The Birds of Pandemonium</i> is about one woman&#x2019;s crusade to save precious lives, and it offers rare insights into how following a passion can transform not only oneself but also the world.<br><br> &#x201c;A delightful account.

Fleeing his homeland after a death sentence was placed on his head (when he dared court a woman above his station), he came to America one month after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, literally showing up on Benjamin Franklin's doorstep in Philadelphia with little more than a revolutionary spirit and a genius for engineering. Entering the fray as a volunteer in the war effort, he quickly proved his capabilities and became the most talented engineer of the Continental Army. Kosciuszko went on to construct the fortifications for Philadelphia, devise battle plans that were integral to the American victory at the pivotal Battle of Saratoga, and designed the plans for Fortress West Point&#x2015;the same plans that were stolen by Benedict Arnold. Then, seeking new challenges, Kosciuszko asked for a transfer to the Southern Army, where he oversaw a ring of African-American spies.</p><p> A lifelong champion of the common man and woman, he was ahead of his time in advocating tolerance and standing up for the rights of slaves, Native Americans, women, serfs, and Jews. Following the end of the war, Kosciuszko returned to Poland and was a leading figure in that nation's Constitutional movement. He became Commander in Chief of the Polish Army and valiantly led a defense against a Russian invasion, and in 1794 he led what was dubbed the Kosciuszko Uprising&#x2015;a revolt of Polish-Lithuanian forces against the Russian occupiers. Captured during the revolt, he was ultimately pardoned by Russia's Paul I and lived the remainder of his life as an international celebrity and a vocal proponent for human rights. Thomas Jefferson, with whom Kosciuszko had an ongoing correspondence on the immorality of slaveholding, called him "as pure a son of liberty as I have ever known." A lifelong bachelor with a knack for getting involved in doomed relationships, Kosciuszko navigated the tricky worlds of royal intrigue and romance while staying true to his ultimate passion&#x2015;the pursuit of freedom for all. This definitive and exhaustively researched biography fills a long-standing gap in historical literature with its account of a dashing and inspiring revolutionary figure.</p></p><p><p><b>Alex Storozynski</b> is president and executive director of the Kosciuszko Foundation.

It was a chilly autumn night, clouds hiding most of the stars, while the moonlight peeked through the dimness to expose a village in the distance. The couple wanted to find a priest who would marry them.1 </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Before the wagon reached town several horse men galloped up and latched on to the steeds, dragging them to a stop at the side of the road. Twenty-nine-year-old Capt. Thaddeus Kosciuszko leaped to the ground from his seat at the reins and drew his sword, ready to fight. The talented alumnus of the king`s royal military academy could have fought off the first two or three of Lord Sosnowski`s rural guards.2 </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>On the passenger side was Sosnowski`s daughter Louise, who wanted to elope with the captain after her father arranged for her to marry Prince Lubomirski to forge a dynasty between two clans of rich land magnates. While her lover was also part of the landed gentry, his family estate was small and struggling, in part because the Kosciuszkos were much easier on the serfs who farmed their land. Feudalism served these children of the nobility well, but the idealistic pair opposed the bondage of peasants. Lord Sosnowski denied Kosciuszko`s request for Louise`s hand, saying, "Pigeons are not meant for sparrows and the daughters of magnates are not meant for the sons of the common gentry."3 </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>As Kosciuszko held his sword between himself and Sosnowski`s guards, he looked past its long blade and saw that the lord was among them. Rather than engage in a clash that could harm Louise`s father before her eyes, he stood down. When he slid the saber back into its sheath, the sentries attacked and knocked him unconscious.4 They dragged Louise, kicking and screaming, back to the estate. When he came to several hours later, he found a white handkerchief that Louise had dropped in the scuffle. He stood up, stuffed the piece of linen into his pocket, and began the long walk home.5 </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Such was the legend of Kosciuszko`s failed elopement with the love of his life. While historians question the circumstances of just how far the escape plan actually went, three men who knew Kosciuszko, from three different countries, wrote similar accounts of his attempt to run off with Louise.6 </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>It was one of the first days of fall 1775, and the hats of peasants would have been visible through tall stalks of golden grains as their scythes swished back and forth through tall spires of grain swaying and bending over from the weight of the blond hulls that were ready to harvest. The blades made a rustling sound as they sliced through the slender shoots that tumbled to the ground. All around, vast flelds of wheat, rye, and hops stretched as far as the eye could see across the flat pole, or prairie lands, from which Poland gets its name. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The greedy land barons of the eighteenth century got rich off the brawn and sweat of the peasants who toiled in these fertile plains. These lords established a plutocracy to elect a king, and dictated the terms of government to him and to the rest of society. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>European serfdom was not as vicious as American slavery, but peasants were bought and sold with the land they tilled. Troublesome serfs were whipped and hanged if they tried to revolt. British colonies exploited slaves for tobacco, rice, indigo, sugar, and cotton, while Poland capitalized on serf labor to drive the grain trade. These vassals slogged away in the fields and lived in abject poverty, while the land magnates who abused them grew fat off the land. The peasants were subject to the whims of landowners such as Lord Sosnowski, who could beat them for infractions.7 </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>This was the world into which Thaddeus Kosciuszko was born on February 12, 1746.8 He grew up on a midsize estate where 31 peasant families worked the land that belonged to his family. His father, Ludwig Kosciuszko, was well off but not wealthy.9 </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Their comfortable wooden manor house had fireplaces and a tile stove where Kosciuszko`s mother, Tekla, would serve a typical Sunday dinner (prepared by the servants) of pork chops and peas, chicken soup, or borscht and kielbasa, accompanied by a mead-honey wine and, on special occasions, coffee. The elder Kosciuszko was easier on his farmhands than most landlords and taught his sons, Joseph and Thaddeus, and his daughters, Anna and Catherine, that treating the peasants fairly and providing them with a greater share of the fruits of their labor would make them more productive.10 Ludwig was a loving husband, father, and landlord who believed that all people were entitled to hope and happiness. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Thaddeus, the youngest child, was idealistic and took his father`s philosophy to heart. He played with peasant children, sometimes leading them to his favorite perch, a huge boulder where he would squat and observe the world around him.11 When he turned nine he was sent to the Catholic Piarist Fathers College at Lubieszow, near Pinsk. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>There he followed a new syllabus set up by Father Stanislaw Konarski, the Piarist leader of a cadre of reformist priests who were revolutionizing Poland`s school system. They instituted a curriculum that included lessons about British philosopher John Locke`s theory of a social contract, in which the people of a nation consent to be governed in exchange for social order.12 The Poles had already experimented with their own form of democracy, but Father Konarski`s educational reforms were laying the groundwork for a political enlightenment in Poland. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Consumed by the Piarist teachings, Kosciuszko was fascinated by the ancient Greeks and the Roman Empire. The works of Tacitus, Plutarch, and Aristides engrossed him and he was riveted by a biography of Timoleon, the Greek statesman and general who freed his fellow Corinthians and the Sicilians from the tyranny of Carthage. Kosciuszko explained his hero worship saying, "He overthrew tyrants, set up republics and never demanded any power for himself."13 </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The quixotic student drew parallels between Timoleon`s Greece and Poland`s subjugation by czarist Russia, whose army was growing more assertive in controlling Polish affairs. He saw in Timoleon a lesson in freeing his own people from Russian domination. Kosciuszko realized early on that Europe`s unjust class structure and agrarian economy allowed the rich to get richer by exploiting the peasants. To him the notion of happiness meant self-determination. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The modest Kosciuszko estate was in the Brest region of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a confederation of two nations that united in the fifteenth century to defend themselves from foreign invaders, such as the German Roman Catholic order of the Teutonic Knights. In recent years it had been a kingdom in decline because of foreign meddling in legislative affairs. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>While the Kosciuszkos were part of the well-heeled top ten percent of society known as the szlachta, there was also the top one percent, the upper echelon of land magnates made up of wealthy families that employed small armies to protect their dynasties.

Paul Wilson</b>, the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Repairman Jack novels, lives in Wall, New Jersey.<p>1Dr. Alan Bulmer</p><p>&#x201c;Can you feel this?&#x201d;</p><p>Alan gently pricked the skin of her right leg with a needle. Fear glittered in the woman&#x2019;s moist eyes as she shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;Ohmygod, she can&#x2019;t feel it!&#x201d;</p><p>Alan turned to the daughter. Her face was the same shade of off-white as the curtains surrounding and isolating them from the rest of the emergency room.</p><p>&#x201c;Would you wait outside for just a minute, please.&#x201d; He made sure his tone would indicate that he was not making a request.</p><p>The daughter found the slit in the curtains and disappeared.</p><p>Alan turned back to the mother and studied her as she lay on the gurney in the fluorescent-lit limbo, letting his mind page through what he remembered of Helen Jonas. Not much. Borderline diabetes and mild essential hypertension. She hadn&#x2019;t been to the office for two years, and on that occasion had been dragged in by her daughter. Then, half an hour ago, Alan had been sitting at home reading a journal when a call came from the emergency room that one of his patients had arrived, unable to walk or talk.</p><p>He&#x2019;d made his diagnosis within minutes of seeing her, but followed through with the rest of the examination. He moved the needle to the back of Helen&#x2019;s right hand.</p><p>&#x201c;How about this?&#x201d;</p><p>Again she shook her head.</p><p>He leaned over and touched the point to her left hand and she jerked it away. He then ran his thumbnail up from her bare right heel along the sole of her foot. The toes flared upward. He raised her right hand and told her to squeeze. The fingers didn&#x2019;t move. He let go and the arm dropped back to the mattress like dead meat.</p><p>&#x201c;Smile,&#x201c; he said, showing her a toothy grin.</p><p>The lady tried to imitate him, but only the left half of her face responded. Her right cheek and the right side of her mouth remained immobile.</p><p>&#x201c;How about the eyebrows?&#x201d; He oscillated his own, Groucho Marx style.</p><p>Both of the woman&#x2019;s eyebrows moved accordingly.</p><p>He listened to her heart and to her carotid arteries&#x2014;normal rhythm, no murmur, no bruits.</p><p>Alan straightened up.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a stroke, Helen. An artery&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>He heard the daughter say, &#x201c;Oh, no!&#x201d; behind the curtain, but he continued speaking. He would deal with her later. The main thing now was to reassure Helen.</p><p>&#x201c;An artery on the left side of your brain has blocked off and you&#x2019;ve lost the power on the right side of your body.&#x201d;</p><p>The voice came through the curtain again: &#x201c;Ohmygod, I knew it! She&#x2019;s paralyzed!&#x201d;</p><p>Why didn&#x2019;t she shut up? He knew the daughter was frightened, and he could appreciate that, but the daughter was not his primary concern at the moment, and she was only making a bad situation worse for her mother.</p><p>&#x201c;How long it will last, Helen, I don&#x2019;t know. You&#x2019;ll probably get some strength back; maybe all of it, and maybe none. Exactly how much and exactly how soon are impossible to say right now.&#x201d;</p><p>He put her good hand in his. She squeezed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to get you upstairs right now and start running some tests in the morning. We&#x2019;ll start some physical therapy, too. We&#x2019;ll take good care of you and check out the rest of you while you&#x2019;re here. The stroke is over and done with. So don&#x2019;t waste time worrying about it. It&#x2019;s history. From now on you work on getting back use of that arm and leg.&#x201d;</p><p>She smiled lopsidedly and nodded. Finally he pulled his hand away and said, &#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d;</p><p>He turned and stepped through the curtains to where the daughter was talking to the air.</p><p>&#x201c;Whatamygonnadoo? I gotta call Charlie! I gotta call Rae! Whatamygonnadoo?&#x201d;</p><p>Alan put his hand on her shoulder and gave her trapezius a gentle squeeze. She flinched and stopped her yammering.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna clam up, okay?&#x201d; he said in a low voice. &#x201c;All you&#x2019;re doing is upsetting her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But whatamygonnadoo? I&#x2019;ve got so much to do! I gotta&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>He squeezed again, a little harder. &#x201c;The most important thing for you to do right now is go stand by her and tell her how she&#x2019;s going to come stay with you for a while after she gets out of the hospital and how you&#x2019;re going to have everybody over for Easter.&#x201d;</p><p>She stared at him. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean she&#x2019;s going to be coming home?&#x201d;</p><p>Alan smiled and nodded. &#x201c;Yeah. After a little stay in rehab. She thinks she&#x2019;s going to die here. She&#x2019;s not. But she needs someone holding her hand now and talking about the near future, how life&#x2019;s going to go on and how she&#x2019;s going to be part of it.&#x201d; He steered her toward the curtains. &#x201c;Get in there.&#x201d;</p><p>McClain, head nurse for the ER, pushing sixty and built like the Berlin Wall, saw him from the desk and held a tPA package with a questioning look. The CT scan had shown no bleed, but from what he&#x2019;d gathered from the daughter, the stroke had occurred more than three hours ago. That eliminated tPA as an option.</p><p>Alan signed the orders, wrote the admitting note, then dictated the history and physical.</p><p>After giving final reassurances and saying good night to Helen Jonas and her daughter, Alan finally got out of the hospital, into his Subaru Outback, and on his way back home. He drove slowly, taking the short route through downtown Monroe where all the buildings clustered around the tiny harbor like anxious bathers waiting for a signal from the lifeguard. He liked the solitude of a late night drive through the shopping district. During the day the streets would be stop and go all the way. But at this hour, especially now that all the construction was done and he didn&#x2019;t have to dodge excavations or follow detour signs, he could cruise, adjusting his speed so he could hit the lights just right. A smooth ride, now that the trolley tracks had been covered with asphalt. He pushed a CD into the player and The Crows came on, singing &#x201c;Oh, Gee.&#x201d;</p><p>He watched the clapboarded shop fronts slip by. He hadn&#x2019;t been in favor of the downtown restoration at first when the Village Council&#x2014;why did Long Island towns insist on calling themselves villages?&#x2014;decided to redo the harbor front in a nineteenth-century whaling motif. Never mind that any whaling in this vicinity of the North Shore had been centered to the east in places like Oyster Bay and Cold Spring Harbor, the village wanted a make over. Passing the newly faced seafood restaurants, clothing stores, and antique shops, Alan had to admit they looked good. The former lackluster hodgepodge of storefronts had taken on a new, invigorated personality, fitting perfectly with the white-steepled First Presbyterian Church and the brick-fronted town hall. Monroe was now something more than just another of the larger towns along Long Island&#x2019;s &#x201c;Preferred North Shore.&#x201d;</p><p>The illusion almost worked. He tried to picture Ishmael, harpoon on shoulder, walking down to the harbor toward the Pequod... passing the new Blockbuster.</p><p>Well, nothing was perfect.</p><p>A red light finally caught him and he pulled to a stop. As he waited he watched Clubfoot Annie&#x2014;the closest thing Monroe had to a shopping bag lady&#x2014;hobble across the street in front of him. Alan had no idea of her real name and, so far as he knew, neither did anybody else. She was known to everyone simply as Clubfoot Annie.</p><p>He was struck now, as he was whenever he saw her, by how a misshapen foot that no one had bothered to correct on a child could shape the life of the adult. People like Annie always managed to get to Alan, making him want to go back in time and see to it that someone did the right thing. So simple... some serial casting on her infant equinovarus deformity would have straightened it out to normal. Who would Annie be today if she&#x2019;d grown up with a normal foot? Maybe she&#x2014;</p><p>Something slammed against the right front door, jolting Alan, making him jump in his seat. A ravaged caricature of a human face pressed against the passenger door window.</p><p>&#x201c;You!&#x201d; the face said as it rolled back and forth against the glass. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one! Lemme in! Gotta talk t&#x2019;ya!&#x201d;</p><p>His hair and beard were long and knotted and as filthy as his clothes. The eyes shone but gave no evidence of intelligence. What ever mind he had must have been pickled a long time ago. The man straightened up and pulled on the door handle, but it was locked. He moved along the side of the car toward the hood. He looked like a Bowery derelict. Alan could not remember ever seeing the likes of him in Monroe.</p><p>He crossed in front of the car, pointing at Alan over the hood, all the while babbling unintelligibly. Tense but secure, Alan waited until the man was clear of the front of the car, then he gently accelerated. The man pounded his fist once on the trunk as the car left him behind.</p><p>In the rearview mirror, Alan saw him start running behind the car, then stop and stand in the middle of the street, staring after him, a picture of dejection and frustration as he waved his arms in the air and then let them flop down to his sides.</p><p>The episode left Alan shaken. He glanced at the passenger window and was startled to see a large oily smudge in the shape of the derelict&#x2019;s face. As it picked up the light of a passing street lamp, it seemed to look at him, reminding him uncomfortably of the face from the Shroud of Turin.</p><p>He was pulling up to another red light when his beeper chittered, startling him into jamming on his brakes. He checked the illuminated readout:</p><p>Call Mrs. Nash re: son. Abd pain and vomiting. The phone number followed.</p><p>Alan straightened in his seat. Sylvia Nash&#x2014;he knew her well; a concerned parent but not an alarmist. If she was calling, it meant something was definitely wrong with J...</p></p><h2>Come to Grief</h2><p>After a tragic suicide disrupts the trial of a much-loved racing figure accused of corruption--a case in which he was to testify--conscience-stricken jockey-turned-sleuth Sid Halley returns to investigate this much too convenient death</p><p>Dick Francis brings back Sid Halley, champion jockey-turned-PI of his earlier novels Whip Hand and Odds Against, in this troubling story.

In comparison with beef, the venison and elk were lean, even at this season. Each soldier consumed up to nine pounds of meat per day, along with whatever fruit the area afforded and some cornmeal, and still felt hungry.</p><p>Stephen E. Ambrose,<br><i>Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis,</i><br><i>Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening</i><br><i>of the American West</i></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>ONE</b></p><p>Before going outside to his pickup for his gun, the Wyoming game warden cooked and ate four and a half pounds of meat.</p><p>He&#x2019;d begun his meal with pronghorn antelope steaks, butterflied, floured, and browned in olive oil. Then an elk chop, pan-fried with salt and pepper, adding minced garlic to the cast-iron skillet. His first drink, sipped while he was cooking the antelope, was a glass of Yukon Jack and water on the rocks. By the time he broiled a half dozen mourning dove breasts, he no longer bothered with the ice or the water. As he sat down late in the evening with an elk tenderloin so rare that blood pooled around it on his plate, he no longer used the glass, but drank straight from the bottle.</p><p>He ate no vegetables; unless one counted the saut�ed onions he had slathered on a grass-fed Hereford beef T-bone, or the minced garlic. Just meat.</p><p>He needed air, and stood up.</p><p>His mind swam, the room rotated, his heavy boots clunked across the floor. He paused at the jamb, using it to brace himself upright. He stared at a flyspeck on the wall, tried to will the quadruple images he was seeing down to a more manageable two.</p><p>Finally, he opened the door. It was dark except for a blue streetlight on the northern corner of the block. A full moon lit up the crags of the mountains, casting them in dim blue-gray. The chill of the fall was already a guest. He stumbled down the broken sidewalk toward his truck. As he approached, his pickup seemed to swell and deflate, as if it were breathing.</p><p>&#x201c;Something smells good inside,&#x201d; a voice said. It startled the game warden, and he squinted toward it, trying to concentrate, to hear it over the mild roar in his ears. A neighbor wearing a tam on his head was walking a poodle down the middle of the street.</p><p>&#x201c;Meat,&#x201d; Will Jensen said abruptly, almost shouting. It was sometimes hard these days to hear his own voice above the roar.</p><p>&#x201c;See you,&#x201d; the neighbor called as he walked down the street. &#x201c;<i>Bon app�tit!&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>These people here,</i> Will thought. <i>A goddamned poodle and a tam.</i></p><p><b>HIS&nbsp;.44 MAGNUM,</b> his bear gun, was on the truck&#x2019;s bench seat where he had left it. Will drew it out of the holster. Holding it loosely in his right hand, he turned back for the house, tripped over his own boots, and fell in the gravel. A red finger of alarm probed into his brain, concern about accidentally discharging the weapon in his fall. Then he snorted a laugh, thinking, <i>Who cares?</i></p><p><b>HE DIDN&#x2019;T KNOW</b> how much later it was when he stirred awake. He was still sitting at the table, but had passed out face forward into his plate. Crisp grouse skin stuck to his cheek, and he pawed at it clumsily until it fluttered to the floor.</p><p>Angry, he swept the table clear with his arm. Grease smeared across the Formica. The dirty plate cracked in half when it hit the wall.</p><p>Where was his&nbsp;.44?</p><p>He found it on his bed, where he had tossed it earlier. Along with the weapon, he grabbed a framed photo of his family from the bedside table. He took them both back into the kitchen.</p><p><i>Forlorn</i> was a word he had come to like in recent months. It was a word that sounded like what it described. &#x201c;<i>Forlorn,</i>&#x201d; he said aloud to himself, &#x201c;<i>I feel forlorn. I am a forlorn man.</i>&#x201d; Something about the word soothed him, because it defined him, made him admit what he was.</p><p>What in the hell was wrong with him? Why did he feel this way, after so many years of balancing on the beam?</p><p>The roar in his ears was now so faint that it reminded him of a soft breeze in the treetops. His eyes filled with unexpected, stinging tears, and he drank a long pull from the bottle. He cocked the&nbsp;.44, watched the cylinder rotate. He opened his mouth and pressed the muzzle against the top of his palate. There was a burning, acrid taste. When was the last time he cleaned it?</p><p>Why did that matter now?</p><p>He stared at the photo he&#x2019;d propped up on the table. It swam. He closed his eyes so tightly that he saw orange fireworks on the inside of his eyelids. He tried to concentrate on the&nbsp;.44 in his fist and the muzzle in his mouth. His stomach was on fire; he tried to fight the urge to get violently sick. He tasted the bitter whiskey a second time.</p><p>Concentrate&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>TWO</b></p><p>The wedding of Bud Longbrake and Missy Vankueren took place at noon, on a sun-filled Saturday in September, on the front lawn of the Longbrake Ranch, twenty miles from town. Everyone was there.</p><p>The governor and his wife, most of the state senate, where Bud served as majority leader, the state&#x2019;s lone congressman, and what seemed like half of Saddlestring filled 250 metal folding chairs and spilled over into the lawn. Both U.S. senators had sent their regrets. The crisp blue shoulders of the Bighorn Mountains framed the wedding party. The day smelled of just-cut grass and wood smoke from the barbecue pit behind the house, where a prime Longbrake steer and a 4-H pig were roasting. It was a still, windless morning. A single cloud grazed lazily along the peaks. The only sounds were from car doors slamming as more guests arrived, pulling into the shorn hay meadow that served as a parking lot in the back, and occasional mewls from cattle in a distant holding corral.</p><p>Joe Pickett sat in the second row. He wore a jacket and tie, dark slacks, and polished black cowboy boots. He was in his mid-thirties, lean, medium height. His thirteen-year-old daughter, Sheridan, sat next to him in a new blue dress. She shone brightly, he thought; long blond hair still streaked with summer highlights, a touch of pink lipstick, open, attractive face, eyes that took in everything. She watched intently as her mother, Marybeth, and eight-year-old sister, Lucy, took part in the ceremony. Lucy was the flower girl, wearing white taffeta. Marybeth, the matron of honor, stood on a riser next to Dale Longbrake and the rest of the wedding party. The men wore black western-cut tuxedos and black Stetsons.</p><p>Joe and his wife exchanged glances, and he could tell from her eyes that she was exasperated. Her mother, Missy Vankueren, was an experienced wedding planner, having been the featured bride in three previous ceremonies. Missy had been designing the event for over a year with the intensity and precision of a general implementing a major ground offensive, Joe thought, and she had enlisted a reluctant Marybeth as her second lieutenant. Endless discussions and phone calls had finally resulted in this day, which Marybeth had come to refer to as &#x201c;Operation Massive Ranch Wedding.&#x201d;</p><p>Joe nodded toward the mountains and whispered to Sheridan, &#x201c;See that cloud?&#x201d;</p><p>Sheridan looked. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I would wager that by Wedding Five, Missy will have figured out how to get rid of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Dad!</i>&#x201d; she whispered fiercely. But the corners of her mouth tugged with a conspiratorial grin. He winked at her, and she rolled her eyes, turning back to the wedding that was about to begin.</p><p>There was a growing murmur as the bride appeared, on cue, beneath an arch of pink and white flowers. Joe and Sheridan rose to their feet with the rest of the crowd. Applause rippled from the front to the back as Missy appeared, glowing, wide-eyed, looking demurely at the throng she had turned out.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe that&#x2019;s my grandmother,&#x201d; Sheridan said to Joe. &#x201c;She looks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stunning,&#x201d; Joe said, finishing the sentence for her. Missy looked thirty, not sixty, he thought. She was a slim brunette, her face and hair perfect, her eyes glistening in a too-large head that always looked great in photos. She held a bouquet of pink and white flowers against her shimmering plum dress.</p><p>Joe heard Bud Longbrake say, in a reverent tone of appreciation he usually reserved for great cutting horses or seed bulls: &#x201c;<i>There&#x2019;s</i> my girl.&#x201d;</p><p><b>THE RECEPTION WAS</b> held behind the huge log home, under hundred-year-old cottonwoods. A swing band from Billings played on a stage, and couples spun on a hardwood floor that had been moved to the ranch just for the occasion from a vacated mid-forties dance hall in Winchester. The floor was unique in that it was mounted on carriage springs and had been used for Saturday night dances when big bands used to stop over in Wyoming en route to real paying gigs on the east or west coasts.</p><p>Joe ushered Sheridan through the reception line, shaking hands. Bud Longbrake slapped him on the shoulder and said, &#x201c;Welcome to the family.&#x201d;</p><p><i>I&#x2019;ve got a family,</i> Joe thought.</p><p>Missy reached for Joe, and pulled his head down next to hers. He felt the bouquet she still clutched crush into his hair. &#x201c;Never thought I&#x2019;d pull this one off, did you?&#x201d; she whispered.</p><p>Surprised, he pulled away. She grinned slyly at him, and despite himself, he grinned back. She was a substantial adversary, he thought. He&#x2019;d hate to meet her in a dark alley.</p><p>&#x201c;Congratulations,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Bud is a fine man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I think I got the best of the deal,&#x201d; Bud said, wrapping his arm around Missy&#x2019;s slim waist.</p><p>&#x201c;You did,&#x201d; she said, flashing her wide smile.</p><p><i>And her name is already on the ranch deed,</i> Joe thought. <i>She owns half of everything we see as far as we can see it. She pulled it off, all right.</i></p><p>Marybeth was next, and had been carefully watching the exchange that took place a moment before.</p><p>&#x201c;You look wonderful,&#x201d; he said.</p><p><i>Thank God it&#x2019;s over,</i> she mouthed. He nodded back, agreeing with her.</p><p>&#x201c;Welcome to the family,&#x201d; Bud was telling Sheridan.</p><p>Joe shot him a look.</p><p><b>&#x201c;JOE, ARE YOU</b> sure she said <i>that</i>?&#x201d; Marybeth asked later, as they sat at a table under the trees with their plates of appetizers. Joe had waited for Sheridan and Lucy to find their friends before he told Marybeth about her mother.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m quoting.&#x201d;</p><p>Marybeth shook her head, looking hard at Joe to see if he was joking. She obviously determined he wasn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s something else, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Always has been,&#x201d; Joe said. &#x201c;What I can&#x2019;t figure out is how you survived.&#x201d;</p><p>Marybeth smiled and patted his hand. &#x201c;Neither can I, at times.&#x201d;</p><p>Joe sipped from a bottle of beer that had been offered to him from a stock tank full of ice.</p><p>&#x201c;You two have a very strange relationship,&#x201d; Marybeth said, looking across the lawn at her mother.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think we had one at all.&#x201d;</p><p>Missy had never made a secret of the fact that she felt Marybeth had married beneath herself. Instead of the doctor, real estate magnate, or U.S. senator Marybeth should have chosen, Missy thought, her most promising daughter wound up with Joe Pickett, a Wyoming game warden with a salary that capped out at $36,000 a year. Marybeth&#x2019;s career as a corporate lawyer or a politician&#x2019;s wife, in Missy&#x2019;s view, had been unfulfilled. Rather, Marybeth stayed with Joe as he moved from place to place in their early years together, before Joe was named game warden to the Saddlestring District. Then Sheridan came along, followed by Lucy, and in Missy&#x2019;s eyes it was all but over for her daughter. Because of incidents relating to Joe Pickett and his job, Marybeth had been injured and could have no more children. Then a foster daughter had been lost. It was frustrating for Missy, Joe thought. There she was, providing a living example of how to keep trading up&#x2014;casting off husbands in exchange for newer, wealthier, and shinier models&#x2014;and her daughter just didn&#x2019;t get it. Missy literally tried to show Marybeth how it could be done by marrying Bud Longbrake right in front of her, Joe thought.</p><p>Marybeth still had fire, intelligence, beauty, and ambition, Joe and Missy both knew. She also had a growing melancholy, which she tried hard to overcome.</p><p>&#x201c;Look at Bud&#x2019;s kids,&#x201d; Marybeth said, nodding toward a table set as far away from the others as possible while still being in the shade. &#x201c;They just don&#x2019;t look happy. Don&#x2019;t stare at them, though.&#x201d;</p><p>Joe shifted in his chair. Bud had a son and a daughter from his previous marriage. The son, Bud Jr., had flown in for the wedding from Missoula, where he was a street musician and a professional student at UM. Bud Jr. wore billowy cargo shorts, leather sandals, a T-shirt, and a sour expression. Missy had told Joe and Marybeth that although Bud Jr. had never wanted anything to do with the ranch while growing up, he was content to wait things out, wait for Bud to pass along or sell the ranch. Even after taxes, Bud Jr. stood to gain a huge inheritance. It was the same with Sally, Bud&#x2019;s daughter. Thrice married (like her new stepmother, who had just surpassed her in the race), Sally lived in Portland, Oregon, and was currently between husbands. Sally was attractive in a wounded, Bohemian way, Joe thought. He had heard she was an artist, specializing in wrought iron.</p><p>Joe turned back. &#x201c;No, they don&#x2019;t look happy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t like it that Bud made Missy cosignatory on all of this,&#x201d; Marybeth said, waving her hand to indicate literally all they could see. &#x201c;Bud Jr. got hammered at the dress rehearsal last night and shouted some things at his father before he passed out in the bushes. Sally was there last night for about a half an hour, before she disappeared with one of Bud&#x2019;s ranch hands.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Welcome to the family,&#x201d; Joe said to his wife.</p><p><b>THE NEW TWELVE</b> Sleep County sheriff, Kyle McLanahan, stood in front of Joe and Marybeth in the food line. The piquant smell of barbecued pork and beef hung heavy in the light mountain air.</p><p>&#x201c;Kyle,&#x201d; Joe said, nodding.</p><p>&#x201c;Joe. Marybeth. Congratulations are in order, I guess.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess,&#x201d; Joe said.</p><p>&#x201c;Same to you,&#x201d; Marybeth said coolly. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen you since the election.&#x201d;</p><p>McLanahan nodded, hitched up his pants. Looked toward the mountains. Squinted. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a lot of work to do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yup,&#x201d; Joe said.</p><p>Kyle McLanahan had been the longtime chief deputy for local legend O. R. &#x201c;Bud&#x201d; Barnum, who had been sheriff for twenty-eight years. Barnum had owned the county in a sense, having a hand in just about every aspect of it. His downfall came over the past five years, as his reputation eroded, then rotted and tumbled in on itself. That Barnum&#x2019;s decline coincided with Joe&#x2019;s arrival in Saddlestring was no coincidence. The Outfitter Murders, mishandled by Barnum, had begun the slide. Barnum&#x2019;s shadowy involvement with the Stockman&#x2019;s Trust continued it. The ex-sheriff&#x2019;s complicity with Melinda Strickland in her raid on the Sovereign compound started the local gossip that Barnum had lost his commitment to the community and was looking out only for...</p></p><h2>Suicide Squad Vol. 1: Trial by Fire</h2><p>Just in time for the highly anticipated 2016 blockbuster film release, this collection is the definitive and explosive introduction to John Ostrander&#x2019;s modern SUICIDE SQUAD.<br><br>It&#x2019;s up to the government to keep the bad guys in captivity-but Amanda Waller, a tough-as-nails federal agent, has other plans.

But upon reading an interpretation of the Good Samaritan in a sermon by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he realized that in order to be a true Christian, he must show compassion for all women regardless of their needs. In 2009, he stopped practicing obstetrics to focus entirely on providing safe abortions for the women who need help the most&#x2014;often women in poverty and women of color&#x2014;and in the hot bed of the pro-choice debate: the South. He soon thereafter traded in his private practice and his penthouse apartment in Hawaii for the life of an itinerant abortion provider, focusing most recently on women in the Deep South.<br> <br>In <i>Life&#x2019;s Work</i>, Dr. Willie Parker tells a deeply personal and thought-provoking narrative that illuminates the complex societal, political, religious, and personal realities of abortion in the United States from the unique perspective of someone who performs them and defends the right to do so every day. He also looks at how a new wave of anti-abortion activism, aimed at making incremental changes in laws and regulations state by state, are slowly chipping away at the rights of women to control their own lives. In revealing his daily battle against mandatory waiting periods and bogus rules governing the width of hallways, Dr. Parker uncovers the growing number of strings attached to the right to choose and makes a powerful Christian case for championing reproductive rights.</p><p>Dr. Willie Parker sits on the board of institutions at the forefront of the fight for reproductive justice, including as the chair-elect of the board of Physicians for Reproductive Health. He is the recipient of Planned Parenthood&#x2019;s Margaret Sanger Award, an honor also bestowed upon Hillary Clinton and Jane Fonda, and appeared on Ebony&#x2019;s Power 100 list. He has been featured widely for his work, including in <i>Slate</i>, <i>Jezebel</i>, <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, NPR&#x2019;s <i>Morning Edition</i>, <i>Salon</i>, and more. While a fascinating profile on Dr. Parker in <i>Esquire</i> sparked national interest in 2014, he is now the subject of <i>Trapped</i> (Trilogy Films), a documentary about the legal battle to keep abortion clinics in the South open.Life&#x2019;s Work PROLOGUE<p></p> The Women<p></p> <br>At 6:30 a.m. on procedure day, the abortion clinic waiting room at Reproductive Health Services in Montgomery, Alabama, is as hushed as a church. Inside, beyond the bulletproof doors, the women are waiting for me, occupying every vinyl-covered chair, occasionally perched on windowsills: twenty-five, thirty, as many as fifty women sometimes. When I pass through the room in my street clothes&#x2014;the uniform of sweats, baseball cap, and prescription shades that allows me to hide in plain sight&#x2014;most of them won&#x2019;t even look up. But occasionally a woman will have heard of me, the &#x201c;nice black doctor&#x201d; at this clinic, and she&#x2019;ll meet my eyes and smile. She may believe that I&#x2019;m going to get her through this, whatever &#x201c;this&#x201d; means to her, and hope that by making contact, with a glance, she will show me that she is an individual, with a story, and reasons, and dreams of her own.<br> <br>I am here, in this crowded abortion clinic in Alabama&#x2014;or Mississippi, or Georgia, where I also work&#x2014;to provide abortions for women because they say they need them. I am a Christian, raised in churches right here in the South&#x2014;in Birmingham, an hour-plus drive from Montgomery. In the black churches of my childhood, an unplanned pregnancy was reason enough for a public shaming, or even expulsion from church ministry. A girl who became accidentally pregnant might be forced to stand up before the congregation on a Sunday morning and beg forgiveness for her sins, while the equally sexually curious boy who helped get her pregnant sat, with his brothers and sisters in Christ, in judgment of her. Unbeknownst to me, the women in the churches of my youth must have sometimes had abortions&#x2014;of course they did, legally or illegally&#x2014;but no one ever spoke of them. This was the Christianity I grew up in, and it has taken me decades of emotional, spiritual, and intellectual wrestling, with my conscience and with my world, to get to the place where I am now. I remain a follower of Jesus. And I believe that as an abortion provider I am doing God&#x2019;s work. I am protecting women&#x2019;s rights, their human right to decide their futures for themselves, and to live their lives as they see fit. Today, as I write this, access to safe and compassionate abortion care is under unprecedented threat, most often from people who call themselves Christians. What I do is unfathomable to my faithful opponents, yet preserving that access is my calling. As a Christian and as a doctor, I am committed to protecting women&#x2019;s health.<br> <br>This moral understanding came to me slowly, but it started to coalesce more than a dozen years ago when I had what I call my &#x201c;come to Jesus moment&#x201d; around the subject of abortion. From childhood I had long inferred that abortions were wrong, and for the first half of my career as an ob-gyn, I refused to perform them. But as I matured in both my faith and my profession, I found I was increasingly at odds with myself, an inner conflict that sat uncomfortably with me. I never questioned women&#x2019;s individual choices, but until I found clarity and certainty around the abortion issue&#x2014;what I call the head-heart connection&#x2014;I recused myself, as a practitioner, from the fight.<br> <br>Since achieving that clarity of mind and fullness of heart that liberated my understanding around this work, my passion for it has doubled. I have been working as an abortion provider for more than a dozen years with increasing energy and focus. I moved back to my hometown of Birmingham to care for women living in communities like the one in which I was raised. Some of my patients, poor and black, might easily be one of my three sisters or a cousin or an aunt&#x2014;others might be anyone: you, your niece, your daughter, your mother, or your best friend; many are women with some means, in the middle and upwardly mobile classes. Some of my patients have formulated strong political opinions about abortion, but more have not and merely walk through my doors because they&#x2019;re doing what they deem necessary for themselves. I do this work in the context of a ramped-up national crusade against it&#x2014;one that promises, with a Republican president and Congress, to intensify. Calls from the antis to overturn Roe, to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and to defund Planned Parenthood are growing ever louder. Each one of these backward moves will not only restrict women&#x2019;s access to&nbsp;safe, affordable abortion care, but will diminish women&#x2019;s access to good&nbsp;health care in general, putting their lives and the lives of their children at risk. And poor women and women of color will bear the brunt of this political posturing by ideologues&#x2014;as they always do.<br> <br>Already, I have consciously put myself on the front lines. Since 2010, when right-wing extremists swept the nation&#x2019;s statehouses and legislatures, more than three hundred state laws have been passed aimed at restricting access to abortion&#x2014;despite the fact that it is legal. In twenty-seven states, women are now forced to wait one, two, or even three days between receiving mandatory &#x201c;counseling&#x201d; (which often contains bogus information) and obtaining an abortion, a barrier that puts an undue burden on working women, women with children, and women who live in rural areas, requiring them to take time off work and spend additional money to travel back and forth to a clinic that may be two hundred miles from home. Fourteen states since 2010 have banned procedures after twenty weeks&#x2014;a violation of Roe. Thirty-seven states have circumscribed &#x201c;medication abortion,&#x201d; placing limits on patients&#x2019; access to the FDA-approved pill that ends pregnancy in its early phases. And more than two dozen states have taken aim at the daily operations of the clinics themselves, placing irrational hurdles in their way with the motive of shutting them down. These laws have had the desired effect. Since 2011, more than 160 abortion clinics have closed. These laws have been passed so invisibly, so incrementally, that few have even noticed them. But they are affecting the real futures of real women by forcing them into lives they did not choose.<br> <br>I think of the twenty-one-year-old woman I saw in the only open clinic in Mississippi in 2013. Born and raised in the Delta, she was home for the summer, having graduated from a Division I university, where she studied on an athletic scholarship, and she was on her way to a law school. Finding herself seven weeks pregnant, she sought my care, and I did her abortion without complication. Talking with her, I saw how clearly she saw her life. She was on the precipice, about to write a new story for herself. She would not be another dirt-poor, single mother. She would live in a world of limitless possibility, which she would create with her law degree. I sensed in her no flinching, no hesitancy, no reservation about her abortion decision. All her life, this woman had been making decisions with her future in mind, and when I saw how consequential this one was to her, my resolve to do this work increased.<br> <br>When I became an abortion provider in 2002, there were twelve abortion clinics in my home state of Alabama. Now there are five. Next door, in Mississippi, there is only one. To do abortion where the need is greatest is to be itinerant, always on the road, because the distances between clinics are so great. In the car, I listen to all kinds of music: Miles and Coltrane, Kenny G and Prince, Public Enemy and the Notorious B.I.G. I am a devotee to books on tape. My time on the road has become &#x201c;me time.&#x201d; I am always encumbered with laundry and luggage&#x2014;the chores mandated by a nomad&#x2019;s existence. Like every busy person, I keep a fantasy future in my mind; I have purchased cooking pots and a double bass for the leisure I imagine but do not possess. Instead, I fill the gaps in my schedule with my other vocation: speaking engagements and board meetings, traveling the country like a twenty-first-century Saint Paul, preaching the truth about reproductive rights, because I have come to see that I&#x2019;m the one, as the old saying goes, that I&#x2019;ve been waiting for. As I drive long miles I become contemplative, and I reflect on my heroes: Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman&#x2014;exemplars who carried the lives and aspirations of a whole people on their backs.<br> <br>My five brothers and sisters tell me they worry for my life, and I hear their concern. I understand that my commitment to this work puts me at risk. Eleven people, including four doctors, have, since the passage of Roe v. Wade in 1973, been assassinated for this work&#x2014;killed in cold blood for the so-called sin of providing safe and legal health care for women. Rationally, I know this. But I reiterate to my siblings, and my concerned friends, my vow: I refuse to give in to fear. The truth is that I am more afraid of living a life of cowardice, of allowing any anxiety over prospective harm to keep me from my convictions. I can live with the awareness that someone might harm me. I am not so sure that I am brave enough to live with the awareness that I was too afraid to do what I knew to be right.<br> <br>Though my conscience is clear and I am sure of the righteousness of my path, when I pull into the parking lot in Montgomery, or Tuscaloosa, or whatever abortion clinic I&#x2019;m working in that day, I nevertheless experience an unbidden primal shiver of fear. For standing there every morning, no matter how early the hour, in the melting heat or in the driving rain, are the picketers&#x2014;usually middle-aged white men who scream at me. &#x201c;Murderer!&#x201d; they shout. &#x201c;Baby killer!&#x201d; &#x201c;Filthy Negro abortionist!&#x201d; I do not for a second imagine that they have right on their side. I am not by nature easily intimidated. Yet their intention is to provoke me, and I do get provoked. These men incite a rage in me that I am able to quell most hours of the day. But at that early hour, sitting in my car, sometime around dawn, I am infuriated that I, who am in my fifties, gray-bearded and entirely bald, a physician with a medical degree from the University of Iowa and a master&#x2019;s in public health from Harvard University, have to do a version of a perp walk in order to enter my own place of work. And I am aware that, even though the intention of these protesters is to throw sticks, not stones&#x2014;the truth is, you never know. One of them might come unhinged at any moment; any one of them might be carrying a gun. So while I have refused to hide, to hire a bodyguard or wear a bulletproof vest, it&#x2019;s impossible to escape these thoughts: People have been assassinated for what you do. This could be your last day. Every morning, after I turn off the ignition, I sit in my car and collect myself, to quiet myself down. I channel the courage of the civil rights legacy that I have studied, and I correlate these verbal assaults to those, much fiercer and more relentless, that Dr. King and others withstood every day. As I open the car door, I remind myself of what my mother told me when I was eight years old, the first time anyone ever called me &#x201c;nigger&#x201d;: I should never hit someone unless he hits me first. I take a deep breath and I gather my stuff: keys, laptop, phone, bag. I do not engage. I exit my car and use the remote lock. I stand up straight, my eyes focused on the ground, and I walk, neither fast nor slow, toward my place of work.<br> <br>It is never lost on me that the women in the waiting room have had to walk past these protesters, too. Even if they were escorted to the door by a cheerful young pro-choice activist with bright pink hair who carries a protective rainbow umbrella, they&#x2019;ve heard the vitriol&#x2014;different from the insults hurled at me, but no less offensive. &#x201c;Think twice!&#x201d; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t murder your baby!&#x201d; The antis shout these things, as if these women had not minds of their own. As if their decision fails to merit respect. As if they were not, as most of them are, adults exercising a legal right to make a private health-care decision for themselves. (Imagine, if you will, these verbal assaults being hurled at any other person for having made any other consequential health-care choice: the decision to pursue a potentially fatal course of chemotherapy, for example. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t risk your life! Suicide!&#x201d;) The protesters find it so easy to insult the women who come to me seeking care&#x2014;as if rationally deciding to terminate a pregnancy makes a woman heedless and irresponsible like a child. In my experience, the opposite is true: By the time a woman finds herself in my waiting room she has already walked a long, introspective road. She has had to take a good, hard look at her life. She has taken a world of contradictory and sometimes difficult factors into account. Whatever sex act got her here&#x2014;an intercourse lit by love, passion, lust, hope, indifference, and, yes, sometimes incest or rape&#x2014;is long past and obliterated now by more pressing, pragmatic concerns. It is my personal belief that the abhorrence of abortion expressed by the men who place themselves at the barricades in front of abortion clinics is actually a misplaced horror at women&#x2019;s sexual autonomy. It stands to reason: women&#x2019;s sexual independence is the thing that men have always wanted to control. But for the women in the abortion clinic waiting room, the sex itself is history and totally beside the point. They are here to pursue their lives.<br> <br>Every woman sitting in one of the high-backed chairs in the Montgomery clinic has missed a menstrual period. She has peed on a stick at home or in a public restroom or at a friend&#x2019;s house or in a dorm and seen the result; in a flash she has had to digest how a new child will alter the future she imagines for herself. She has had to decide who she can confide in and who will judge her or disapprove and thus needs to be lied to or kept in the dark. She has confronted whatever private thoughts and yearnings she may have about her vision for her life, including deeply held and possibly heretofore unexamined ideas about professional fulfillment, love, parenthood, and God. She has had to consider the sometimes viselike practicalities that circumscribe her days: school schedules, work demands, the responsibility of caring for other children or ailing relatives, the reliable and supportive presence&#x2014;or not&#x2014;of the person whose sperm entered her body more than six weeks ago, her financial circumstances, her age, the limits of her own health. By the time a woman is sitting in a clinic awaiting my attention, her intention has been focused and clarified. She has figured out how to scrape together $550 if she&#x2019;s six weeks pregnant, or as much as $1,400 if she&#x2019;s further along. She has had to be true to herself, despite the fact that her decision process has been disrupted and corrupted by these new state laws requiring her to be &#x201c;counseled&#x201d;&#x2014;by me, a credentialed doctor, or a psychotherapist&#x2014;in a ginned-up &#x201c;protective&#x201d; encounter that often passes along to these women false or biased information about abortion disguised as scientific truth. In Mississippi, I am required to inform women that having an abortion increases their risk for breast cancer, a fraudulent fact&#x2014;a lie!&#x2014;for which no scientific evidence exists; I tell them what the law requires, and then, in the same breath, I explain to these women that it&#x2019;s simply not true.

She doesn't know it, but her world and ours -- Roundworld -- is in big trouble. On Discworld, a colossal row is brewing<i>.</i>&nbsp;The Wizards of the Unseen University feel responsible for Roundworld (as one would for a pet gerbil). After all, they brought it into existence by bungling an experiment in Quantum ThaumoDynamics. But legal action is being brought against them by Omnians, who say that the Wizards' god-like actions make a mockery of their noble religion. As the finest legal brains in Discworld (a zombie and a priest) gird their loins to do battle -- and when the Great Big Thing in the High Energy Magic Laboratory is switched on -- Marjorie Dawe finds herself thrown across the multiverse and right in the middle of the whole explosive affair.<br><br>As God, the Universe and, frankly, Everything Else is investigated by the trio, you can expect world-bearing elephants, quantum gravity in the Escher-verse, evolutionary design, eternal inflation, dark matter, disbelief systems -- and an in-depth study of how to invent a better mousetrap.</p><p>SIR TERRY PRATCHETT is the acclaimed creator of the global bestselling Discworld series, the first of which, <i>The Colour of Magic</i>, was published in 1983.

The son of an African-American father and a Mexican-American mother, August grew up in the city&#x2019;s Mexicantown and joined the police force only to be drummed out by a conspiracy of corrupt cops and politicians. But August fought back; he took on the city and got himself a $12 million wrongful dismissal settlement that left him low on friends. He has just returned to the house he grew up in after a year away, and quickly learns he has many scores to settle.<br><br>It&#x2019;s not long before he&#x2019;s summoned to the palatial Grosse Pointe Estates home of business magnate Eleanore Paget. Powerful and manipulative, Paget wants August to investigate the increasingly unusual happenings at her private wealth management bank. But detective work is no longer August&#x2019;s beat, and he declines. A day later, Paget is dead of an apparent suicide&#x2014;which August isn&#x2019;t buying for a minute.<br><br>What begins as an inquiry into Eleanore Paget&#x2019;s death soon drags August into a rat&#x2019;s nest of Detroit&#x2019;s most dangerous criminals, from corporate embezzlers to tattooed mercenaries.</p><p>Stephen Mack Jones is a published poet, an award-winning playwright, and a recipient of the prestigious Kresge Arts in Detroit Literary Fellowship. He was born in Lansing, Michigan, and currently lives in Farmington Hills, outside of Detroit. He worked in advertising and marketing communications for a number of years before turning to fiction. <i>August Snow</i> is his first novel.<b>Chapter 1</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The house is a narrow two-story, two-bedroom, redbrick Colonial with two and a half baths, hardwood floors and a small kitchen. The focal point in the living room is a brick fireplace framed by bookshelves. At one time the bookshelves were full of the works of Frederico Garc�a Lorca, Pablo Neruda, Juana In�s de la Cruz, Octavio Paz and Pita Amor. My mother, Isabella Marie Santiago-Snow, would read to me from her favorite poems, her patient voice flowing like warm Juarez honey.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in our house, these poets had to share shelf space with classic noir gumshoes, who stood shoulder-to-hardbound-shoulder with the interminably boring and occasionally grotesque: weighty tomes on police procedure and criminal law, rules of evidence and forensics texts complete with coroner photos of humans in various states of disassembly and decay; there were mysteries by Dashiell Hammett, Arthur Conan Doyle and Raymond Chandler and first-edition signed copies of Rudolph Fisher and Chester Himes. And there were the programs from five August Wilson plays we had seen as a family at the Fischer Theater in downtown Detroit.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After my mother passed away five years ago, the modest brick house in the neighborhood known as Mexicantown, once referred to as &#x201c;La Bagley,&#x201d; became mine.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t what it used to be,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said of our Mexicantown neighborhood. An ornate crucifix she&#x2019;d brought to the hospital hung above her bed while clear liquids dripped into her slowly disappearing body. &#x201c;No one&#x2019;s working. People forced out of homes they lived in for years. Thieves are bolder. Freight trucks cut through neighborhoods where children play in the streets. Sell the house, Octavio. Take the money. Move somewhere else. Forget that place.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lied and said I would. Then we prayed the rosary.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither time nor politics have been kind to Detroit. In Mexicantown, they&#x2019;ve been downright cruel.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1940s, the Mexicans came to Detroit for the same reason blacks had abandoned the south a decade earlier: well-paying, steady work in the auto factories. The only color Henry Ford saw was US Currency Green. He didn&#x2019;t care if you were a spic, an A-rab or a nigger as long as you could tighten a bolt or guide a body onto a chassis. Tighten that bolt, guide that body, get paid.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When word got out that working at Ford and General Motors meant good, steady work and good, steady money, more Mexicans came to Detroit.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contrary to popular belief, Detroit&#x2019;s &#x201c;white flight&#x201d; didn&#x2019;t start in the &#x2019;60s. <i>Gringos </i>have always been &#x201c;flying&#x201d; out of the concentric circles of Detroit. All in an effort to avoid&#x2014;well&#x2014;everybody: The Germans. The Italians. The Irish. Greeks. Swedes. Finns. Blacks. Mexicans. Vietnamese. Now the influx of Chaldeans and Middle<br> East Muslims.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us have our angry and fearsome ghosts in this mad American machine.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mexicantown, homes once reserved for doctors and wheelers-and-dealers were soon bought for pennies on the dollar by waves of Mexicans in pursuit of something once considered the exclusive purview of white people: the American Dream.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the love of my Mexican mother, my African-American father bought the two-story brick Colonial in 1978. He wanted my mother to be close to her family, her friends, her culture. He was an anomaly, a black man living in a Mexican neighborhood. But eventually, through no small amount of effort on my mother&#x2019;s part and the occasion of my birth, he was accepted. Toasted with tequila at Saturday backyard parties and prayed for on Sunday at Holy Redeemer Church&#x2019;s Spanish-language mass.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It didn&#x2019;t hurt that my father was a Detroit cop.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;ve poured some of my settlement money into bringing this house back to life, even going so far as to buy and refurbish seven other houses on Markham Street. The only house I had demolished was one to the north of me, which had once been beautiful but was beyond redemption after two decades of broken crack and meth pipes, heroin needles, attempted &#x201c;Devil&#x2019;s Night&#x201d; arsons, human and animal waste.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A garden on that plot might be nice.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peppers, kale and cabbage, lettuce and tomatoes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#x2019;s a Blaxican without a garden?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially if you can&#x2019;t look with pride on your hard work during the early evening or late night hours, a bottle of Negra Modelo beer or chilled shot of Cabresto Tequila in hand.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I was away, free-diving to the bottom of various bottles of booze around the Mediterranean and Scandinavia, apparently the city thought it would be nice to replace the stripped and gutted streetlamps with eight new solar-powered LED streetlamps. A mostly ineffectual effort to ward off crime on a nearly desolate street in Mexicantown.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;d tried to get on with my life after the trial and award. Live my life as a normal citizen. But I couldn&#x2019;t quite shed the knowledge that I&#x2019;d failed at a job I had loved. A Judas to the apostles in blue. The eyes on me in grocery stores and restaurants, the unrelenting judgment. I was looked at as if there was someone just over my shoulder&#x2014;an out-of-focus and disquieting figure.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everybody loves a hero.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody loves a rat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman I&#x2019;d met in Oslo helped me moderate my drinking. A beautiful young woman with smooth brown skin, a smile like sunrise, and eyes the color of amber. Tatina. She was half-Somali, half-German, a refugee from the perpetual Somali civil war who had seen horrors I couldn&#x2019;t imagine. Somehow her soul had survived, embracing light and exuding warmth. For three months beneath the ice-blue skies of Norway I held her, made love with her, felt my body levitate when she laughed. Her breath on my chest felt like where I needed to be.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It felt like home.<br> Of course, being from Detroit I&#x2019;ve never quite trusted happiness. So I returned to a city where happiness is usually a matter of finding contentment in an acceptable level of intangible fear, unfocused loathing and unexplainable ennui.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was early fall when I found myself back in front of my house on the short, twelve-home street of West Markham in Mexicantown. Nestled against the front door was a small package. Before mounting the steps, I stopped and looked around. A well-fed calico cat stopped in the middle of the street and narrowed its eyes at me as if to say, &#x201c;The fuck you lookin&#x2019; at?&#x201d; before stealthily moving on.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked up the steps then crouched near the box; it was the size and shape of a shoebox and wrapped neatly in brown paper. Even though I&#x2019;d been gone for a year, temperatures were still elevated over my testimony against the former mayor and several Detroit cops&#x2014;now dismissed or imprisoned&#x2014;who had aided the mayor in his various criminal enterprises. A shoebox wrapped in brown paper could very well be a homecoming gift from anybody who was annoyed that I&#x2019;d destroyed careers and made off with a sizable chunk of money from a bankrupt city.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After scrutinizing the package for a minute or so, I carefully lifted it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too light for a bomb. No tell-tale odors. I unwrapped the box and checked for wires. Nothing. Maybe a simple warning inside: A newspaper clipping from the trial with a red X over a photo of me. A stupid note warning me to get out of town by sundown. The clich�d metaphor of a dead rat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lifted the lid.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside was an empty Skittles bag.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I laughed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least <i>somebody </i>was glad I&#x2019;d come home.<br> TWO<br> <b>Chapter 2</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> It&#x2019;s getting so a mackerel snapper can&#x2019;t pray in Detroit.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much to the delight of Lutherans, Baptists, the affluent Catholics of Oakland County and atheists, the Archdiocese of Detroit has closed or merged nearly sixty Catholic churches in the past year, leaving the city&#x2019;s downtown black, Hispanic, elderly and poor Catholics feeling abandoned by a church they had prayed in and tithed to for years. Now, the people who&#x2019;d suffered the most during Detroit&#x2019;s perpetual slide into financial insolvency felt even more marginalized and afraid.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting tenuously on the threshold of closure were Old St. Anne&#x2019;s, a grand Catholic cathedral built over three hundred years ago, and St. Aloysius on Washington Boulevard, with its rose-colored marble columns and semi-circle &#x201c;well&#x201d; revealing the downstairs altar and pews.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I went to St. Al&#x2019;s&#x2014;one, because I like what the Franciscan Brothers do for the homeless and elderly; and two, because, hell or high water, they persist in holding daily afternoon mass regardless of whether one or one hundred worshipers show up. With downtown&#x2019;s recent revitalization, more young white suburban Catholics in Donna Karan and Pierre Cardin suits were taking time out of their lunch schedules to kneel, bow their heads and take communion. Not enough new blood to move the church safely off the closure bubble. But enough for the dioceses to pocket a dollar or two.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of mass, Father Grabowski took me by the elbow and led me to an alcove. &#x201c;Good to see you back, August,&#x201d; he said, a smile forming somewhere inside the thick tangle of his full white beard. Grabowski had known my family for years and he was one of the few priests my father actually trusted. &#x201c;You know you can&#x2019;t buy your way into heaven, though, right?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took it he was referring to the two grand I&#x2019;d dropped into the collection plate, very nearly giving Mr. Lokat, an elderly black layman, a heart attack.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You need it more than I do, Padre,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grabowski nodded enthusiastically, then said, &#x201c;Oh, I didn&#x2019;t say I wasn&#x2019;t gonna take it. In fact if you&#x2019;ve got any loose change left, I&#x2019;ll take that, too. I just said you can&#x2019;t buy your way into heaven.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told Father Grabowski I&#x2019;d just returned from visiting my parents&#x2019; graves. Big Jake, the cemetery groundskeeper, a grizzled black bear of a man, had caught me laying down a bag of cashews, Mom&#x2019;s favorite snack, and pouring out a dram of twenty-one-year-old Auchentoshan single malt scotch for Dad on the grass covering his grave.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old priest nodded. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re always in my evening prayers, August.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, &#x201c;For what I just dropped in the collection plate, Padre, I&#x2019;m thinkin&#x2019; maybe they should be in your morning <i>and </i>afternoon prayers, too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;&#x2018;And again I say unto you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s pretty good,&#x201d; I said playfully. &#x201c;You should write that down.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Matthew, 19:24,&#x201d; Father Grabowski said with a wide, yellow-toothed grin. &#x201c;Yet another reason why you&#x2019;ll never be on <i>Jeopardy</i>, jackass.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like most nuns and priests I&#x2019;d known, Father Grabowski dreamed of being welcomed at the pearly gates by Alex Trebeck. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pulled an errant ten-dollar bill out of my pocket and shoved it into Father Grabowski&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;All I got left. Get yourself a shave, old man.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the twenty or so other faithful who emerged from the Thursday afternoon mass, I discovered there was a car waiting for me outside. The car&#x2014;a new, brightly gleaming navy-blue Ford Taurus with blacked-out windows&#x2014;came equipped with an equally bright and gleaming black driver.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I prayed for you,&#x201d; I said to the tall, slender and well-dressed driver leaning casually on the hood of the car. His expensive cologne, carried on the early fall breeze, had a nose-tingling, eye-stinging cheapness to it. Any cologne smells tawdry if you bathe in it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh yeah?&#x201d; the driver said as he scanned me from head to toe with eyes shielded by a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses. &#x201c;Must not&#x2019;ve worked. I&#x2019;m still alive.&#x201d; The movie-star grin on Detective Lieutenant Leo Cowling&#x2019;s chiseled Abyssinian face disappeared, replaced with a well-practiced scowl. Cowling had been practicing this scowl for upwards of twelve years, ever since we were at the academy together. It still needed practice. &#x201c;See you&#x2019;ve been spendin&#x2019; all the taxpayer&#x2019;s money on threads.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wearing a pair of slightly scuffed brown Bjorn loafers, nicely broken in black Buffalo jeans, a grey Nike sweatshirt and brown leather motorcycle-style jacket that had once belonged to my father.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hardly haute couture, but comfortable as hell.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was also wearing a stylish Glock nine-millimeter semiautomatic that was secured by my belt in the small of my back.<br> My mother would have been appalled that I&#x2019;d brought a gun to church. My father, however, would have considered it necessary any day of the week in the city and twice on Sunday.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the year I&#x2019;d been away from Detroit, I&#x2019;d never felt the need for a gun, save for two very interesting weeks in northeastern India. Back in Detroit, old habits reemerged quickly. My Glock was one of several items I reluctantly retrieved from the storage unit I&#x2019;d packed my life into before I left the country in a concerted effort to die from self-pity and cirrhosis of the liver.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Danbury wants to see you,&#x201d; Cowling said. &#x201c;Get in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s Danbury want?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;How the fuck I know?&#x201d; Cowling&#x2019;s eyebrows creased over his sunglasses and he took several aggressive steps toward me. &#x201c;Get in the car, Tex-Mex.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cowling was maybe an inch or so taller than me and in good shape. I&#x2019;d seen him in the gym at the 14th Precinct. He was quick and could handle a speed-bag pretty well. On the heavy bag, though, he had nothing, his fists buckling at the wrist.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A solid jab to his solar plexus, a right to his jaw and Cowling would be on his ass watching Disney bluebirds flutter around his head. But it would have been a shame to put him down only a few feet from a house of worship.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; I began, squinting up at the diamond-blue early fall sky, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s such a nice day, I think I&#x2019;ll walk.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make me&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Do fucking what?&#x201d; I said, taking a couple steps to close the gap between us. I was already fuel-injected with adrenaline. The key was&#x2014;and always had been&#x2014;to know when to fire up the engine and hit the gas. After a couple seconds of hard stares, I smiled at Cowling, then turned my back on him and began walking west on Washington toward Campus Martius.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#x2019;s the old saying about not being able to go home again?</p><h2>New Believer&#39;s Bible Pocket New Testament NLT (Softcover)</h2><p><strong>NOTE: Font size: 7.57 Pt </strong><br><br>The <em>New Believer&#x2019;s Bible</em> is uniquely designed to help the new Christian read, study, and understand the Bible.

History Main. BOMC &amp; QPB Alt.</p><p>E. P. Sanders moved to Duke University as Arts and Sciences Professor of Religion in 1990.A valuable contribution to the evaluation of our knowledge about Jesus by a noted bible scholar. Sanders (Religion/Duke Univ.) returns to the territory of his well-received Jesus and Judaism (not reviewed) to provide an overview of the history of study of the historical Jesus (as opposed to the Christ of faith). He doesn't advance any startling new claims about Jesus; nor does he assume the biographical stance that A.N. Wilson adopted in his Jesus: A Life (1992); but he does offer his own clear summary of what can be accurately said of Jesus of Nazareth. The so-called quest or search for the historical Jesus began in the late 18th century, in the wake of the Enlightenment, and later engaged Albert Schweitzer, among others. At first, scholars thought the real person was easily discoverable behind the mythic accounts of the Gospels. In the 20th century, it became fashionable, Sanders points out, to say that next to nothing could be known about the man. Sanders himself hews to a middle ground: While admitting the difficulties involved in uncovering the historical reality, he nevertheless claims that one can, with reasonable certainty, say quite a lot that is true about Jesus. Sanders presents an outline of Jesus' life and a discussion of his basic beliefs and teachings. He also traces what he discerns as the course of Jesus' ministry and the events leading up to his execution. He places Jesus in both the political setting of the backwater province of the Roman Empire (Judea was then ruled by a fairly independent Herod) and the Judaism of his time. His discussion of the miracles attributed to the man is set against a backdrop of acceptance of magic and miracles generally in the ancient world. Highly readable, this book will be of interest to scholars and accessible to general readers as well.

They were cousins, on a pilgrimage to see their childhood homes; their families had been driven out of Palestine nearly twenty years earlier. One cousin had a door slammed in his face, and another found his old house had been converted into a school. But the third, Bashir Al-Khairi, was met at the door by a young woman called Dalia, who invited them in.</p><p>This act of faith in the face of many years of animosity is the starting point for a true story of a remarkable relationship between two families, one Arab, one Jewish, amid the fraught modern history of the regio. In his childhood home, in the lemon tree his father planted in the backyard, Bashir sees dispossession and occupation; Dalia, who arrived as an infant in 1948 with her family from Bulgaria, sees hope for a people devastated by the Holocaust. As both are swept up in the fates of their people, and Bashir is jailed for his alleged part in a supermarket bombing, the friends do not speak for years. They finally reconcile and convert the house in Ramle into a day-care centre for Arab children of Israel, and a center for dialogue between Arabs and Jews. Now the dialogue they started seems more threatened than ever; the lemon tree died in 1998, and Bashir was jailed again, without charge.</p><p>The Lemon Tree grew out of a forty-three minute radio documentary that Sandy Tolan produced for Fresh Air. With this book, he pursues the story into the homes and histories of the two families at its center, and up to the present day. Their stories form a personal microcosm of the last seventy years of Israeli-Palestinian history. In a region that seems ever more divided, The Lemon Tree is a reminder of all that is at stake, and of all that is still possible.</p></p><p>In the summer of 1967, Bashir   a young Palestinian man   knocks on the door of his childhood home in the town of Ramla in Israel, a home from which his family was driven some twenty years earlier. The door is opened by a young Jewish woman, Dalia, whose family settled in the house after fleeing persecution in Bulgaria at the end of the Second World War. Thus begins an unlikely and difficult friendship, which bridges religious divides and lasts more than four decades. The Lemon Tree tells the story of this extraordinary friendship and offers a much needed human perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Is Irene being paranoid, or is she next on the killer&#x2019;s list?</p><p>Helene Tursten was a nurse and a dentist before she turned to writing. Other books in the Irene Huss series include <i>Detective Inspector Huss</i>, <i>Night Rounds</i>, <i>The Torso</i>, <i>The Glass Devil</i>, <i>The Golden Calf</i>, <i>The Fire Dance</i>, <i>The Beige Man</i>, <i>The Treacherous Net</i>, and <i>Protected by the Shadows</i>. Her books have been translated into 18 languages and made into a television series. She was born in G�teborg, Sweden, where she now lives with her husband.Thin veils of mist lingered in the glow of the street lamps, but soon they would disperse completely. The gusts of wind were getting stronger all the time, carrying the first drops of rain. Dampness clung to her face as she leaned forward, fighting her way across the parking lot. Nobody was out and about without good reason; even the dog owners in the area seemed to have abandoned the idea of a last walk. The neighborhood was dark and silent; most people had already gone to bed. Only Bosse Gunnarsson&#x2019;s kitchen window showed a warm, inviting light. He was sitting at the table with a sudoku puzzle as usual, his reading glasses slipping down his nose.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her own house lay in darkness, but she would soon change that. Switch on the lamps, make a cup of tea, fix herself an egg and caviar sandwich. Light some candles on the coffee table. Wrap herself in a thick, soft blanket and watch the late news. Then off to bed, she promised herself. She reached into the mailbox: nothing but bills and flyers.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She continued toward the door, searching in her purse for the key. As she was about to insert it in the lock, she noticed a rapid movement in the darkness by the shed. Suddenly someone was right behind her. An iron grip around her chest pressed her close to her attacker&#x2019;s torso, forcing the breath out of her body. She was paralyzed by the man&#x2019;s strength and by the acrid stench emanating from him. Only when she realized what he was doing did she manage to offer some resistance. The man was using his free hand to try to loop something around her neck but was having difficulty getting it over her head&#x2014;not because he was so much shorter than her, but because she was struggling, twisting from side to side as she tried to free herself from his grip. He growled and hissed something unintelligible but managed to hang on to her. After a brief battle he had the noose where he wanted it. Instinctively she reached up and slid one hand under the twine. The attack itself had been so sudden that she hadn&#x2019;t had time to scream. She tried to call for help, but the only sound that came out was a faint whimper; the noose had already been drawn too tight. She felt him loosen his hold on her body so he could put more force into the act of strangulation. Even if she could manage to keep her hand between her throat and the twine, she was getting hardly any air. The darkness flickered before her eyes, and she realized that she would soon lose consciousness.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She managed to slip her other hand into her pocket and rummaged around feverishly. Paper tissues, a box of painkillers, her cigarette lighter . . . Wasn&#x2019;t it there? It must be there! She panicked even more, her movements growing clumsy. Was it in the wrong pocket? The pain in her throat was unbearable. She couldn&#x2019;t breathe.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All at once she felt the car key against her fingertips. She managed to find the little cylinder attached to the key ring and grasped it with trembling fingers. Her thumb slipped on her first attempt, but she could feel the button. Summoning up the last reserves of her strength, she pressed it again.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The screech of the attack alarm sliced through the silent neighborhood. She felt her attacker stiffen, and for a few vital seconds he lost concentration. She lifted one foot and kicked backward as hard as she could. The heel of her leather boot caught him just below the knee. He doubled over and groaned, loosening his grip for a fraction of a second. At the same time, she heard Bosse Gunnarsson open his door and yell:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What the hell is going on out there? I&#x2019;m calling the cops!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the presence behind her was gone. She heard the crack of the gate as he f lung it open and disappeared in the direction of the parking lot.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hey, stop right there! What are you doing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bosse&#x2019;s voice again. Thank God for Bosse. She sank to the ground, trying to call for help, but all that emerged was a pathetic croak.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had survived. She was alive!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Panic had locked her hand around the slim cylinder in a vise-like grip. She couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to let go of the object that had saved her life.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The screech of the alarm stopped abruptly as the darkness<br> closed around her.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> Under normal circumstances Irene Huss was not a morning person, but there were days when she seriously considered trying to become one. Mornings like this, for example. The air was crystal clear, with a hint of crispness left over from the chill of the night. Above the horizon an amazing sunrise filled the sky with intense shades of gold. Could there be a more perfect start to the day?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drew her robe more tightly around her body as she paused on the top step and inhaled deeply. The moisture from last night&#x2019;s rain intensified the smells. The garden looked as if it had just woken up feeling refreshed. The luxuriant asters glowed deep red in the cast-iron urns on either side of the steps, a final defiant protest against the inexorable approach of the fall.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She padded down to the low gate in her slippers, leaned over and took the newspaper out of the mailbox on the fence. As she turned to go back indoors, she stopped dead. It took a few seconds before she realized that the small garden seat that normally stood between the two kitchen windows had been moved and was now in the middle of the f lower bed beneath one window. The newly planted rose bushes were badly damaged: several branches were broken. Annoyed, Irene picked up the seat and put it back against the wall. Strange&#x2014;it had been there yesterday evening, hadn&#x2019;t it?<br>&#x201c;I think so,&#x201d; Krister said when she asked him a little later.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was standing at the stove cooking eggs, with crisply fried bacon and halved tomatoes piled on a plate beside him. As far as Irene was concerned, preparing such a hearty breakfast was a total waste of time. Three cups of black coffee and a couple of cheese sandwiches had been her standard start to the day for decades, but now her husband had decided that this was unacceptable. Perhaps it was, but it suited her. When she wondered how fried eggs and bacon could be regarded as healthy in view of the bad cholesterol involved, he had waved away the argument: &#x201c;GI foods! A whole world of dieters can&#x2019;t be wrong!&#x201d; To tell the truth, Krister was the one who needed to lose weight, not Irene.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put a plate of GI breakfast in front of her. As usual she could only manage to push the food around. At times like these she was seriously tempted to turn vegan, like Jenny. Their daughter had stuck to her principles for almost ten years and was now in Amsterdam, training to be a chef specializing<br> in vegan dishes. Jenny was following in her father&#x2019;s footsteps, but perhaps not exactly the way Krister had expected. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But you have to admit it&#x2019;s weird, the seat being moved,&#x201d; Irene persisted.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s probably just Viktor and his pals fooling around.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why would Viktor . . . You could be right.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy next door was ten years old, and he and his friends were always running around the neighborhood. As far as Irene could tell, they all seemed to get along with everyone, and she hadn&#x2019;t heard of them getting into any serious trouble. She found it difficult to imagine why they would have picked up a seat and thrown it into the rose bed; it seemed completely pointless. The kitchen window was so low that Viktor could easily look through it if he wanted to; he wouldn&#x2019;t even need to stand on tiptoe.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shook her head and poured her third cup of coffee.<br> The following morning Irene woke at seven, despite the fact that it was Saturday, and she didn&#x2019;t have to go to work. Krister had worked late at the restaurant the previous night, and the soft, regular breathing from the bed beside her suggested that he would remain deeply asleep for quite some time. She crept out of the warmth of the covers. When she had finished in the bathroom she put on her running gear, automatically reaching for her knee brace. Her knee was too painful if she didn&#x2019;t use it these days. I&#x2019;m starting to fall apart, she thought gloomily.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She opened the door and jogged down the steps, then stopped and stared straight ahead. Slowly she turned around.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glorious asters had been torn out of their urns and lay strewn all over the lawn.<br> &#x201c;Viktor would never do such a thing!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malin, who was Irene&#x2019;s neighbor and Viktor&#x2019;s mother, folded her arms and looked deeply insulted. Irene tried to adopt a conciliatory tone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;To be honest I don&#x2019;t think he would either, but . . .&#x201d; she began.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So why have you come here accusing him, then?&#x201d; Malin snapped.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was not good for neighborly relations, Irene realized. Nor did it constitute a successful interrogation, her professional side noted.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not accusing him, I just wanted to eliminate the possibility and ask him if he knew anything,&#x201d; Irene tried to explain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Fucking police abuse!&#x201d; Malin yelled as she slammed the door.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police abuse? Presumably she meant abuse of power. To a certain extent Irene could understand why Malin was upset, but if she was so sure of her son&#x2019;s innocence, why was she reacting so strongly?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if in response to Irene&#x2019;s train of thought, Viktor came ambling along the street. He opened the gate and grinned at her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hi!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hi, Viktor. Listen, I just came to ask your mom something, but she got real mad at me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viktor&#x2019;s grin disappeared and he looked anxiously at her. Irene gave him an encouraging smile. &#x201c;The thing is, someone&#x2019;s being doing weird stuff in our garden. They&#x2019;ve moved a seat and pulled up some f lowers. I just wanted to ask if you know anything about it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy shook his head; he looked genuinely surprised.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irene looked him in the eye and smiled again. His expression was still a little uncertain, but he returned the smile. A guilty ten-year-old wouldn&#x2019;t look that way.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viktor wasn&#x2019;t behind the vandalism.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So who was?</p><h2>Smoke From This Altar (The Louis L&#39;Amour Collection)</h2><p>NEW!

Sawyer is the Nebula Award-winning author of <i>The Terminal Experiment</i>. He lives in a suburb of Toronto, Ontario.Hominids<br>Chapter OneDAY ONE FRIDAY, AUGUST 2 148/103/24The blackness was absolute.Watching over it was Louise Beno�t, twenty-eight, a statuesque postdoc from Montreal with a mane of thick brown hair stuffed, as required here, into a hair net. She kept her vigil in a cramped control room, buried two kilometers--"a mile an' a quarder," as she sometimes explained for American visitors in an accent that charmed them--beneath the Earth's surface.The control room was next to the deck above the vast, unilluminated cavern housing the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. Suspended in the center of that cavern was the world's largest acrylic sphere, twelve meters--"almost fordy feet"--across. The sphere was filled with eleven hundred tonnes of heavy water on loan from Atomic Energy of Canada Limited.Enveloping that transparent globe was a geodesic array of stainless-steel struts, supporting 9,600 photomultiplier tubes, each cupped in a reflective parabola, each aimed in toward the sphere. All of this--the heavy water, the acrylic globe that contained it, and the enveloping geodesic shell--was housed in a ten-story-tall barrel-shaped cavern, excavated from the surrounding norite rock. And that gargantuancavern was filled almost to the top with ultrapure regular water.The two kilometers of Canadian shield overhead, Louise knew, protected the heavy water from cosmic rays. And the shell of regular water absorbed the natural background radiation from the small quantities of uranium and thorium in the surrounding rock, preventing that, too, from reaching the heavy water. Indeed, nothing could penetrate into the heavy water except neutrinos, those infinitesimal subatomic particles that were the subject of Louise's research. Trillions of neutrinos passed right through the Earth every second; in fact, a neutrino could travel through a block of lead a light-year thick with only a fifty-percent chance of hitting something.Still, neutrinos poured out of the sun in such vast profusion that collisions did occasionally occur--and heavy water was an ideal target for such collisions. The hydrogen nuclei in heavy water each contain a proton--the normal constituent of a hydrogen nucleus--plus a neutron, as well. And when a neutrino did chance to hit a neutron, the neutron decayed, releasing a proton of its own, an electron, and a flash of light that could be detected by the photomultiplier tubes.At first, Louise's dark, arching eyebrows did not rise when she heard the neutrino-detection alarm go <i>ping,</i> the alarm sounded briefly about a dozen times a day, and although it was normally the most exciting thing to happen down here, it still didn't merit looking up from her copy of <i>Cosmopolitan</i>.But then the alarm sounded again, and yet again, andthen it stayed on, a solid, unending electric bleep like a dying man's EKG.Louise got up from her desk and walked over to the detector console. On top of it was a framed picture of Stephen Hawking--not signed, of course. Hawking had visited the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory for its grand opening a few years ago, in 1998. Louise tapped on the alarm's speaker, in case it was on the fritz, but the keening continued.Paul Kiriyama, a scrawny grad student, dashed into the control room, arriving from elsewhere in the vast, underground facility. Paul was, Louise knew, usually quite flustered around her, but this time he wasn't at a loss for words. "What the heck's going on?" he asked. There was a grid of ninety-eight by ninety-eight LEDs on the detector panel, representing the 9,600 photomultiplier tubes; every one of them was illuminated."Maybe someone accidentally turned on the lights in the cavern," said Louise, sounding dubious even to herself.The prolonged bleep finally stopped. Paul pressed a couple of buttons, activating five TV monitors slaved to five underwater cameras inside the observatory chamber. Their screens were perfectly black rectangles. "Well, if the lights <i>were</i> on," he said, "they're off now. I wonder what--""A supernova!" declared Louise, clapping her long-fingered hands together. "We should contact the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams; establish our priority." Although SNO had been built to study neutrinos from the sun, it could detect them from anywhere in the universe.Paul nodded and plunked himself down in front of aWeb browser, clicking on the bookmark for the Bureau's site. It was worth reporting the event, Louise knew, even if they weren't yet sure.A new series of pings sounded from the detector panel. Louise looked at the LED board; several hundred lights were illuminated all over the grid. Strange, she thought. A supernova should register as a <i>directional</i> source ..."Maybe something's wrong with the equipment?" said Paul, clearly reaching the same conclusion. "Or maybe the connection to one of the photomultipliers is shorting out, and the others are picking up the arc."The air split with a creaking, groaning sound, coming from next door--from the deck atop the giant detector chamber itself. "Perhaps we should turn on the chamber lights," said Louise. The groaning continued, a subterranean beast prowling in the dark."But what if it is a supernova?" said Paul. "The detector is useless with the lights on, and--"Another loud cracking, like a hockey player making a slap shot. "Turn on the lights!"Paul lifted the protective cover on the switch and pressed it. The images on the TV monitors flared then settled down, showing--<i>"Mon dieu,"</i> declared Louise."There's something inside the heavy-water tank!" said Paul. "But how could--?""Did you see that?" said Louise. "It's moving, and--good Lord, it's a man!"The cracking and groaning sounds continued, and then--They could see it on the monitors and hear it coming through the walls.The giant acrylic sphere burst apart along several of the seams that held its component pieces together. <i>"Tabernacle,"</i> Louise swore, realizing the heavy water must now be mixing with the regular H2O inside the barrel-shaped chamber. Her heart was jackhammering. For half a second, she didn't know whether to be more concerned about the destruction of the detector or about the man who was obviously drowning inside it."Come on!" said Paul, heading for the door leading to the deck above the observatory chamber. The cameras were slaved to VCRs; nothing would be missed.<i>"Un moment,"</i> said Louise. She dashed across the control room, grabbed a telephone handset, and pounded out an extension from the list taped to the wall.The phone rang twice. "Dr. Montego?" said Louise, when the Jamaican-accented voice of the mine-site physician came on. "Louise Beno�t here, at SNO. We need you right away down at the neutrino observatory. There's a man drowning in the detector chamber.""A man drowning?" said Montego. "But how could he possibly get in there?""We don't know. Hurry!""I'm on my way," said the doctor. Louise replaced the handset and ran toward the same blue door Paul had gone through earlier, which had since swung shut. She knew the signs on it by heart:Keep Door Closed Danger: High Voltage Cables No Unauthorized Electronic Equipment Beyond This Point Air Quality Checked--Cleared for EntryLouise grabbed the handle, pulling the door open, and hurried onto the wide expanse of the metal deck.There was a trapdoor off to one side leading down to the actual detector chamber; the final construction worker had exited through it, and had sealed it shut behind him. To Louise's astonishment, the trapdoor was still sealed by forty separate bolts--of course, it was <i>supposed</i> to be sealed, but there was no way a man could have gotten inside except through that trapdoor ...The walls surrounding the deck were covered with dark green plastic sheeting to keep rock dust out. Dozens of conduits and polypropylene pipes hung from the ceiling, and steel girders sketched out the shape of the room. Computing equipment lined some walls; others had shelves. Paul was over by one of the latter, desperately rummaging around, presumably for pliers strong enough to crank the bolts free.Metal screamed in anguish. Louise ran toward the trapdoor--not that there was anything she could do to unseal it with her bare hands. Her heart leapt; a sound like machine-gun fire erupted into the room as the restraining bolts shot into the air. The trapdoor burst open, slapping back on its hinges and hitting the deck with a reverberating clang. Louise had jumped out of the way, but a geyser of cold water leapt up through the opening, soaking her.The very top of the detector chamber was filled with nitrogen gas, which Louise knew must be venting now. The water spout quickly subsided. She moved toward the opening in the deck and looked down, trying not to breathe. The interior was illuminated by the floodlights Paul hadturned on, and the water was absolutely pure; Louise could see all the way to the bottom, thirty meters below.She could just make out the giant curving sections of the acrylic sphere; the acrylic's index of refraction was almost identical to that of water, making it hard to see. The sections, separated from each other now, were anchored to the roof by synthetic-fiber cables; otherwise, they would have already sunk to the bottom of the surrounding geodesic shell. The trapdoor's opening gave only a limited perspective, and Louise couldn't yet see the drowning man.<i>"Merde!"</i> The lights inside the chamber had gone off. "Paul!" Louise shouted. "What are you doing?"Paul's voice--now coming from back in the control room--was barely audible above the air-conditioning equipment and the sloshing of the water in the huge cavern beneath Louise's feet. "If that man's still alive," he shouted, "he'll see the lights up on the deck through the trapdoor."Louise nodded. The only thing the man would now be seeing was a single illuminated square, a meter on a side, in what, to him, would be a vast, dark ceiling.A moment later, Paul returned to the deck. Louise looked at him, then back down at the open trapdoor. There was still no sign of the man. "One of us should go in," said Louise.Paul's almond-shaped eyes went wide. "But ... the heavy water--""There's nothing else to do," said Louise. "How good a swimmer are you?"Paul looked embarrassed; the last thing he ever wanted to do, Louise knew, was look bad in her eyes, but ... "Not very," he said, dropping his gaze.It was already awkward enough down here with Paul mooning over her all the time, but Louise couldn't very well swim in her SNO-issue blue-nylon jumpsuit. Underneath, though, like almost everyone else who worked at SNO, she only had on her underwear; the temperature was a tropical 40.6 Celsius this far beneath Earth's surface. She yanked off her shoes, then pulled on the zipper that ran down the front of the jumpsuit; thank God she'd worn a bra today--although she wished now that it hadn't been as lacy."Turn the lights back on down there," said Louise. To his credit, Paul didn't tarry. Before he'd returned, Louise had slipped through the trapdoor into the cold water; the water was chilled to ten degrees Celsius to discourage biological growth and to reduce the spontaneous noise rate of the photomultiplier tubes.She felt a rush of panic, a sudden feeling of being a long way up with nothing supporting her; the bottom was far, far below. She was treading water, her head and shoulders sticking up through the open trapdoor into the air, waiting for her panic to subside. When it did, she took three deep breaths, closed her mouth tight, and dived beneath the surface.Louise could see clearly, and her eyes didn't sting at all. She looked around, trying to spot the man, but there were so many pieces of acrylic, and--<i>There he was.</i>He had indeed floated up, and there was a small gap--maybe fifteen centimeters--between the top of the water and the deck above. Normally it was filled with ultrapure nitrogen. The poor guy <i>must</i> be dead; three breaths of that would be fatal. A sad irony: he probably fought his way to the surface, thinking he could find air, only to be killed by the gas he inhaled there. Breathable air from the open trapdoor must now be mixing with the nitrogen, but presumably it was too late to help him.Louise pushed her own head and shoulders up through the trapdoor again. She could see Paul, desperately waiting for her to say something--anything. But there was no time for that. She gulped more air, filling her lungs as much as she could, then dived under. There wasn't enough room for her to keep her nose above water without constantly banging her head into the metal roof as she swam. The man was about ten meters away. Louise kicked her feet, covering the distance as quickly as she could, and--A cloud in the water. Something dark.<i>Mon dieu!</i>It was blood.The cloud surrounded the man's head, obscuring his features. He wasn't moving at all; if he were still alive, he was surely unconscious.Louise craned to get her mouth and nose into the air gap. She took one tentative breath--but there was plenty of breathable air there now--then grabbed the man's arm. Louise rolled the fellow over--he'd been floating facedown--so that his nose was sticking up into the air gap, but it seemed to make no difference. There was no spluttering from him, no sign that he was still breathing.Louise dragged him through the water. It was tough work: the man was quite stocky, and he was fully dressed; his clothes were waterlogged. Louise didn't have time to notice much, but it did register on her that the man <i>wasn't</i> wearing coveralls or safety boots. He couldn't possibly be one of the nickel miners, and although Louise had only gotten a fleeting glimpse of the man's face--a white guy, blond beard--he wasn't from SNO, either.Paul must have been crouching on the deck above. Louise could see his head sticking into the water; he was watching as Louise and the man came closer. Under other circumstances, Louise would have gotten the injured person out of the water before she herself left it, but the trapdoor was only big enough for one of them to go through at a time, and it would take both her and Paul to drag this large man out.Louise let go of the man's arm and stuck her head up through the trapdoor, Paul having now backed off from it. She took a moment just to breathe; she was exhausted from pulling the man through the water. And then she put her palms flat on the wet deck and began to lift herself up and out. Paul crouched down again and helped Louise onto the deck, then they turned back to the man.He had started to drift away, but Louise managed to grab his arm and drag him back under the opening. Louise and Paul then struggled to get him out, finally succeeding in lifting him onto the deck. He was still bleeding; the injury was clearly to the side of his head.Paul immediately knelt next to the man and began administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, his cheek gettingslick with blood each time he turned to see if the man's broad chest was rising.Louise, meanwhile, found the man's right wrist and searched for a pulse. There didn't--no, no, wait! There was! There <i>was</i> a pulse.Paul continued to blow air into the man's mouth, over and over again, ...</p><h2>The Pearl Sister: Book Four (4) (The Seven Sisters)</h2><p><b>From the breathtaking beaches of Thailand to the barely tamed wilds of colonial Australia, <i>The Pearl Sister </i>is the next captivating story in <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Lucinda Riley&#x2019;s epic series about two women searching for a place to call home.</b><br><br>CeCe D&#x2019;Apli�se has always felt like an outcast.

Visit her online at LucindaRiley.com.The Pearl Sister 1<p></p> <br>I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when I heard that my father had died, I thought to myself as I stared out of the window and saw the complete blackness of night. Intermittently below me, there were small clusters of twinkling lights indicating human habitation, each light containing a life, a family, a set of friends . . .<br> <br>None of which I felt I had any longer.<br> <br>It was almost like seeing the world upside down, because the lights below the plane resembled less brilliant facsimiles of the stars above me. This reminded me of the fact that one of my tutors at art college had once told me that I painted as if I couldn&#x2019;t see what was in front of me. He was right. I couldn&#x2019;t. The pictures appeared in my mind, not in reality. Often, they didn&#x2019;t take animal, mineral, or even human form, but the images were strong, and I always felt compelled to follow them through.<br> <br>Like that great pile of junk I&#x2019;d collected from scrap yards around London and housed in my studio at the apartment. I had spent weeks trying to work out exactly how all the pieces should be placed together. It was like working on a giant Rubik&#x2019;s Cube, though the raw ingredients were comprised of a smelly oil can, an old Guy Fawkes scarecrow, a tire, and a rusting metal pickax. I&#x2019;d constantly moved the bits into place, happy right up until I added that last vital piece, which always&#x2014;wherever I put it&#x2014;seemed to ruin the entire installation.<br> <br>I laid my hot brow against the cool Perspex of the window, which was all that separated me and everyone else on the plane from asphyxiation and certain death.<br> <br>We are so vulnerable . . .<br> <br>No, CeCe, I cautioned myself harshly as panic rose inside me, you can do this without her, you really can.<br> <br>I forced my thoughts back to Pa Salt, because given my ingrained fear of flying, thinking about the moment I heard he&#x2019;d died was&#x2014;in a weird way&#x2014;comforting. If the worst happened and the plane dropped from the sky, killing us all, at least he might be there on the other side, waiting for me. He&#x2019;d already made the journey up there, after all. And he&#x2019;d made it alone, as we all did.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d been pulling on my jeans when the call had come from my younger sister Tiggy, telling me that Pa Salt was dead. Looking back now, I was pretty sure that none of what she said really sank in. All I could think of was how I&#x2019;d tell Star, who had adored our father. I knew she would be totally devastated.<br> <br>You adored him too, CeCe . . .<br> <br>And I had. Since my role in life was to protect my more vulnerable sister&#x2014;she was actually three months older than me but she&#x2019;d found it difficult to speak, so I&#x2019;d always spoken for her&#x2014;I&#x2019;d sealed up my heart, zipped up my jeans, then walked into the sitting room to tell her.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d said nothing, just wept in my arms. I&#x2019;d done everything I could to keep my own tears at bay. For her, for Star. I&#x2019;d had to be strong because she&#x2019;d needed me . . .<br> <br>That was then . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;Madam, is there something you need?&#x201d;<br> <br>A cloud of musky perfume descended from above me. I looked up and saw the stewardess leaning over me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Er, no thanks.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You pressed the call bell,&#x201d; she said in an exaggerated whisper, indicating the rest of the passengers, who were all asleep. After all, it was four in the morning, London time.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I whispered back, as I removed my offending elbow from the button that had alerted her. Typical. She gave me the kind of nod I remembered one of my teachers had given me when she&#x2019;d seen me opening my eyes during morning prayer at school. Then, with a rustle of silk, the stewardess disappeared back to her lair. I did my best to make myself comfortable and close my eyes, wanting to be like the four hundred or so random souls who had managed to escape from the horror of hurtling through the air in an aluminum tube by going to sleep. As usual, I felt left out, not part of the crowd.<br> <br>Of course, I could have booked into business class. I still had some money left from my legacy&#x2014;but not enough that I wanted to waste it on just another few centimeters of room. Most of my money had gone toward buying the swanky riverside apartment for me and Star in London. I&#x2019;d thought that a proper home was what she&#x2019;d wanted, that it would make her happy, but it so hadn&#x2019;t . . .<br> <br>Now here I was, no farther on than this time last year when I&#x2019;d sat next to my sister in economy class, flying across the world to Thailand. Except this time Star wasn&#x2019;t with me, and I wasn&#x2019;t running to something, I was running away . . .<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Would you like breakfast, madam?&#x201d;<br> <br>I opened my eyes, feeling groggy and disoriented, and stared up at the same stewardess who had visited me in the middle of the night. I saw that all the cabin lights were on and some of the window blinds were open, revealing the pink hue of dawn.<br> <br>&#x201c;No thanks, just coffee. Black, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>She nodded and retreated, and I wondered why&#x2014;given I was paying for this entire experience&#x2014;I felt guilty about asking for anything.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are you headed?&#x201d;<br> <br>I turned to face my neighbor, whom I&#x2019;d only viewed in profile up until now. And even then, it had been a nose, a mouth, and a lock of blond hair hanging out of a black hoodie. Now he was full frontal, staring at me. He was probably no more than eighteen, the traces of adolescent acne still visible on his chin and forehead. I felt ancient next to him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bangkok, then on to Australia.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cool,&#x201d; he commented as he tucked into his prison-issue tray of inedible scrambled eggs, over-fried bacon, and a long pink thing that was masquerading as a sausage. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll head there eventually, but I&#x2019;m gonna check out Thailand first. I&#x2019;ve been told the Full Moon Parties are something else.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They are.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You been?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A few times,&#x201d; I replied, his question immediately downloading a selection of memories in my mind.<br> <br>&#x201c;Which one do you suggest? Heard Ko Pha Ngan is the best.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been ages since I went there last, but I hear it&#x2019;s huge now&#x2014;maybe a couple of thousand people. My favorite place is Railay Beach in Krabi. It&#x2019;s very chilled, but I suppose it depends on what you want.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Heard of Krabi,&#x201d; he said, his jaw working overtime to chew the sausage. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m meeting my mates in Bangkok. We&#x2019;ve still got a couple of weeks until the full moon to decide anyway. You meeting friends out in Oz?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I lied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stopping over in Bangkok for a while?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just the night.&#x201d;<br> <br>I sensed his excitement as the plane began its descent into Suvarnabhumi Airport and the usual set of instructions was issued by the cabin staff for us captives. It&#x2019;s all a joke, really, I thought as I closed my eyes and tried to still my banging heart. If the plane crashed, we would all die instantly, whether or not my tray table was in the upright position. I supposed they had to say this stuff to make us feel better.<br> <br>The plane touched down so gently I hardly knew we were on the ground until they announced it over the PA system. I opened my eyes and felt a surge of triumph. I&#x2019;d completed a long-haul flight alone and lived to tell the tale. Star would be proud of me . . . if she even cared any longer.<br> <br>Having gone through immigration, I collected my baggage from the carousel and trooped toward the exit.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have a great time in Oz,&#x201d; called my teenage neighbor as he caught up with me. &#x201c;My mate says the wildlife there is insane, spiders the size of dinner plates! See ya!&#x201d;<br> <br>With a wave, he disappeared into the mass of humanity. I followed him outside at a much slower pace and a familiar wall of humid heat hit me. I caught the airport shuttle bus to the hotel I&#x2019;d booked into for my overnight stop, checked in, and took the lift up to my sterile room. Heaving my rucksack off my shoulders, I sat on the white bedsheets and thought that if I owned a hotel, I&#x2019;d provide my guests with dark sheets that didn&#x2019;t show the stains of other bodies on them the way white does, no matter how hard you scrub.<br> <br>There were so many things in the world that puzzled me, rules that had been made by someone somewhere, probably a long time ago. I took off my hiking boots and lay down, thinking I could be anywhere in the world, and I hated it. The air-con unit hummed above me and I closed my eyes and tried to sleep, but all I could think about was that if I died right now, not a single human being would know I had.<br> <br>I understood then what loneliness really was. It felt like a gnawing inside me, yet at the same time, a great hole of emptiness. I blinked away tears&#x2014;I&#x2019;d never been a crier&#x2014;but they kept coming, so that eventually my eyelids were forced to open with the pressure of what felt like a dam about to burst.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s okay to cry, CeCe, really . . .<br> <br>I heard Ma&#x2019;s comforting voice in my head and remembered her telling me that when I fell out of a tree at Atlantis and sprained my ankle. I&#x2019;d bitten my bottom lip so hard in my effort not to be a crybaby that I&#x2019;d drawn blood.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;d care,&#x201d; I murmured hopelessly, then reached for my mobile and thought about turning it on and texting Ma to tell her where I was. But I couldn&#x2019;t hack seeing a message from Star, or, even worse, seeing no message from her at all. I knew that would break me, so I threw the phone across the bed and tried to close my eyes again. But then an image of Pa appeared behind my eyelids and wouldn&#x2019;t go away.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s important that you and Star make your own friends, as well as having each other, CeCe . . .<br> <br>He&#x2019;d said that just before we&#x2019;d gone to the University of Sussex together, and I&#x2019;d been cross because I didn&#x2019;t need anyone else, and neither did Star. Or at least, I hadn&#x2019;t thought she did. Then . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, Pa,&#x201d; I sighed, &#x201c;is it better up there?&#x201d;<br> <br>In the past few weeks, as Star had made it clear she wasn&#x2019;t interested in being with me anymore, I&#x2019;d found myself talking to Pa a lot. His death just didn&#x2019;t seem real; I still felt him close to me, somehow. Even though outwardly I couldn&#x2019;t have been more opposite to Tiggy, my next sister down, with all her weird spiritual beliefs, there was this odd part of me that knew and felt things too . . . in my gut and in my dreams. Often it felt like my dream time was more real and vivid than when I was awake&#x2014;a bit like watching a series on TV. Those were the good nights, because I had nightmares too. Like the ones with the enormous spiders . . .<br> <br>I shuddered, remembering my teenage plane companion&#x2019;s parting words . . . They couldn&#x2019;t really be the size of dinner plates in Australia, could they?<br> <br>&#x201c;Christ!&#x201d; I jumped out of bed to halt my thoughts, and washed my face in the bathroom. I looked at my reflection, and with my eyes pink and swollen from crying and my hair slick with grease after the long journey, I decided I looked like a baby wild boar.<br> <br>It didn&#x2019;t matter how many times Ma had told me how beautiful and unusual the shape and color of my eyes were, or Star had said how much she liked to stroke my skin, which was&#x2014;in her words&#x2014;as smooth and soft as cocoa butter. I knew they were just being kind, because I wasn&#x2019;t blind as well as ugly&#x2014;and I hated being patronized about my looks. Given I had five beautiful sisters, I&#x2019;d gone out of my way not to compete with them. Electra&#x2014;who just happened to be a supermodel&#x2014;was constantly telling me that I wasn&#x2019;t making the best of myself but it was a waste of time and energy, because I was never going to be beautiful.<br> <br>However, I could create beauty, and now, at my lowest ebb, I remembered something else that Pa had once said to me when I was younger.<br> <br>Whatever happens to you in life, darling CeCe, the one thing that can never be taken away from you is your talent.<br> <br>At the time, I thought it was just another&#x2014;what&#x2019;s the word Star would use?&#x2014;platitude to make up for the fact that I was basically crap looks-wise, crap academically, and crap with people. And actually, Pa was wrong, because even if other people couldn&#x2019;t take talent away from you, they could destroy your confidence with their negative comments and mess with your brain, so you didn&#x2019;t know who you were anymore or how to please anyone, least of all yourself. That was what had happened to me on my art course. Which was why I&#x2019;d left.<br> <br>At least I learned what I wasn&#x2019;t good at, I comforted myself. Which, according to my tutors, was most of the modules I&#x2019;d taken in the past three months.<br> <br>Despite the battering my paintings and I had received, even I knew that if I lost faith in my talent now, then there wasn&#x2019;t any point in carrying on. It really was all I had left.<br> <br>I went back into the bedroom and lay down again, just wanting these awful lonely hours to pass, and finally understanding why I saw so many old people sitting on benches whenever I walked through Battersea Park on my way to college. Even if it was freezing outside, they needed to confirm that there were other human beings on the planet, and that they weren&#x2019;t completely alone.<br> <br>I must have fallen asleep, because I had the spider nightmare and woke myself up screaming, automatically clapping a hand to my mouth to shut myself up in case someone along the corridor thought I was being murdered. I decided I just couldn&#x2019;t stay in this soulless room any longer by myself, so I put on my boots, grabbed my camera, and took the lift down to reception.<br> <br>Outside, there was a queue of waiting taxis. I climbed into the back of one and directed the driver to the Grand Palace. It had always amused and upset me in equal measure that Bangkok, and what I&#x2019;d seen of Thailand in general, seemed to be completely overstaffed. In any shop, even if you just went in for a packet of peanuts, there was always one person to guide you around, then another to work the till, and a third to bag your purchase. Labor was so cheap there, it was a joke. I immediately felt bad for thinking that, then reminded myself that this was why I loved traveling: it put things into perspective.<br> <br>The driver dropped me at the Grand Palace and I followed the hordes of tourists, many of them bearing telltale red shoulders that spoke of a recent arrival from colder climates. Outside the temple, I removed my hiking boots and placed them with the variety of flip-flops and trainers other visitors had left by the steps, then walked inside. The Emerald Buddha was supposed to be over five hundred years old and was the most famous statue in Thailand. Yet he was small compared to the many other Buddhas I&#x2019;d seen. The brightness of the jade and the way his body was shaped reminded me of a bright green lizard. His limbs were fluid and, to be honest, not very accurate. Not that it mattered&#x2014;&#x201c;he&#x201d; was a beautiful thing.<br> <br>I sat down cross-legged on one of the mats, enjoying my time out in the sun in this big, peaceful space with other human beings around me, probably contemplating their navels too. I&#x2019;d never been one for religion, but if I had to pick one, I liked Buddhism best because it seemed to be all about the power of nature, which I felt was a permanent miracle happening right in front of my eyes.<br> <br>Star often said that I should sign up to become a member of the Green Party when she&#x2019;d listen to me rant on for ages after watching some TV program on the environment, but what would be the point? My voice didn&#x2019;t count, and I was too stupid to be taken seriously. All I knew was that the plants, animals, and oceans that made up our ecosystem and sustained us were...</p><h2>Long Summer Day (A Horseman Riding By, Book 1)</h2><p>Paul Craddock is still young when he is invalided out of the army after the Boer War and he discovers the neglected estate of Shallowford in a secluded corner of Devon.

For more information about Joseph, please visit his website www.josephbruchac.com.Gr. 4^-7. Fourteen-year-old Samuel Russell hates being called a coward because he is a Quaker, and he vows to defend his family if Loyalists or Indians try to harm them. Stands Straight, an Abenaki boy whose mother and brother were murdered by white men, has joined his uncle's scouting party, though he questions why Indians should fight in the white man's war. In alternating narratives, the two boys tell this quietly compelling story, which is based on an actual incident that took place in 1777, just before the Battle of Saratoga. As Samuel's family sits in the meeting with the rest of the Quaker congregation, the Indian scouting party to which Stands Straight belongs surrounds the cabin. Stands Straight follows his uncle Sees-the-Wind inside, and after being assured that there are no weapons in the cabin, the Abenakis leave their bows and arrows outside and sit with the Quakers in silence. At the end of the meeting, the Quakers and the Indians share the handshake of peace, and Sees-the-Wind places an arrow over the cabin's door to show the Abenakis that the Quakers are people of peace. Simple black-and-white drawings reflect the dignified tone of the story, which explores the complexities of the Indian-white relationship, focusing on two lesser-known groups who were involved in the conflict. An author's note provides thorough historical background about the incident, as well as a brief history of the Quakers and the Abenakis. A truly excellent example of historical fiction for the middle-grade/junior-high audience. <i>Karen Hutt</i></p><h2>The 20th Century Art Book</h2><p>Depicts five hundred paintings and sculptures, each by a different modern artist, in alphabetical order by artist, with a brief description of the work and its place in art history and in the artist&#39;s career</p><p>One of the most complete representations of this century's art to hit the shelves in years, <b>The 20th-Century Art Book</b> offers 500 full-page reproductions, each by a different artist.

Henry H. Shelton, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to call him "an icon to what service in the armed forces is about." He retired from the army in 1992 as a command sergeant major, becoming a benefits counselor for the Veterans Administration. He passed away on June 30, 2000.The Special Operations Group (SOG), a small unit that operated behind enemy lines during the Vietnam War, has gotten remarkably little historical examination. This memoir by Congressional Medal of Honor-winner Miller describes some of the actions of this unusual unit. Miller was sent to Vietnam in 1966, and once he discovered he was very good at combat, managed to remain there until 1972 when his status as a recipient of the nation's highest military medal (and hence a soldier to be protected from further hazardous duty) forced him back to the States. His exploits are disturbingly and vividly told, with the frank language and gruesome detail that is common to descriptions of close combat; there is an especially harrowing description of the action that got him the Medal of Honor. For students of the war there are many glimpses into the workings of the SOG. The book's sanguine tone somewhat mars recommending this for general readers.<br><i>- Mel D.

Mother. Sister. Lived in our very own double-wide. Brown shag carpet. Dirty gold countertops. Peeling linoleum floors. Used to race my Hot Wheels down those food-splattered counter tops, double-loop through ramps of curling linoleum, then land in gritty piles of shag. Place was definitely a shit hole. But being a kid, I called it home.</i></p><p><i>Mornings, wolfing down Cheerios, watching Scooby-Doo without any volume so I wouldn&#x2019;t wake the &#x2019;rents. Getting my baby sister up, ready for school. Both of us staggering out the front door, backpacks nearly busting with books.</i></p><p><i>Important to read. Someone told me that. Mom, Dad, grandparent, teacher? Don&#x2019;t remember now, but somewhere I got the message. Book a day. Like an apple. So after school I headed off to the library, sister still in tow. Read some books, &#x2019;cause God knows we didn&#x2019;t have any fruit.</i></p><p><i>I liked Choose Your Own Adventures. Each scene had a cliffhanger ending, where you had to decide what would happen next. Turn left in the forbidden temple or turn right? Pick up the cursed treasure or walk on by? In the Choose Your Own Adventure books, you were always the one in control.</i></p><p><i>Then I&#x2019;d read </i>Clifford the Big Red Dog <i>to my little sis. Not old enough to read yet, she&#x2019;d point and laugh at the pictures.</i></p><p><i>Sometimes, the librarian would sneak us snacks. She&#x2019;d say stuff like, Someone left behind their bag of chips. Would you like them? I&#x2019;d say, Nah. She&#x2019;d say, Go on, better you than me. Potato chips aren&#x2019;t good for my girlish figure.</i></p><p><i>Eventually my sister would grab the chips, eyes greedy. She was always hungry back then. We both were.</i></p><p><i>After library, home.</i></p><p><i>Sooner or later, always had to go home.</i></p><p><i>My mom had this smile. When she was in the right mood, having a &#x201c;good day,&#x201d; oh, that smile. She&#x2019;d ruffle my hair. Call me her little man. Say how proud she was of me. And hug me. Big, strong hugs, envelopes of cigarette smoke and cheap perfume. I loved that smell. I loved the days my mother smiled.</i></p><p><i>Sometimes, if things were going really well, she&#x2019;d fix dinner. Spaghetti noodles with ketchup&#x2014;that&#x2019;ll leave a stain, she&#x2019;d cry gaily, slurping up noodles. Ramen noodles with scrambled eggs&#x2014;dinner for fifteen cents, now we&#x2019;re living the dream, she&#x2019;d declare. Or my favorite, Kraft macaroni and cheese&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the nuclear orange color that makes it special, she&#x2019;d whisper.</i></p><p><i>My little sister would giggle. She liked my mother in this mood. Who wouldn&#x2019;t?</i></p><p><i>Dad was usually at work. Bringing home the bacon. When he had a job. Gas station attendant. Night clerk. Warehouse stocker.</i></p><p><i>Stay in school, he&#x2019;d tell me, afternoons when we came home in time to watch him button up yet another grimy uniform. Fucking real world, he&#x2019;d tell me. Fucking bosses.</i></p><p><i>Then off he&#x2019;d go. And my mom would appear from the hazy cloud of their bedroom to start dinner. Or the door would never open, and I&#x2019;d get out a can opener instead. Chef Boyardee. Campbell&#x2019;s soup. Baked beans.</i></p><p><i>My sister and I didn&#x2019;t talk those nights. We ate in silence. Then I&#x2019;d read her more </i>Clifford, <i>or maybe we&#x2019;d play Go Fish. Quiet games for quiet kids. My sister would fall asleep on the sofa. Then I&#x2019;d pick her up, carry her off to bed.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say sleepily, though neither of us knew what she was apologizing for.</i></p><p><i>Had a family once. Father. Mother. Sister.</i></p><p><i>But then the father worked less and less and drank more and more. And the mother . . . Dunno. Drugs, booze, her own foggy mind? Parental units appeared less and less to cook, clean, work. More and more to fight, scream, yell. Mom, hurling plastic plates across the kitchen. Dad, punching a hole through the cheap drywall. Then both would guzzle more vodka and do the whole thing all over again.</i></p><p><i>Sister took to sleeping in my room, while I sat by the door. &#x2019;Cause sometimes, the parents had guests over. Other boozers, druggies, losers. Then all bets were off. Three, four, five in the morning. Locked doorknob rattling, strange voices crooning, &#x201c;Hey, little kids, come out and play with us. . . .&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>My sister didn&#x2019;t giggle anymore. She slept with the light on, ragged copy of </i>Clifford <i>clutched in her hands.</i></p><p><i>While I kept watch with a baseball bat balanced across my knees. Then, morning. House finally quiet. Strangers passed out on the floor. As we crept around them, stealing into the kitchen for the Cheerios box, then grabbing our backpacks and tiptoeing out the door.</i></p><p><i>Rinse, spin, repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Had a family once.</i></p><p><i>But then the father drank or shot up or snorted too much. And the mom&#x2014;envelopes of cigarette smoke and cheap perfume&#x2014;started to scream and scream and scream. While my sister and I watched wide-eyed from the sofa.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Shut up, shut up, shut up,&#x201d; the father yelled. Scream. Scream. Scream.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Fucking bitch! What&#x2019;s wrong with you?&#x201d; Scream. Scream. Scream.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I said, SHUT UP!&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Kitchen knife. Big one. Butcher knife, like from a slasher film. Did she grab it? Did he? Don&#x2019;t remember who had it first. Can only tell you who had it last.</i></p><p><i>My father. Raising the knife up. Bringing the knife down. Then my mother wasn&#x2019;t screaming anymore.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Shit!&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>My father, turning to my sister and me. Bloody knife, drip, drip, drip. And I knew then, what he&#x2019;d do next.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Run,&#x201d; I told my little sister as I dragged her off the sofa, shoved her toward the hall.</i></p><p><i>The shag carpet slowed him down. But the peeling linoleum tripped us up. As we raced through the double-wide, silent in our terror, I passed my sister, scooped her up, little legs still churning through the air.</i></p><p><i>I could hear him, right behind me. I could feel his breath on my neck, already picture the blade slicing between my bony shoulder blades. I threw my sister into my bedroom.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Lock the door!&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Then sprinting down the hall, my father and his bloody knife close behind.</i></p><p><i>I bolted into my parents&#x2019; bedroom. Leapt onto the bed. &#x201c;Fucking kid. Stay still, stay still, stay still.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Knife going up, knife going down. Shredding the bedding. Tearing into the mattress.</i></p><p><i>I jumped down the other side. Grabbed anything I could find from the top of the bureau. Empty wine bottles, beer cans, perfume. Hurled them into my father&#x2019;s beet-red face.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Shit shit shit.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Then, as he staggered, I jumped back over the bed, whirling around him. I heard the slash of the knife. Felt the burning pain in my shoulder. But then I was clear, hammering down the hall. If I could make it out the front door, into the yard, cry for the neighbors . . .</i></p><p><i>And leave my little sister behind?</i></p><p><i>Then she was there. Standing in my bedroom doorway. Holding out the baseball bat.</i></p><p><i>I didn&#x2019;t hesitate. I grabbed the wooden bat. I raced into the family room, turning at the last second, assuming the proper stance.</i></p><p><i>My father. Wild eyes. Flushed face. Lights on, I thought, but no one home.</i></p><p><i>He raised the bloody knife.</i></p><p><i>I swung with all my might. Felt the connection, a solid, wet smack, as I knocked it out of the park. My father, falling down, down, down, knife dropping into the carpet.</i></p><p><i>And still I swung the bat. Bam. Bam. Bam. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.</i></p><p><i>My little sister, suddenly appearing beside me. &#x201c;Telly, Telly, Telly.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Myself, looking up. Wild eyes. Flushed face.

Had a family.</i></p><p><i>Once.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sheriff Shelly Atkins wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be in the law enforcement business anymore. Ten years after a fire had left her torso and upper shoulder a ropey mess of scars, not to mention ruined her hip, she&#x2019;d hung up her hat, so to speak. Taking up an anonymous benefactor&#x2019;s offer of a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Paris (retired FBI agent Pierce Quincy, she remained certain), she&#x2019;d initially salved her</p><p>wounds with French crepes, French wine, and French museums.</p><p>Then she came home. Set herself up with a steady schedule of walking the beach, hiking the woods, keeping herself busy. Her replaced hip did best when in motion, the soreness of an active day far better than the knifing ache of idleness. And roaming the great outdoors, she was less likely to remember. A woman with her number of scars was definitely best off not remembering.</p><p>Then two years ago, the sitting county sheriff, an outsider whom the locals had never quite taken to, had resigned abruptly. Some whispers of impropriety, but nothing the DA could prove. Either way, the county found itself sheriff-less. And Shelly . . .</p><p>She wasn&#x2019;t a beautiful woman. Not even pretty, and that was before the fire had turned half her body into a Picasso painting. She had the solid build of a plow horse and the kind of no-nonsense face that invited men to talk to her at bars while still eyeing the prettier girl three seats down.</p><p>She had no family, no children, not even a pet goldfish, because she was never entirely certain she wouldn&#x2019;t take off again.</p><p>Basically, eight years after the fire had nearly killed her, Shelly had managed to add nothing and no one to her life. Mostly, she missed her job like hell. Not to mention the people she&#x2019;d once worked with.</p><p>So she&#x2019;d run for sheriff. And given that she was still remembered as something of a hometown hero for saving a federal agent from that fire, the locals had enthusiastically voted her back into office, bum hip, scarred torso, and all.</p><p>Which meant, Shelly reminded herself now as she drove, lights flashing, that she had only herself to blame. A report of shots fired this time of year? Not good for the local sheriff, nor the business leaders who counted on the quaint coastal town&#x2019;s sleepy reputation to remain, well, sleepy.</p><p>Hour was still early, just after eight, which argued for either cranky good old boys who were still half-skunked from their excesses the night before, or disillusioned tourists who&#x2019;d finally figured out that camping in a heat wave wasn&#x2019;t all it was cracked up to be. Normally, August in these parts wasn&#x2019;t so bad, especially with the ocean breeze helping keep temperatures reasonable. But the mercury had been topping a hundred for the past five days and bringing tempers with it.</p><p>In a rural community of five thousand, where the number of guns probably did outnumber the total population, maybe a report of shots fired had been only a matter of time. Dispatch had provided the address, a gas station/convenience store at the edge of town, and Shelly had personally taken charge. Both her deputies had already logged overtime working the normal summertime nuisance calls, so she felt it was the least she could do. And while she wasn&#x2019;t happy about gunshots in her town, she wasn&#x2019;t terribly concerned. Overall, Bakersville, Oregon, was most famous for its cheese, trees, and ocean breeze. Sure, it also had a growing meth problem, but policing in these parts was hardly big-city stress.</p><p>Headed north, having already made it through the blink-or-you&#x2019;ll-miss-it downtown, Shelly was approaching the county&#x2019;s biggest claim to fame: the cheese factory. Even with lights flashing, she had to blare her horn to weave her way through the thick line of RVs and campers already stacked up, waiting to turn into the parking lot. Given the already hotter-than-hell morning, most of the tourists were probably planning on ice cream for breakfast. When she completed this call, Shelly might join them. Community policing. Eat ice cream, mingle with locals. Sounded like a plan to her.</p><p>North of the factory, traffic died down and Shelly picked up speed. Road was narrower here, winding through sharp bends as it twisted its way along the rocky coast. Then, five miles after a turn-in for yet another campground, Shelly arrived at her location: the EZ Gas.</p><p>Shelly swung in, killing the lights while appraising the scene. She saw one truck parked in front of the twin gas pumps, a battered Ford that had seen better days. Otherwise the place appeared quiet. Shelly got on her radio, alerted dispatch that she&#x2019;d arrived. Then, picking up her broad-brimmed hat from the seat beside her, she placed it on her head and climbed out of her white sheriff&#x2019;s SUV.</p><p>First thing that struck her: the absence of sound. That, much as anything, set her nerves on edge. In a hot hazy August, when the local businesses were as busy as they were gonna get, the quiet here . . . It wasn&#x2019;t a good kind of quiet. Shelly&#x2019;s hand went to her holster. She automatically shifted her stance sideways, making herself less of a target, as she approached the front of the worn-looking convenience store.</p><p>Smell hit her next. Coppery, thick. An odor even a small-town sheriff knew better than she would&#x2019;ve liked.</p><p>The faded red pickup, midnineties, was to her left, the open glass door to the small convenience store to her right. Shelly paused, considering. Vehicle appeared unoccupied, which left the store as the main area of concern. She moved closer to the exterior wall, bottom half blocked by giant coolers of ice, upper windows plastered with various posters advertising cheap beer. Hand still on her holster, she tucked herself beside the ice coolers and peered through the open door.</p><p>Nothing to see. And again, nothing to hear. Not the ring of the cash register. Not the murmur of voices as the clerk rang up the sale from the truck owner. Just that smell. Thick and pungent in sweltering August heat.</p><p>Then, a sound did reach her ears: soft, steady. The drone of flies. Lots and lots of flies.</p><p>Shelly knew then what she&#x2019;d be finding inside.</p></p><h2>Inside the Aquarium: Making of a Top Soviet Spy</h2><p>Describes the author&#39;s recruitment and training inside the Aquarium, headquarters of the GRU, the Soviet Union&#39;s top-secret military intelligence organization</p><p>Text: EnglishAnother revelation from this well- known Soviet defector (author of In side the Soviet Army and Inside Soviet Intelligence) , this time on Soviet mili tary intelligence, the GRU ("Aquari um" is its headquarters).

In his engaging memoir <i>Street Smarts</i>, Rogers offers pithy commentary from a lifetime of adventure, from his early years growing up a na�ve kid in Demopolis, Alabama, to his fledgling career on Wall Street, to his cofounding of the wildly successful Quantum Fund.<br><br>In <i>Street Smarts</i>, Rogers takes us through the highlights of his life in the financial markets, from his school days at Yale and Oxford--where despite the fact that he didn&#x2019;t have enough money to afford the appropriate pair of shoes, he coxed the crew and helped to win the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race as well as the Thames Cup, the first of his three Guiness World Records--to his first heady taste of Wall Street in the mid-1960s, and his years helping to run the most successful hedge fund on Wall Street.</p><p>In the course of his new book, Rogers offers often surprising observations on how the world works&#x2013;-and what trends he sees in the future. The age of Wall Street, Rogers claims, when the finance industry drove 25% of America&#x2019;s growth, is over. Tomorrow&#x2019;s economy will be driven by those who make things--food, energy, goods and consumables. He explains why Asia will be the dominant economic force in the twenty-first century, and discusses why America and the European Union are in decline, and what we need to do to right our economy and society.</p></p><p><p>JIM ROGERS&nbsp;cofounded the Quantum Fund and retired at age thirty-seven.&nbsp; Since then he has served as a sometime professor of finance at Columbia University&#x2019;s business school, and as a media commentator worldwide.&nbsp; In 2007, he moved his family to Singapore in the belief that the 21st century will be the century of Asia.&nbsp; Rogers is the author of the bestsellers <i>Investment Biker</i>, <i>Adventure Capitalist</i>, <i>Hot Commodities</i>, <i>A Gift to My Children</i>, and <i>A Bull in China</i>.</p>chapter 1<br><br>Portrait of the Investor as a Young Man<br><br>My hometown, Demopolis, sits in the heart of the Alabama Canebrake, where the Black Warrior and the Tombigbee Rivers meet. The largest city in Marengo County, it lies in the center of a region of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi known historically as the Black Belt, so named for the layer of naturally rich, thick black prairie soil that almost two hundred years ago nourished the growth of vast cotton plantations, some of which outlasted slavery, none of which survived the boll weevil.<br><br>It was in that soil, when I was a boy, that my friends and I would dig for bait before setting off to spend the day fishing. Channel catfish are omnivorous and will strike at just about anything they can smell&#x2014;�they are able to smell just about everything&#x2014;�and earthworms, on a hot summer day, are a lot easier to gather than crickets. I must have been eight years old and we were digging in the backyard of my house when my cousin Wade, who was about ten months older than I, ventured a remark that, while entirely incomprehensible at the time, remains vivid to me to this day.<br><br>&#x201c;If we keep digging,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ll end up in China.&#x201d;<br><br>I was not ignorant of the fact that the world was round, but not until I was able to consult a globe&#x2014;�I was an enthusiastic researcher even then&#x2014;�did I come to appreciate that directly opposite Alabama, on the other side of the planet, sprawled the vast landmass of the People&#x2019;s Republic, where covered in dirt and drenched with sweat I would eventually emerge if I were energetic enough to keep digging.<br><br>Decades have intervened since then, and I have followed a more circuitous route, but on the very doorstep of China is where I find myself living today, the father of two little blue-�eyed blondes who speak Mandarin as fluently as they speak English.<br><br>How I came to be a permanent resident of Singapore is a story about digging of a different kind, excavation perhaps less arduous, though no less energetic. It is a result of my endless effort to experience firsthand the inner workings of the world, to get out and unearth the real story, to explore it all for myself.<br><br>I have circumnavigated the globe twice now, once by motorcycle, once by car, investigating the world at ground level, charting the shifting circumstances of more than a hundred nations in the course of those five years. For me, understanding history and its consequences has not been an armchair endeavor, but a hands-�on adventure. It has led to great personal and material rewards, and it inevitably led me here, far from the backwoods of Alabama, to this largely Chinese outpost on the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula.<br><br>If history affirms anything, it is the proposition put forth by the Greeks that &#x201c;nothing endures but change.&#x201d; It originated with the philosopher Heraclitus in the sixth century B.C., when he informed us aphoristically that it is not possible to step twice into the same river. Success in life is measured by the ability to anticipate change, and I came to Singapore in response to the realization that the world is in the midst of a historic shift, a dramatic reshaping of the terrain, a decline of US leadership in the world and a commensurate rise in Asia.<br><br>I write this in the midst of a global financial crisis that most of the world&#x2019;s politicians would have you believe is temporary. Things, we are told, will turn around. I will not argue with that. I am here to tell you, simply, that things are unlikely to turn around permanently in your lifetime. The staggering debt loads in many countries will lead to major changes in the way we all live and work. Many old institutions, traditions, political parties, governments, cultures, even nations will decline or collapse or simply disappear, just as has always happened in times of political and economic turmoil.<br><br>The investment bank Bear Stearns, for instance, was decades old when it went under in 2008. The financial-�services firm Lehman Brothers, when it foundered that same year, had been in business for more than a century and a half. The cave-�in of those long-�established, global corporations exemplifies the changing circumstances faced by many American institutions. Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford, though they might not know it yet, may be heading toward bankruptcy. Museums, hospitals, and other institutions we know and love are headed for trouble, and we are going to see a lot of them vanish in the upheaval, be it financial or economic.<br><br>Some have labeled me an alarmist, a modern-�day Cassandra. But nothing I see in the future need serve as cause for alarm, or even come as a surprise. The winds of change are blowing, they are blowing from the direction of China, and they are blowing in predictable fashion. What we are witnessing is business as usual, history turning a familiar page. And throughout history such moments of transition have presented opportunities to the attentive, so I am wildly optimistic about many things to come.<br><br>If you were smart at the start of the nineteenth century, you made your way to London. If you were smart at the start of the twentieth, you packed up and moved to New York. If you are smart at the start of the twenty-�first, you will find your way to Asia. A hundred years from now, the cycle of change could lead anywhere&#x2014;�at the end of the first millennium, all the smart people moved to C�rdoba, the flower of Islamic Spain, at the time the intellectual center of Europe and the most populous city in the world.<br><br>I moved to Asia in 2007, and even more significantly, I moved my children here. In their lifetime, a knowledge of Asia will be indispensable to success, and a mastery of Mandarin will prove, throughout the world, as important as the mastery of English does today. Power and influence in the world moved from Great Britain to the United States in the 1920s and 1930s. The loss of British leadership was exacerbated by a financial crisis and political mismanagement, and it was unnoticed by many until twenty or thirty years later. Power and influence are now moving from the United States to Asia, a loss of American leadership accelerated by the same forces, and a change that likewise remains unnoticed by most.<br><br>The transition to Asia comes at a time of a second historical shift. In the depths of a financial meltdown, the world is on the verge of a transition away from finance itself, a cyclical shift away from financial firms as a source of prosperity. Throughout history there have been periods where financiers were in charge, and there have been periods where the producers of real goods&#x2014;�farmers, miners, energy providers, lumberjacks&#x2014;�were in charge. In the &#x2019;50s, &#x2019;60s, and &#x2019;70s, before the big bull market, Wall Street and the City of London were backwaters. They will be again. The money shufflers are in decline, and those identified in the Book of Joshua as the &#x201c;hewers of wood and drawers of water&#x201d; will now inherit the earth.<br><br>Examining the forces of history responsible for the changes in question, embracing the simple hypothesis that nothing goes on forever, I have come to appreciate the observation of another of civilization&#x2019;s great thinkers, Albert Einstein, who said: &#x201c;Only two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity. And I&#x2019;m not so sure about the former.&#x201d;<br><br>Let us not forget that Cassandra, the Trojan princess who made a nuisance of herself when she warned against dragging the Greeks&#x2019; wooden horse into the city, if remembered for no other attribute, is remembered for having been right.<br><br>My aim in writing this book, among other things, is to cast light on how we came to be where we are and how individuals can go about educating themselves to prepare for the future. In doing so, I will share with you insights gained over the course of a lifetime in finance, investing, and the pursuit of adventure, lessons I learned growing up, following a road that led from the soil of the Black Belt to this Southeast Asian city-�state on the other side of the globe, a lifelong journey in the course of which I made the whole world my backyard.<br><br>My adventure in the markets began in the spring of 1964. I was a senior at Yale, and I found myself headed to Wall Street in much the same way that I had earlier found myself headed to the Ivy League: I stumbled into it.<br><br>In high school, I was an enthusiastic member of the Key Club, a student-�led service organization, part of Kiwanis International, which until 1976 was restricted to boys. Membership in the Demopolis Key Club was something of a big deal because the local sponsor had made the decision to admit only five boys a year. The year I served as president, the Demopolis club won the award as the world&#x2019;s best Key Club from a small town. Every year, back then, Yale University granted a four-�year scholarship to a member of Key Club International. The scholarship was how I heard of Yale. Had it not been for the Key Club I never would have applied.<br><br>The school I fully expected to attend, the only college other than Yale to which I applied, was the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, a liberal arts college affiliated with the Episcopal Church. I was accepted at Sewanee shortly after sending in my application. It was not until April or May, some considerable time after my father sent Sewanee the required $50 acceptance fee, that I received a thick envelope from Yale containing notification that I had been accepted there and had been awarded the Key Club scholarship of $2,000 a year.<br><br>I was astonished.<br><br>I was seventeen and knew little about Yale except that it was in New Haven, Connecticut. My parents, however, were experienced enough to appreciate the significance of my being accepted. Both were college graduates. They had met at the University of Oklahoma, where both were Phi Beta Kappa. My father had studied petroleum engineering, my mother liberal arts. To them, my attending Yale was pretty big stuff. &#x201c;We are a little bit worried to have you setting off to that bastion of liberalism in the North,&#x201d; I remember my father saying, but in fact both he and my mother were ecstatic. My father&#x2019;s joy would be tempered somewhat by his subsequent failure to get back the $50 he had sent to Sewanee. Fifty dollars in 1960 in Demopolis was a lot of money, and is still a lot of money today, but back then it was worth about seven times as much as it is worth currently.<br><br>I was the eldest of five brothers and one of fewer than fifty students in my high school class, and I was quick to exhibit to all of them the exaggerated sense of my own importance that flowed from my good fortune. I immediately started putting on the big dog, as we say in those parts, but my inflated sense of myself was destined to be short-�lived. Slowly it dawned on me, Oh, oh, now I have to go to Yale. And I was suddenly scared, because I knew I was in way over my head. I wondered, What am I going to do now?<br><br>That summer, traveling to attend the Key Club convention in Boston, I got off the train in New Haven and went to the Yale admissions office. I wanted to know why I had been accepted. I hoped that by asking that question, I might get an idea of what to expect and understand what might be expected of me. The admissions director pulled out my folder and said, &#x201c;What do you mean? Look, you graduated first in your class. You got a hundred in many of your subjects. Your average was almost a hundred.&#x201d;<br><br>Yeah, but that was in Demopolis. Oh, my gosh, I thought, these guys think I&#x2019;m smart, they think I know something.<br><br>Feeling totally unprepared to compete with students from prestigious northeastern prep schools, I arrived at Yale ready to study that much harder than everyone else. A test came up, I remember, and one of my classmates said that he was going to study five hours to prepare for it. &#x201c;This test,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is worth five hours of study.&#x201d; I found his reasoning very peculiar. My approach was to study as much as was necessary until I knew the subject, and then study some more just to be sure. It was the approach I took to everything, a discipline my brothers and I picked up from my parents: There is no such thing as enough. You just keep studying, or keep working, or keep researching, whatever the task happens to be.<br><br>Today, I wish I knew how to instill this characteristic in my children. I wish I could call my father or mother and say, &#x201c;What pill did you give us?&#x201d; Call it discipline, call it diligence, call it work ethic&#x2014;�we all have it, my brothers and I. I do not know where it comes from. I wish I could find the gene. I am certainly not alone in recognizing the value of persistence&#x2014;we all know smart people who are not successful; we all know talented people who are not successful. Persistence is what makes the difference.<br><br>The cost of tuition and room and board at Yale back then was $2,300. With my $2,000 scholarship I was $300 short to start with, and that was before the cost of books and other routine expenses. I got a job as a busboy in the dining hall a few hours a week and continued taking part-�time jobs at the university all the time I was there.<br><br>Work experience in one&#x2019;s youth offers quantifiable benefits. While teaching the value of money, it also helps you develop an identity; in learning to manage finances, you gain a tangible measure of autonomy. I started paying my own way early in life, well before arriving at Yale. My father, when I was six, teaching me that &#x201c;money does not grow on trees,&#x201d; insisted that I pay for my own baseball glove. I went down to Braswell Hardware in Demopolis and picked out a glove that cost four dollars. I took it home, and every Saturday I returned to pay the proprietor, Cruse Braswell, fifteen cents until the full price had been paid. Years later, a Columbia business school dean, citing a university study, told me that the single most important predictor of a happy life in adulthood was having a paying job as a teenager.<br><br>All in all, I had a fine time at Yale. I majored in history and competed as a coxswain on the crew, lettering in my sophomore and junior years (I did not cox as a senior). I even did a little acting and landed a couple of leading roles. One was directed by John Badham, class of 1961. Can you imagine what a hit his movie �Saturday Night Fever would have been if he had remembered me for the lead! But as much as I loved it, I never went too far with it, for the same reason that I did not cox as a senior. I devoted the time to my studies instead. And the discipline paid off. Not as smart as everybody else, I managed to graduate cum laude.</p><h2>1001 Winning Chess Sacrifices and Combinations</h2><p>Book by Reinfeld, Fred</p><p></p><h2>Lives of the Musicians: Good Times, Bad Times (and What the Neighbors Thought)</h2><p>It's no secret that Beethoven went deaf, that Mozart had constant money problems, and that Gilbert and Sullivan wrote musicals.

Johnny Bible killed to steal his namesake's glory. Oilman Allan Mitchelson died for his principles. And convict Lenny Spaven died just to prove a point. "Bible John" terrorized Glasgow in the sixties and seventies, murdering three women he met in a local ballroom--and he was never caught. Now a copycat is at work. Nicknamed "Bible Johnny" by the media, he is a new menace with violent ambitions. </p><p>The Bible Johnny case would be perfect for Inspector John Rebus, but after a run-in with a crooked senior officer, he's been shunted aside to one of Edinburgh's toughest suburbs, where he investigates the murder of an off-duty oilman.

Suddenly caught in the glare of the television cameras and in the middle of more than one investigation, Rebus must proceed with caution: One mistake could mean an unpleasant and not particularly speedy death, or, worse still, losing his job. </p><p>Written with Ian Rankin's signature wit, style and intricacy, <i>Black and Blue</i> is a novel of uncommon and unforgettable intrigue.</p></p><p>"I'm a peeper, he thought, a voyeur. All cops are. But he knew he was more than that: he liked to get involved in the lives around him. He had a need to know which went beyond voyeurism. It was a drug. And the thing was, when he had all this knowledge, he then had to use booze to blank it out..." In his ninth outing, Edinburgh's glowering and tenacious Inspector John Rebus finds a unique way of cutting back on alcohol. Convinced that Rebus might lie or try to destroy evidence in the reopened case of a man convicted of a murder he probably didn't commit, the investigating officer assigns him a babysitter. Luckily, the minder is one of Rebus's old mentors, Jack Morton, a former drinking buddy now waging a successful battle against the bottle. Rebus and Morton burn off energy and anger repainting Rebus's apartment, while trying to clear Rebus's name and exploring the connection between a recent string of murders and a real-life Scottish serial killer of the 1970s known as Bible John. The cases take Rebus to Aberdeen and an oil platform in the North Atlantic, but as usual the main action happens within the mind and soul of Rankin's meticulously crafted creation.

Through a careful reconstruction of events, first-person accounts, period illustrations, and maps, and by providing information on the exact locations of more than fifty battles, <em>King Philip's War</em> is useful as well as informative. Students of history, colonial war buffs, those interested in Native American history, and anyone who is curious about how this war affected a particular New England town, will find important insights into one of the most seminal events to shape the American mind and continent.</p><p>Now largely forgotten, the massacres of 1675 to 1676, known as King Philip's War, ended the harmonious relations that had existed between native Americans and the colonists since their arrival at Plymouth Rock in 1620. Tensions had been rising as the number of settlers grew, and the pillaging of an outlying farm by affronted young braves escalated into open hostilities. Pitched battles were fought from Rhode Island to Maine. Hundreds of English died as farmers fled and cowered behind stockades or in the few port towns. Thousands of natives were slaughtered and the rest dispersed or sold into slavery in the West Indies. The savagery resulted in the clearing of the native populations from southern New England and the unopposed expansion of the New England colonies. It also became the brutal model on which the United States came to deal with its native peoples. <i>King Philip's War</i> tells the story with such close attention to detail that each ambush, each burned-out farm, becomes a vivid image. The authors make abundant use of maps and photographs of old sites to enable the reader to follow the course of the war: the book forms an exhaustive guide for the armchair historian or anyone wishing to visit the monuments and battlefields today. The terror and bitterness of the period live again in the book's illustrations of old woodcuts and lithographs and in quotations from contemporary narratives. That King Philip, whose head was paraded around the streets of Plymouth in a barbarous show of triumph, was the son of the Wampanoag chief who celebrated the first Thanksgiving with the Pilgrims in 1621 adds to the irony and tragedy of the events, whose memory this well-researched book deservedly keeps alive. <i>--John Stevenson</i><b>Eric B.

His style ranged from the social realism of his WPA murals through his abstract expressionist canvasses of the 1950s and 1960s (when he counted Pollock, Rothko, de Kooning, and Kline among his friends) to his cartoonlike paintings of Klansmen, disembodied heads, and tangled piles of everyday objects. Critics and public alike savaged Guston for his return to figurative art, but today his late work is recognized for the singular power of its darkly hilarious vision. Musa Mayer augments her firsthand knowledge with extensive interviews with his family, friends, students, and colleagues, as well as Guston's own letters, notes, and autobiographical writings, to re-create a turbulent era in American art. <i>Night Studio</i>, profusely illustrated (including almost a dozen paintings in full color), illuminates not only the life of a great artist, but the experience of growing up in his shadow.</p><p><b>Musa Mayer</b> is the author of <i>Examining Myself: One Woman's Story of Breast Cancer Treatment and Recovery.</i> She lives in New York City.</p><h2>Bartlett&#39;s Familiar Quotations - Revised and Enlarged Fifteenth and 125th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>A Collection of Passages, Phrases and Proverbs Traced to Their Sources in Ancient and Modern Literature</p><p></p><h2>Learning to Be White: Money, Race and God in America</h2><p><p>Thandeka explores the politics of the white experience in America.

The first beaver she spotted at the lily-covered pond in Harriman State Park (N.Y.) was a huge male who appeared every evening to inspect the 150-foot dam; he was followed by a female and two kits. Ryden observed the family for four years, recording their activities and noting births, deaths, departures and a major move. Inevitably, she became involved with the animals--bringing food during a severe winter, helping the beavers save the dam when a vandal destroyed it, hand-feeding the feeble old matriarch in her final days. Ryden, who found beavers to be intensely social and highly intelligent, discusses the animals' importance in the ecosystem as they leave one pond and build another dam elsewhere. This is captivating natural history. Illustrations not seen by PW. First serial to Readers Digest; BOMC and QPB alternates. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.This is a diary of observations by naturalist/writer Ryden. This type of coverage can be interesting and enlightening, but Ryden is trying to pass it off as research. For example: Because there was no evidence of aspen by the pond, she assumes (wrongly) that these beavers have never tasted it, while beavers, in fact, do move beyond their home sites. Ryden is not satisfied to observe; she interferes, particularly when she feeds the beavers when she assumes that they need her help. Although this book's style may be entertaining to some, Better information can be obtained from wildlife magazines. Not recommended.

All the planets are traveling at different speeds around the Sun, and it takes more than twenty-five thousand years for all of them to line up the same way twice. Consequently, in terms of the astrology chart, each individual is totally unique. Astrology is not a study of general truth but rather a key to specific knowledge that can unlock the power of one's inner self. </p><p> A common denominator of all astrologers is the use of the basic mathematical tools of the planets, signs, and houses. There are as many different approaches to interpreting the astrology chart as there are astrologers. This is because each of us is unique, and the astrologer brings the dimension of himself or herself to the science and to the interpretation of the basic symbols. The meaning of the birthchart is filtered through the biases and basic outlook on life of the astrologer who is interpreting. For this reason the validation of your inner self is the ultimate judge of the accuracy and completeness of the insights offered you, as is the case with psychiatry, psychology, and any of the other social science approaches dealing with the uniqueness of a human being. </p><p> Different astrologers see different things when they look at a birthchart. Consequently, I wish to share some basic premises I hold about life as a whole, my biases, so that you will know consciously the filter through which this information is being presented. I also want to share my goals in coauthoring this book and the practical benefit that I feel it can be to the reader. </p><p> Many people believe that everything in astrology is predestined, that free will is precluded. In fact, quite the opposite is true. The astrology chart is simply a picture of the inner person just as the physical body is a picture of the outer person. </p><p> Without boundaries there is no free will or choice; there is nothing to choose between. In that sense your astrology chart, which shows a picture of your inner self, is set/predestined in the same way that your body is set/predestined at the moment of your birth. Your physical body, though it grows and matures, remains essentially the same. It is still your body, unique from others on Earth and the only body you have. In the same way, the astrology chart pictures your intangible body. It is a picture of your inner being, unique from everyone else on Earth and the only inner being that you have. The tangible aspects of a person, the body, can be seen physically. The intangible aspects of a person, the being within the body, can be seen mathematically through the astrology chart. </p><p> It is how we <i>use</i> what we have that the area of free will, or choice, enters in. Physically, we are aware of choice. We know what actions lead inevitably to pain, and if we do not want pain, we do not do those actions. On the intangible level the guideposts are just as inevitable, yet not as obvious except through mathematical tools that can display the energies graphically, such as astrology. </p><p> For example, if you were to start your automobile, "rev it up" to forty miles per hour, and drive into a brick wall, you know that would inevitably lead to pain. There is no way of getting around it, pain would be an unavoidable consequence of taking that action. </p><p> On the other hand, on the intangible level, each of us is continually putting into motion factors that inevitably lead to experiencing pain emotionally, mentally, and/or psychically. The only difference is that we are not as aware of the connection between cause and consequence when it is not on the strictly physical level. Astrology is a means of becoming aware of that connection on the intangible levels of experiencing oneself. Psychologically, we are doing things just as foolish as driving a car into a brick wall and then wondering, What went wrong? Why isn't life supporting me? I use astrology as a means for objectively getting in touch with brick walls for myself and others. </p><p> I'd like to share with you what I'm actually "up to" with astrology. I'm interested in experiencing happiness while on planet Earth, so for me astrology is a tool, not an end in itself. </p><p> The first thing I notice about personal happiness is that most of the people on this planet don't believe in it. Most of us are operating (consciously or unconsciously) out of a belief structure that says life is about suffering. We therefore go along with major compromises in our lives: we give away bits and pieces of ourselves; we stay in self-destructive situations; we give up our heart's dreams until one day we cash in all our chips and out we go. I have no retention of being on this planet (or any other) if I'm not going to enjoy myself and feel all the love of the universe flowing through mc in a way that works for me and for everyone around me. The challenge is creating personal happiness on a planet that doesn't believe in it. </p><p> In order to do this realistically, the first thing we need to do is get in touch with the laws of happiness operating here and begin to cooperate with them rather than resist them. The most important thing to notice about happiness is that all the joy we have ever experienced on this planet has been felt in one place and one place only: inside our own hearts. That's where we have experienced happiness, and that's where the source of it is. Personal happiness is a by-product of the times when our minds are centered inside the heart. When the mind is inside the heart, it's happy because it's home. </p><p> There are certain materialistic experiences, common to most of us, that can temporarily produce that state of happiness. One of these experiences is falling in love. If you have never fallen in love, the experience of infatuation is an effective facsimile. Before you fall in love your mind runs around telling you, "If only I get <i>this,</i> then I'll be happy"; "If only I get <i>that,</i> then I'll be happy"; "If only that person will go along with me, <i>then</i> I'll be happy." And the time comes when you fall in love. Well, since the mind is not programmed to handle love, as soon as you feel it, it "pops" the mind from its attachment to the world back into the heart center (where it is naturally attached), and for a while you're happy because for a while you're "home." </p><p> And it feels <i>great</i> when you're in love. There is a feeling that everything is "right," regardless of what seems to be happening in the external environment. When shopping at the supermarket, if somebody bumps into your cart, you don't mind. You just flow with it. If you happen to pass people arguing with each other, you still feel love. You may stop to help, but you don't stop feeling the joy inside yourself to do it. And you don't become less effective. You still work and play and wash your hair, and do all the things you normally do, but everything has a feeling of <i>magic</i> about it, a feeling of joy. </p><p> <i>This is your birthright.</i> Living in this state of consciousness is how it's supposed to be for all of us, all the time. It's natural. </p><p> Now we all know that the happiness you experienced when you were in love had nothing to do with the other person because if the other person stays around long enough, the mind goes out and tries to <i>change</i> the other person. The moment it does that, it leaves the heart center, and the restlessness, the sense that something is "missing," comes back. </p><p> There are other materialistic experiences that can temporarily produce happiness. Reaching a goal is a good example. Let's say you want to make a million dollars. It's easy to reach goals here -- you simply put all your life energy into it to the exclusion of everything else, and sooner or later you'll get there. So one day you wake up, look at your checkbook, and it says "plus one million dollars." Well, the mind is not programmed to handle success (like love, the feeling of success is spiritual), so as soon as the goal is reached, it pops the mind from its attachment to the world, and back the mind flies into the heart center. </p><p> And for a while you are happy. That happiness lasts until the mind becomes restless and begins to say, "Well, if a million made us <i>this</i> happy, think how happy <i>two</i> million will make us. Probably <i>twice</i> as happy!" And out the mind goes into the world to make that second million. When it does that, it leaves the heart center, and the unhappiness comes back, the incompleteness, the feeling that "something has to happen" in order for you to be happy again. </p><p> Other things can temporarily produce happiness, such as a moment of beauty in nature. Seeing someone do something nice for someone else, with no motive for personal gain, can produce joy as the mind tiles back into the heart again. But then you walk a little farther down the street and see a neighbor kicking a dog, and the mind goes out to make a judgment. The moment it does that, it leaves the heart center, and the unhappiness, the vague dissatisfaction, returns. </p><p> So obtaining personal happiness has to do with getting the mind to go into the heart center and remain there. Then we can do whatever we like -- experience romantic love, make lots of money, do all the things that are happy and fun. But everything is approached from a feeling of lightness, of "play," because we already have what we need: that feeling of internal happiness. </p><p> Two basic approaches can bring this state of consciousness about on a permanent basis. One is some form of meditation. Meditation works because on a daily basis it takes the mind away from its habit of attachment to the world, turns it inward to the heart, and gently says: "Here's where the happiness is; it's <i>inside,</i> not outside." And little by little the mind, which is a slow learner, begins to get the idea. With <i>proper</i> meditation, the power of contacting reality within yourself for even twenty minutes a day can grow so strong that you can spend the remaining twenty three hours and forty minutes of the day out in the world without losing the feeling of assurance and inner joy. </p><p> In the second approach to claiming personal happiness on a permanent basis (and there's no reason not to use both approaches simultaneously), we have to ask ourselves: Why does the mind go outward to begin with? When you were in love, why did the mind go out and try to change the other person? When you reached a goal, why did the mind go out and immediately try to reach another one? When you had a high meditation and felt joyous, why could somebody "push your buttons" and send you out again? This has to do with basic imbalances reside the mind itself that are karmic, stemming from past life patternings and tendencies. </p><p> Astrology is the fastest, most precise technique I know for getting in touch with those imbalances on an individual basis and making the corrections. That's why I use astrology. </p><p> Because each of us is so totally unique, an individual astrological reading is required in order to see the overall pattern in your life, (stemming from past lives) that is seeking to be corrected so bliss can be obtained permanently. Knowledge of the pattern is obtained through a synthesis of the factors that need purification in each of your planets, signs, and houses. As each of these factors is purified individually, your entire inner structure becomes harmonized and resolved. </p><p> It is for this reason that I have divided each of the planets into the "static" and "dynamic" categories as they travel through each of the signs. The "static" category is a picture of past life tendencies, habitual karmic responses that result in personal defeat and isolation from inner joy. The "dynamic" category suggests the purification process that can provide the antidote for the specific past life self-defeating tendency. </p><p> It's an experiment. As you begin actively practicing in your daily life one or more of the approaches outlined in the "dynamic" category (with the appropriate planet and sign placement in your individual birthchart), you will find yourself less affected by environmental stimuli throwing you off the center of inner joy. </p><p> I do not view your astrology chart as an accident. The moment of your birth, which is what your chart is based on, is perfect and very carefully <i>chosen</i> on the spiritual level of your own soul. Our soul chose its moment for manifestation, how it wanted things to be, only we forgot and lost the authority of our own energies. The curtain dropped, and we forgot that we chose it all. In this way the birthchart is a means of getting back in touch with the way we wanted it to be, our life or soul's direction. The astrology chart defines precisely the path we need to follow in order to fulfill personal potential and gain the satisfaction of self-completion. It is, in terms of individual completeness, the map back home. </p><p> When I look at an astrology chart, what I see is the soul's direction, the specific direction that one's life wants to go. Your life is going in the direction it's going whether you or I approve of it or not. When you are cooperating with your own direction of energy, everything on the physical plane works (love, sex, money, friendship, business, and so forth). When you are resisting the natural flow of your own energy, everything on the physical plane stops working in those areas where resistance is occurring. The idea is to have it all on a physical level by aligning and cooperating with the direction of one's own internal energies. </p><p> The purpose of this book is simply exposure -- to show the choices for action in planets located in specific signs. It is then possible to exercise free will within the framework of what is going on. This book addresses the specific challenge of each of the planets in each of the signs. Essentially, it says: "If you do this...you experience these things..." (that is, happiness); on the other hand, "If you do this...you experience..." (that is, unhappiness). </p><p> The astrology chart is a means for <i>objectively viewing</i> the intangible (nonphysical) dimension of oneself. When the intangible aspects of oneself are seen in a tangible way, it is at last possible to create realistically the unique conditions that will lead to individual satisfaction and happiness in life. To attempt to deal with the nonphysical aspects of oneself without scientifically knowing the dimensions and form of that self is to seek satisfaction from life on the levels of blind belief, happenstance, and superstition. It is neither scientific nor realistic and thus does not produce results that are consistently satisfying. </p><p> The astrology chart shows the inner person and where the individual needs to manifest potential outwardly in order to experience satisfaction inwardly. We all want to be happy, yet there are no magic rules that lead to happiness for everyone. For example, a person whose Moon is in Cancer can find emotional security through establishing a deep, intimate connection with another; a person whose Moon is in Libra finds emotional security through establishing a sense of harmonious cooperation in relationships.

Rose (Ugly As Sin), who was editor of St. Catherine Review for seven years, is the author of numerous articles, essays, and books that question the wisdom of contemporary liberal Catholicism. Here, he discusses the causes of the chronic priest shortage, including the misuse of psychological screening and what appears to be blatant discrimination against the kind of young men who were once considered ideal candidates for the vocation. He gives a disturbing glimpse behind the scenes that may go far in explaining the church's present difficulties. Based primarily on interviews, the book is carefully footnoted and contains a bibliography of sources cited and consulted. Highly recommended for anyone interested in this prominent topic, and for public and academic libraries. C.

But the refugees were starting to creep her out.</p><p>Gwen lay on her cot, pretending to sleep. Outside the walls of the trailer she shared with Hailey Barnes, the Hagadera refugee camp was coming to life. Diesel engines rumbled in the distance as the morning&#x2019;s first supply convoy arrived. Closer, two men shouted to each other in their clicking African language. &#x201c;Happy Birthday,&#x201d; Gwen murmured to herself. Her twenty-third. The first she&#x2019;d spent outside the United States, much less in Africa.</p><p>For twelve weeks Gwen had volunteered for WorldCares/ChildrenFirst, an aid agency that offered food and medical care to Somali refugees. The Somalis came to Kenya to escape famine and war. Hundreds of thousands lived in Hagadera and other camps around the town of Dadaab in eastern Kenya. At first the mission had seemed simple to Gwen. Feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, protect the innocent. But the longer she stayed, the less she understood this place.</p><p>She tried not to think about that, either.</p><p>Her alarm beeped. She gave up the charade of sleep, opened her eyes. Seven-thirty a.m. Rise and shine. Across the trailer, Hailey&#x2019;s cot was empty. Hailey always left before Gwen. She claimed she liked to watch the sun rise. Gwen thought she might have something going with Jasper, the ex-Marine who ran security at their compound, but Hailey denied they were anything but friends. I just like the place when it&#x2019;s quiet, she said.</p><p>Gwen wrapped herself in her thin cotton blanket, reached for her laptop. WorldCares housed its workers in a walled compound at the edge of the Hagadera camp. The compound had its own electricity and water and wireless service, not great but enough to download email.</p><p>She found twenty-two new messages on her Gmail account, mainly birthday greetings. Her little sister Catelyn had sent a picture of them by the Golden Gate Bridge, one of Gwen&#x2019;s favorites, from a trip to California the year before.</p><p>Only four more weeks of do-gooding! Can&#x2019;t wait for you to get home so I can buy you a 3 a.m. Egg McMuffin&#x2014;hinting at an epic night on that trip. Tell Hailey The Heartbreaker I said hi! Owen and Scott too! Happy 23rd! XOXO C</p><p>Next up, from her mom:</p><p>Daddy and I will call today but if you&#x2019;re busy or we don&#x2019;t get through I want you to know how much we love, love, LOVE you! And we&#x2019;re so proud of you, what you&#x2019;re doing over there is so great&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>So great. If they only knew. Gwen signed off, pulled on sweatpants and a long-sleeved shirt for the walk to the bathroom trailer. On her first morning here, she&#x2019;d made the mistake of stepping out in boyshorts and a thin cotton tee. She hadn&#x2019;t gotten ten steps before a crusty forty-something woman intercepted her.</p><p>&#x201c;This is a refugee camp, not a gentlemen&#x2019;s club,&#x201d; the woman barked in a thick British accent. &#x201c;We respect local sensitivities. As I don&#x2019;t doubt you&#x2019;re aware, you have a very pleasant body&#x201d;&#x2014;somehow &#x201c;pleasant&#x201d; sounded like an accusation&#x2014;&#x201c;but if you want to dress like a Russian whore I suggest Moscow. You&#x2019;d do well.&#x201d;</p><p>Whore? Moscow? Gwen wanted to argue but instead hustled back to her trailer. She later learned the woman was Moss Laughton, the logistics director for WorldCares. Moss&#x2019;s moods ranged from bad to worse. Still, Gwen had grown to like her after that initial run-in. Maybe because they couldn&#x2019;t be more different. The British woman had short spiky hair and was shaped like a potato. She didn&#x2019;t care how she looked or what people said about her. And she wasn&#x2019;t afraid to yell. She once described her job to Gwen as trying to keep the stealing to a reasonable level. And failing.</p><p>Gwen decided to give herself an extra-long, extra-hot shower this morning. Moss wouldn&#x2019;t be amused. Moss said any shower more than three minutes long was a waste of time and water. But it wasn&#x2019;t Moss&#x2019;s birthday, was it?</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>The Hagadera camp was one of three giant refugee centers near Dadaab, an overgrown village on the dusty plains of eastern Kenya. The camps opened in 1991, when Somalia&#x2019;s government first collapsed. For most of their existence they&#x2019;d held fewer than one hundred thousand refugees. But since 2009, drought and war had caused hundreds of thousands of Somalis to flee their homes. With nowhere else to go, they trekked west across the desert toward Kenya. Along the way, bandits stole from them and raped them. If they were too weak to walk, they got left behind. And not for the Rapture. They died of dehydration or starvation. Hyenas and lions dragged away their corpses. Even when they reached Kenya, they weren&#x2019;t safe. The Kenyan police demanded bribes and threw the Somalis back over the border if they didn&#x2019;t pay. But enough refugees got through that half a million now lived in the camps, in endless rows of tents that studded the land like anthills. Some received sturdy white tents that looked like they belonged in an upscale camping expedition. Abercrombie and Kent: Journey to Dadaab. The others built their own shelters out of plastic sheets and scraps of wood. Vast open plains surrounded the camps, but the Kenyan government refused to expand them. So the tents were crammed into ever-smaller plots as new refugees arrived. Each was a miniature city of refugees, with a city&#x2019;s problems.</p><p>Gwen hadn&#x2019;t known any of this when she&#x2019;d come to Dadaab three months before, with Hailey and Owen Broder and Scott Thompson. The four of them had just graduated from the University of Montana, in Missoula. Gwen had grown up in western Montana, lived there her whole life. She was ready for a change. An adventure.</p><p>Then Scott said he might go to Kenya to work for his uncle James helping refugees. Gwen was surprised. Scott had never struck her as caring. In fact, when it came to women, she knew firsthand he was exactly the opposite. But he told her that James ran a charity called WorldCares. &#x201c;We can go to Africa for a few months. Beats hanging around here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Plus when we&#x2019;re done, we&#x2019;ll go on a safari. Watch lions getting it on. You know they have sex for like two days straight.&#x201d; Scott sounded at least as enthusiastic about the lions as the refugees.</p><p>That night she Googled Dadaab. The pictures shocked her. She couldn&#x2019;t believe people still starved to death. Of course, anorexia, but that was different. Anyway, the point was that the refugees were starving. United Nations says 750,000 Somalis at risk from famine, the headlines said. Worst food shortage since 1991. Babies with bellies swollen from hunger. Women with arms like sticks. Gwen decided right then that she&#x2019;d go. Do whatever it was that aid workers did.</p><p>When she told her family about her plan, she figured her mom&#x2014;and certainly her dad&#x2014;would put up a fight. Aside from a few weekends in Canada, she&#x2019;d only been out of the United States once, on a spring break trip to Canc�n. But they didn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be good for you,&#x201d; her mom said. &#x201c;Broaden your horizons.&#x201d;</p><p>Then Hailey decided to come, too. She told Gwen she wanted a better shot at med school. She&#x2019;d applied her senior year, but her test scores weren&#x2019;t great and the only place that accepted her was in the Caribbean. &#x201c;This stuff looks great on your r�sum�,&#x201d; Hailey said. &#x201c;In the interviews, too. &#x2018;When I saw little Dikembe come back to life, I knew I wanted to be a healer.&#x2019; I don&#x2019;t have to tell them that the kind of healing I&#x2019;m talking about is dermatology. Laser skin peels for five hundred dollars a pop.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that a little cynical?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a lot cynical. But doctors make mucho dinero and, unlike you, I can&#x2019;t afford the luxury of being an idealist.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not rich.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gwennie, rich people always say that.&#x201d;</p><p>Finally, Owen joined up. He didn&#x2019;t have to explain why. Gwen knew. He&#x2019;d had a terrible crush on her for two years. Though he wasn&#x2019;t a stalker. More a hopeless romantic. He gave her longing looks when he thought she wouldn&#x2019;t notice. She wished she found him attractive. But he was curly-haired, soulful. Gwen didn&#x2019;t go for soulful. Gwen went for jocks. Jerks. Like Scott. Scott was about six-two, two-fifteen, with sandy blond hair and broad shoulders and a ridiculous six-pack. Scott could dunk. Gwen had seen him. When Scott wrapped an arm around her, she felt held. She was starting to rethink Scott and all the Scotts of the world. One had given her a bad herpes scare a few months back. But for now she was still in the jock-jerk camp.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Back in her trailer, post-shower, Gwen tugged on cargo pants and boots and a black T-shirt that she knew flattered her. Though, in truth, she would have looked good in sackcloth. She had the honey-blond hair and long lean legs of a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader. She stood out absurdly in the camp&#x2019;s crowds, an alien from Planet Beautiful.</p><p>But her looks hardly mattered here. The refugee kids wanted to touch her hair, sure. Their parents wanted more rations, a chance for an American visa. When they realized she couldn&#x2019;t help, they moved on. She was just another aid worker here, unworthy of special attention. The realization unsettled her. She wondered if she was seeing what life would be like when she was sixty.</p><p>She walked to the WorldCares canteen, a concrete room with a gas-fired stove and two oversized refrigerators. Posters of missions covered the walls, smiling black and brown children surrounding white volunteers. Owen and Scott sat at a wooden table, spooning up oatmeal from chipped bowls.</p><p>&#x201c;Oatmeal?&#x201d; They hadn&#x2019;t had any yesterday. Gwen poured a cup of coffee, busied herself brewing a fresh pot. Leaving the coffeemaker empty was a great sin at WorldCares. As Moss had made sure she learned.</p><p>&#x201c;Bunch of Quaker Instant came in yesterday,&#x201d; Owen said. &#x201c;All kinds. Apples and cinnamon, brown sugar and whatever&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pepsi&#x2019;s getting a nice tax deduction on that, I&#x2019;ll bet,&#x201d; Scott said.</p><p>&#x201c;Pepsi?&#x201d; Gwen didn&#x2019;t get it.</p><p>&#x201c;They own Quaker. Stuff&#x2019;s about to expire, they can&#x2019;t sell it, so they give it to us, write it off at full price. Everybody wins.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I get it.&#x201d; Just because she didn&#x2019;t know that Pepsi owned Quaker didn&#x2019;t make her stupid. Or did it? Other people always seemed to know things she didn&#x2019;t. But then, she&#x2019;d never tried very hard in school. Around sixth grade, she&#x2019;d realized that boys would do her homework. She didn&#x2019;t even have to fool around with them unless she wanted to. They were happy to be near her. This band, the Hold Steady, had a song called &#x201c;You Can Make Him Like You.&#x201d; And it was true. All the way through college, where she&#x2019;d barely graduated with a 2.1 in sociology. Even that had required her to flirt with a professor senior year so he would let her retake her final. Not that she&#x2019;d slept with him. He was old. And married. But she&#x2019;d gone to his study hours dressed in her cutest gray yoga pants, the ones that cupped her ass perfectly, and made sure to lean over his desk and let him see the black thong poking out where her T-shirt didn&#x2019;t reach. She knew that her moves were obvious, and she knew he knew too. But she&#x2019;d learned that men didn&#x2019;t care. They could be fully aware they were being played and still enjoy the game. No doubt he was filing her image away for later, when he was having boring sex with his wife for the millionth time.</p><p>So she&#x2019;d gotten her C&#x2019;s, and she was a college graduate, nobody could take that away. But she wondered if she should have studied a little harder. For this trip she&#x2019;d bought a Kindle, loaded it with a bunch of famous books she hadn&#x2019;t read, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> and <i>Invisible Man</i> and whatever. She&#x2019;d forced her way through them, too. But she had to admit she didn&#x2019;t really enjoy them. Maybe she should have tried <i>Twilight</i> and <i>The Hunger Games</i>; a lot of her friends liked those.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening today?&#x201d; Gwen said. Besides my birthday. She wondered if they&#x2019;d forgotten.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m meeting with James about that reporter coming next week,&#x201d; Owen said.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, from Houston. He wants a list of talking points for everybody, make sure we&#x2019;re all on message about the mission. Talk about our local partners, how we do more than just hand out food, all that stuff.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Spin, in other words,&#x201d; Scott said. &#x201c;Make sure WorldCares gets mentioned along with CARE and MSF and the big boys. Publicity means donations. So if you have any questions about what we&#x2019;re doing over here, keep them to yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Gwen had come to Dadaab imagining herself hand-feeding starving kids, handing out bowls of soup to grateful villagers. She saw now that she hadn&#x2019;t had a clue how refugee camps operated. Only the most recent arrivals were hungry. A massive operation existed precisely to keep the refugees from starving. In that narrow sense, the camps worked. The Somalis who lived here ate better than their countrymen across the border&#x2014;or the Kenyan villagers who lived nearby. Many refugees sold portions of their food rations in local markets.</p><p>At the same time, the refugees were stuck in legal limbo. Kenyans didn&#x2019;t want Somalis any more than most Americans wanted Mexican immigrants. As far as the Kenyan government was concerned, the camps were too large and had been open too long. So Kenya didn&#x2019;t allow the refugees to own land or work legally. They weren&#x2019;t even supposed to leave the camps, although as a practical matter the Kenyan police couldn&#x2019;t stop them. Most of all, the government didn&#x2019;t want the refugees organizing for political rights or citizenship.</p><p>So the refugees couldn&#x2019;t work or farm. They were warehoused in relative safety, and they would never starve. But they were basically prisoners. Like prisoners, they spent much of their time chasing freebies. Their requests ranged from the petty&#x2014;<i>My ration of cooking oil was short last week</i>&#x2014;to the heartbreaking&#x2014;<i>My brother disappeared at the border two months ago. Can you help me find him?</i> If you weren&#x2019;t a doctor, opportunities for genuine heroism were few and far between at Dadaab.</p><p>Recently, Gwen had been spending her time with kids. The average Somali woman had six children, and the camps didn&#x2019;t have nearly enough schools to accommodate them. The girls stayed close by their mothers. The boys played with raggedy soccer balls and pretended to shoot one another. WorldCares had boxes of donated children&#x2019;s books stored in the back of its warehouse. They&#x2019;d arrived a few months before, but no one knew what to do with them. The kids couldn&#x2019;t speak English, much less read it. The boxes sat untouched as the food deliveries came and went. Just thinking about them depressed Gwen, made her think of all the books she hadn&#x2019;t read.</p><p>About a month before, she had gone into the warehouse and grabbed the first book she found, a copy of <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i>. She took the choice as a sign. All the books she could have picked, and she&#x2019;d come up with one she remembered. She took it to the front gate and stood outside reading until a boy wandered over to listen to her. Since then she&#x2019;d come out every day, picking a different book each time. Some days only a couple kids showed up. Some days, twenty or so. Only one, a tiny boy named Joseph who had the whitest teeth Gwen had ever seen, understood more than a few words of English. He had taken upon himself the role of translator. Gwen figured he was adding his own commentary, because he o...</p></p><h2>The Adventures of John Carson in Several Quarters of the World: A Novel of Robert Louis Stevenson</h2><p><p><b>"An affectionate homage...a loving reconstruction of an era of storytelling now lost." &#x2015;<i>The New York Times</i></b></p><p><b>"[A] triumph...If a writer is going to put on Stevenson&#x2019;s voice, he&#x2019;d better, as the poets say, 'bring it.'

In this first-ever history of contemporary liberal theory, Katrina Forrester shows how liberal egalitarianism&#x2015;a set of ideas about justice, equality, obligation, and the state&#x2015;became dominant, and traces its emergence from the political and ideological context of the postwar United States and Britain.</p><p>In the aftermath of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War, Rawls&#x2019;s <i>A Theory of Justice</i> made a particular kind of liberalism essential to political philosophy. Using archival sources, Forrester explores the ascent and legacy of this form of liberalism by examining its origins in midcentury debates among American antistatists and British egalitarians. She traces the roots of contemporary theories of justice and inequality, civil disobedience, just war, global and intergenerational justice, and population ethics in the 1960s and &#x2019;70s and beyond. In these years, political philosophers extended, developed, and reshaped this liberalism as they responded to challenges and alternatives on the left and right&#x2015;from the New International Economic Order to the rise of the New Right. These thinkers remade political philosophy in ways that influenced not only their own trajectory but also that of their critics.</p><p>Recasting the history of late twentieth-century political thought and providing novel interpretations and fresh perspectives on major political philosophers, <i>In the Shadow of Justice</i> offers a rigorous look at liberalism&#x2019;s ambitions and limits.</p></p><p>An intellectual history of postwar Anglo-American political philosophy focus in particular on its transformation under the influence of John Rawl&#39;s Theory of Justice.<b>Katrina Forrester</b> is assistant professor of government and social studies at Harvard University.

Supernatural thrills, adventure and suspense, colorful settings, and, in the better examples, literary quality are all present. Unfortunately, true Gothic novels (not simply modern detective stories called "Gothic") are extremely rare books, and have never been as available as they should be.The first member in this collection, Horace Walpole's <i>The</i><i>Castle of Otranto</i>, published as a Christmas book for 1764, was the first and one of the greatest members of the genre. It has also been one of the most influential books in history. It motivated the Gothic revival in the arts, and it probably did more to usher in the early-19th-century Romanticism than any other single work. It also served as the model in plot, characterizations, settings, and tone for &nbsp;hundreds, perhaps thousands of successors.<i>Vathek</i>, by the eccentric British millionaire William Beckford, is generally considered to be the high point of the Oriental tale in English literature. Certainly no one has ever written (in any European tongue) a story which better unifies the stirrings of Gothic romanticism with the color, poetry, and vivacity of the original <i>Arabian Nights</i>.The third novel in this collection, John Polidor's <i>Vampyre</i>, emerged from the same soir�es of ghost-story telling in Geneva that produced Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i>. The first full-length vampire story in English, it initiated a very important literary chain that also leads up to the present. Included with Polidori's novel is Lord Byron's little-known <i>Fragment,</i> from which Polidori (who was Byron's physician in Switzerland) plagiarized his plot.These three novels (and the fragment) are still well worth reading. Generations of readers have found thrills and horrors in Walpole's fine work, while <i>Vathek</i> cannot be excelled in its unusual mixture of the bizarre, cruel irony, and masterful narration. Polidori's thriller still conveys chills, and the <i>Fragment</i> makes us all wish that Byron had completed his novel.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Mario Praz</b> (1896-1982) was Professor of English Language and Literature at the University of Rome.

Capturing her mother&#39;s &#34;a pinch of this&#34; technique, she has re-created recipes for everything from Arabic Bread, Lentil Soup, and Eggplant Salad, to Baked Fish with Tahini Sauce, Supreme Lamb Stew with Kibbi, and the classic Cucumber Yogurt Salad.</p><p>Other areas of the Middle East have their own distinctive cooking traditions. <i>Lebanese Cuisine</i> offers light foods with strong flavors of cinnamon, allspice, and lemons. The late Farah compiled her list of the best Lebanese recipes and made them easy to reproduce in American kitchens. Tabbuli, here called Arabic salad supreme, with its liberal amounts of fresh parsley and mint, appeals to many tastes. Dishes with names on the order of epiphany sweet and Arabic sausage made from pork recall Lebanon's sizeable Arab Christian community. But pork and beef are still exceptions, lamb predominating in Lebanese dishes from crunchy Kibbi in all its variations to Kafta, broiled ground meat. A lack of pictures may deter those not conversant with Lebanese cooking from trying some recipes since it's not always clear what the finished dish ought to look like. <i>Mark Knoblauch</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Like when I saw the snow?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why not to talk about it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister puts her arm around me and rocks us sideways, left and right, as we sit on the schoolroom bench. The warmth and the hug and the rocking ease my mind and I rock back against Sallo, bumping her a little. But I can&#x2019;t keep from remembering what I saw, the dreadful excitement of it, and pretty soon I burst out, &#x201c;But I ought to tell them! It was an invasion! They could warn the soldiers to be ready!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And they&#x2019;d say&#x2014;when?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That stumps me. &#x201c;Well, just ready.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But what if it doesn&#x2019;t happen for a long time? They&#x2019;d be angry at you for giving a false alarm. And then if an army did invade the city, they&#x2019;d want to know how you knew.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;d tell them I remembered it!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Sallo says. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ever tell them about remembering the way you do. They&#x2019;ll say you have a power. And they don&#x2019;t like people to have powers.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t! Just sometimes I remember things that are going to happen!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I know. But Gavir, listen, truly, you mustn&#x2019;t talk about it to anybody. Not anybody but me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Sallo says my name in her soft voice, when she says, &#x201c;Listen, truly,&#x201d; I do truly listen to her. Even though I argue.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not even Tib?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not even Tib.&#x201d; Her round, brown face and dark eyes are quiet and serious.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Because only you and I are Marsh people.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So was Gammy!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It was Gammy that told me what I&#x2019;m telling you. That Marsh people have powers, and the city people are afraid of them. So we never talk about anything we can do that they can&#x2019;t. It would be dangerous. Really dangerous. Promise, Gav.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She puts up her hand, palm out. I fit my grubby paw against it to make the vow. &#x201c;I promise,&#x201d; I say as she says, &#x201c;I hear.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her other hand she&#x2019;s holding the little Ennu-M� she wears on a cord around her neck.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She kisses the top of my head and then bumps me so hard I nearly fall off the end of the bench. But I won&#x2019;t laugh; I&#x2019;m so full of what I remembered, it was so awful and so frightening, I want to talk about it, to tell everybody, to say, &#x201c;Look out, look out! Soldiers are coming, enemies, with a green flag, setting the city on fire!&#x201d; I sit swinging my legs, sullen and mournful.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Tell me about it again,&#x201d; Sallo says. &#x201c;Tell all the bits you left out.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#x2019;s what I need. And I tell her again my memory of the soldiers coming up the street.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes what I remember has a secret feeling about it, as if it belongs to me, like a gift that I can keep and take out and look at when I&#x2019;m by myself, like the eagle feather Yaven-d� gave me. The first thing I ever remembered, the place with the reeds and the water, is like that. I&#x2019;ve never told anybody about it, not even Sallo. There&#x2019;s nothing to tell; just the silvery-blue water, and reeds in the wind, and sunlight, and a blue hill way off. Lately I have a new remembering: the man in the high room in shadows who turns around and says my name. I haven&#x2019;t told anybody that. I don&#x2019;t need to.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there&#x2019;s the other kind of remembering, or seeing, or whatever it is, like when I remembered seeing the Father come home from Pagadi, and his horse was lame; only he hadn&#x2019;t come home yet and didn&#x2019;t until next summer, and then he came just as I remembered, on the lame horse. And once I remembered all the streets of the city turning white, and the roofs turning white, and the air full of tiny white birds all whirling and flying downward. I wanted to tell everybody about that, it was so amazing, and I did. Most of them didn&#x2019;t listen. I was only four or five then. But it snowed, later that winter. Everybody ran outside to see the snowfall, a thing that happens in Etra maybe once in a hundred years, so that we children didn&#x2019;t even know what it was called. Gammy asked me, &#x201c;Is this what you saw? Was it like this?&#x201d; And I told her and all of them it was just what I&#x2019;d seen, and she and Tib and Sallo believed me. That must have been when Gammy told Sallo what Sallo had just told me, not to talk about things I remembered that way. Gammy was old and sick then, and she died in the spring after the snowfall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then I&#x2019;d only had the secret rememberings, until this morning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was by myself early in the morning, sweeping the hall outside the nursery rooms, when I began remembering. At first I just remembered looking down a city street and seeing fire leap up from a house roof and hearing shouts. The shouts got louder, and I recognised Long Street, running north from the square behind the Forefathers&#x2019; Shrine. At the far end of the street smoke was billowing out in big greasy clouds with red flames inside them. People were running past me, all over the square, women and men, most of them running towards the Senate Square, shouting and calling out, but city guards ran by in the other direction with their swords drawn. Then I could see soldiers at the far end of Long Street under a green banner; they had long lances, and the ones on horseback had swords. The guards met with them, and there was deep shouting, and ringing and clashing like a smithy, and the whole crowd of men, a great writhing knot of armor and helmets and bare arms and swords, came closer and closer. A horse broke from it, galloping up the street straight at me, riderless, lathered with white sweat streaked red, blood running from where its eye should be. The horse was screaming. I dodged back from it. And then I was in the hall with a broom in my hand, remembering it. I was still terrified. It was so clear I couldn&#x2019;t forget it at all. I kept seeing it again, and seeing more. I had to tell somebody.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when Sallo and I went to get the schoolroom ready and were there alone, I told her. And now I told her all over again, and telling it made me remember it again, and I could see and tell it better. Sallo listened intently and shivered when I described the horse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What kind of helmets did they have?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked at the memory of the men fighting in the street.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Black, mostly. One of them had a black crest, like a horse&#x2019;s tail.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Do you think they were from Osc?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t have those long wood shields like the Oscan captives in the parade. It was like all their armor was metal&#x2014;bronze or iron&#x2014;it made this huge clanging sound when they were fighting with the guards with swords. I think they came from Morva.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who came from Morva, Gav?&#x201d; said a pleasant voice behind us, and we both jumped like puppets on strings. It was Yaven. Intent on my story, neither of us had heard him, and we had no idea how long he&#x2019;d been listening. We reverenced him quickly and Sallo said, &#x201c;Gav was telling me one of his stories, Yaven-d�.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sounds like a good one,&#x201d; Yaven said. &#x201c;Troops from Morva would march with a black-and-white banner, though.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who has green?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Casicar.&#x201d; He sat down on the front bench, stretching out his long legs. Yaven Altanter Arca was seventeen, the eldest son of the Father of our House. He was an officer in training of the Etran army, and away on duty much of the time now, but when he was home he came to the schoolroom for lessons just as he used to. We loved having him there because, being grown up, he made us all feel grown up, and because he was always good-natured, and because he knew how to get ...</p><h2>Holy Spirit In You</h2><p>Derek Prince clearly explains the ways of the Holy Spirit and how He works in the lives of Christians.

His sympathetic portrayal of White characters in his stories, in the plays The Days of the Turbins (The White Guard), which enjoyed great success at the Moscow Arts Theatre in 1926, and Flight (1927), and his satirical treatment of the officials of the New Economic Plan, led to growing criticism, which became violent after the play The Purple Island. He also wrote a brilliant biography of his literary hero, Jean-Baptiste Moliere, but The Master and Margarita is generally considered his masterpiece.

Hefner in <i>Playboy</i>. <i>Playboy's Silverstein Around the World</i> not only reproduces these fascinating articles in facsimile form, it also provides an introduction with never-before-seen photos and drawings and rare, illuminating biographical detail. </p><p> Beginning in May 1957 with "Return to Tokyo," the pieces reproduced in this book took Silverstein from Scandinavia to Africa and the Middle East, from Paris and London to Moscow, ending in the summer of 1968 with the two-part epic "Silverstein Among the Hippies." This unique collection is a legacy of the close relationship between Silverstein and Hefner, who saw the great potential of this particular combination of artist and assignment, and the social revolution led by <i>Playboy</i> in the 1950s and 1960s. </p><p> With its wry, ribald humor and beautifully produced color illustrations, this tableau of the mid-twentieth-century world is sure to please and fascinate Silverstein's millions of fans.</p></p><p><b>Shel Silverstein</b> is best known as a children's-book author who wrote and illustrated a number of bestselling books that have charmed millions of readers of all ages. Crossing many artistic boundaries, he was also a noted songwriter and an accomplshed playwright. Silverstein first came to prominence in the 1950s as a cartoonist for <i>Playboy</i>, where he assumed the role of roving ambassador for the up-and-coming magazine. This esteemed assignment -- due in no small part to his friendship with Hugh M. Hefner -- was the auspicious beginning of a most amazing career. Shel Silverstein died in 1999.Best known as a children's author but also a successful songwriter ("A Boy Named Sue") and playwright, Silverstein started out as a cartoonist. In the 1950s and 1960s, <i>Playboy </i>sent him around the world to draw a travel journal. His 23 dispatches hailed from such far-flung locales as Japan, Moscow, London, Paris, and Africa, as well as such closer-to-home precincts as Greenwich Village, Haight-Ashbury, White Sox training camp, and a nudist colony. Most of the cartoons' gags play against cultural stereotypes, with a befuddled Silverstein as the butt of the joke: in a gorgeously limned Swiss village, he complains, "I'll give them 15 more minutes and if nobody yodels, I'm going back to the hotel." Befitting their provenance, many depict Silverstein's efforts to score with the local damsels. They feature the same deceptively casual line work that makes his children's books so visually compelling, and since far too little of Silverstein's work for adults is currently available, this engaging document of the countries he visited and of its era is a welcome delight. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Serves 8</p><p>8 ounces extra-firm tofu, pressed, see Try Cooking with Tofu</p><p>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</p><p>1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</p><p>1� teaspoons Dijon mustard</p><p>� teaspoon garlic powder</p><p>� cup light olive oil (or 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil and 2 tablespoons canola oil)</p><p>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p><p>8 slices whole-grain bread, lightly toasted</p><p>4 to 5 medium-size ripe tomatoes, preferably organic, cored and sliced</p><p>16 slices English cucumber</p><p>� cup Pickled Red Onions</p><p>� cup roughly chopped assorted fresh herbs, such as basil, oregano, parsley, and chives</p><p>Cut the pressed tofu into small chunks and transfer them to the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Add the lemon juice, parsley, mustard, and garlic powder and pulse 10 to 15 times. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and then pulse for about 15 seconds.</p><p>With the food processor running, slowly drizzle the oil through the feed tube into the tofu mixture, blending until it is the consistency of mayonnaise, 2 to 3 minutes. If necessary, thin the tofu with water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and pulse to mix. Set aside until ready to use, or transfer to a container with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate for up to 10 days.</p><p>Spread about 1 tablespoon of tofu spread on each slice of toast. Top with the tomato and cucumber slices and season to taste with salt and pepper.</p><p>Top each open-faced sandwich with pickled onions and a generous sprinkling of fresh herbs.</p><p>Try Cooking with Tofu</p><p>Also called bean curd, tofu is sold according to texture: silken, soft, medium, firm, and extra-firm. It&#x2019;s ivory colored and mild tasting&#x2014;and for those who eat it regularly, it&#x2019;s just about a perfect protein.</p><p>Tofu nearly always is sold packed in water and before it&#x2019;s cooked, it should be drained, rinsed, and drained again. It usually comes in one-pound blocks and for some recipes should be weighted (pressed) for about an hour. To do so, put the drained tofu on top of several layers of paper towels on a plate, top it with another plate, and set a can or heavy pan that weighs about a pound on top of the plate. Let this construction stand for about an hour, during which time excess moisture will be released.</p><p>Roasted Summer Vegetable Panini with Goat Cheese</p><p>CHUCK: A roasted vegetable panini is a welcome light lunch, afternoon snack, or quick preconcert meal. I make them with just about any and all vegetables&#x2014;Sheryl never complains!&#x2014;but this mixture of peppers, squash, and mushrooms is one of our favorites. The balsamic vinegar gives the veggies deep-throated sweetness, while the goat cheese provides delicious creaminess and eliminates the need for any sort of mayonnaise or other dressing. Serves 4</p><p>2 portobello mushrooms, stems and gills removed, sliced</p><p>1 red bell pepper, seeded, membranes removed, and julienned</p><p>1 large yellow squash, cut into �-inch-thick slices</p><p>1 large zucchini, cut into �-inch-thick slices</p><p>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing on the panini</p><p>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</p><p>2 teaspoons dried thyme</p><p>2 teaspoons garlic powder</p><p>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p><p>2 whole-grain or whole-wheat French baguettes, about 12 inches long</p><p>4 to 6 ounces soft goat cheese</p><p>1� cups fresh spinach</p><p>Preheat the oven to 400�F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly oil it with olive oil.</p><p>In a large bowl, toss the mushrooms, bell pepper, yellow squash, and zucchini together. Drizzle the vegetables with the olive oil and vinegar and toss to coat evenly. Add the thyme and garlic powder and season to taste with salt and pepper, tossing to evenly distribute the seasonings.</p><p>Spread the vegetables on the baking sheet and roast for about 15 minutes or until the vegetables are fork tender and their colors have perked up. There is no need to stir the vegetables as they roast.</p><p>Meanwhile, slice the baguette in half lengthwise. Spread the goat cheese on the top half of each.</p><p>Remove the vegetables from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 350�F.</p><p>Arrange the roasted vegetables on the bottom half of each baguette and top with spinach. Press the tops of the baguettes on the spinach and cut each sandwich in half for 4 sandwiches.</p><p>Line the baking sheet with a fresh sheet of foil and put the halved baguettes on the center of the baking sheet. Brush the top of the sandwiches with olive oil and then top with a sheet of foil.</p><p>Put a second baking sheet over the top of the sandwiches and press down on the sheet to compress the sandwiches. (You can also top the sandwiches with a heavy saucepan or saut� pan to weight them.) Transfer both baking sheets to the oven and bake the panini for 10 to 12 minutes or until the bread is golden and crusty and the goat cheese is oozing from the sides of the sandwiches.</p><p>Carefully remove the panini from between the baking sheets and put on a cutting board. Cut the halves in half again.</p><p>Lime-Kissed Stuffed Avocados</p><p>CHUCK: I make these stuffed avocados pretty regularly when we&#x2019;re on the road. Everyone loves them because just about everyone likes avocados and they are filling without being heavy&#x2014;the perfect snack or light meal. Serves 4</p><p>4 ripe avocados</p><p>4 teaspoons fresh lime juice</p><p>1� teaspoons kosher salt</p><p>1 teaspoon ground cumin</p><p>1 teaspoon garlic powder</p><p>� teaspoon black pepper</p><p>4 tablespoons fresh store-bought salsa, preferably organic</p><p>Blue corn or flax seed tortillas, preferably organic</p><p>Cut the avocados into halves and remove pits. Carefully scoop the flesh from each avocado, leaving the skins intact so that you can refill them. Transfer the avocado flesh to a glass mixing bowl. Add the lime juice, salt, cumin, garlic powder, and pepper and mash with a fork or potato masher. Taste and adjust the seasoning.</p><p>Spoon the avocado back into the scooped-out skins. Garnish the top of each with a tablespoon of fresh salsa.</p><p>Serve with organic blue corn or flax seed tortillas.</p><p>Avocados, Avocados, Avocados</p><p>I repeat the word three times because Sheryl and I just can&#x2019;t get enough. Luckily, they are easy to come by just about anywhere, with the large winter crops coming into the stores in January and February. To tell if an avocado is ripe, hold it in your hand and exert gentle pressure. It should give nicely, but not feel mushy (similar to determining the ripeness of a peach).</p><p>You can buy hard avocados and let them ripen on the counter, but that can take up to a week. To speed up the ripening process, place the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana, and they should ripen in a day or so. Avocados are packed with good stuff for your body: They may contain more fat than other fruits, but the fat is a &#x201c;good&#x201d; one&#x2014;about 30 percent of each fruit consists of healthful monounsaturated fat, which helps lower cholesterol. Its rich folate content helps prevent strokes. Avocados are also high in oleic acid (as is olive oil), which guards against breast cancer. What else? Evidently certain nutrients are absorbed more effectively when avocados are part of a meal, and the fruit is a great source of vitamin E. It&#x2019;s no small wonder both Sheryl and I like these glorious little powerhouses of great flavor and good health.</p><p>Cashew Butter and Fruit &#x201c;Caviar&#x201d;</p><p>CHUCK: What I love about this appetizer is how unexpected it is. The slightly tart fruit caviar&#x2014;so called because the texture of the fruit-flavored tapioca resembles caviar&#x2014;is served with homemade cashew butter. The result? Something like a very grownup peanut butter and jelly treat. Serves 15 to 20</p><p>Cashew Butter</p><p>2 cups roasted, unsalted cashews</p><p>1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</p><p>1 teaspoon agave nectar</p><p>� teaspoon kosher salt</p><p>2 to 3 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil</p><p>Fruit &#x201c;Caviar&#x201d;</p><p>3 cups sugar-free fruit juice, such as grape or apricot, preferably organic</p><p>� cup uncooked tapioca pearls</p><p>30 to 40 melba toasts, crostini, or other small crackers</p><p>To make the cashew butter: In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, pulse the cashews, lemon juice, agave nectar, and salt 2 to 3 times until the nuts are crumbled and starting to form a paste.</p><p>With the processor running, drizzle the oil into the nut mixture until it comes together into a smooth butter. This won&#x2019;t be as smooth as creamy peanut butter but will have a little texture. If the butter is very thick, add a little water through the feed tube with the motor running, 1 teaspoon at a time. You should have about 2 cups of nut butter.</p><p>To make the caviar: In a small saucepan, bring the juice to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the juice until the amount red...</p></p><h2>Williamsburg Before and After: The Rebirth of Virginia&#39;s Colonial Capital</h2><p>George Yetter&#39;s informative text describes why Williamsburg was founded and flourished during the colonial period.

Lit Guild &amp; Doubleday Main.</p><p>Precise details change with the ages, but you can bet that the first story ever written had something to do with revenge. Sandra Brown continues the tradition with her latest brick of a book, <i>Fat Tuesday</i>. After a gruff 'n' tuff New Orleans narc, Burke Basile, mistakenly blows a hole in his partner's noggin, he vows revenge--not only on the thug who was directly involved, but also on the sleazy kingpin behind it all. And in finest cop-drama tradition, he vows to do it outside the law. <i>Fat Tuesday</i> only begins to cook after Basile turns in his badge and--mixing charm and coercion--enlists various underworld elements in his cause. It's all a little B movie-ish at times, but for every hooker with a heart of gold, there's a fresher character like Gregory, the homosexual hustler who uses his drama degree to Basile's benefit. The villains are bad (can't go wrong with a lawyer), the heroine good, and the hero a big, wounded warrior looking for true love. What's not to like?Burke Basile is a cop with nothing left to lose. Responsible for his partner&#39;s death, his marriage and his career over, he focuses on his nemesis, Pinkie Duvall, a flamboyant attorney who helps killers evade justice. Burke&#39;s shocking revenge centers around kidnapping Remy, the lawyer&#39;s trophy wife. But Burke hasn&#39;t planned on the electric attraction he&#39;ll feel for this desperate woman, who rose from the slums of New Orleans to marry a man she can never love. Nor could he have ever predicted the fierce duel that will explode amid the Mardi Gras madness, as the clock ticks toward midnight on Fat Tuesday -- when all masks are stripped away, and Burke must confront his own ugly secret.</p><h2>Shackleton</h2><p>This biography of Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton is a story of epic endurance and courage and also of tragic ineptitude, hardship, bitter rivalries, betrayal, and ultimately fatal disappointment</p><p>Sir Ernest Shackleton, the Anglo-Irish explorer, never achieved his goal of reaching the South Pole, though he was knighted in 1909 for having come within 100 miles. With bravery matched only by his theatricality, Shackleton sought to top that accomplishment by landing on one side of Antarctica and traveling the width of the icy continent by sledge. What might have been a great exploratory journey turned into a raw struggle for survival when his ship became trapped in pack ice, and he was forced to lead his team on a desperate trek across hundreds of miles of the world's most dangerous terrain. He made it home, but even his stature as one of Edwardian England's greatest heroes could not save Shackleton from financial risk taking; he ended his life mired in debt. Roland Huntford's biography presents a balanced and lively portrait of a man who was, depending on which of his contemporaries you asked, a national hero or a contemptible rogue. <i>--Robert McNamara</i>Roland Huntford is the author of SCOTT AND AMUNDSEN, which was televised as THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH and republished under that name.

Delicate flower prints, fun animal motifs, rich historic scenes, and complex architectural patterns are just some of the subjects reproduced here in rich color. The patterns in Toiles de Jouy are reproduced from an antiquarian book containing 50 plates of French toile fabric and wallpaper patterns. The range of colors is astounding and illustrates that toiles aren&#39;t always simply one color on a neutral ground. Some of the most fascinating were designed originally in multiple colors. A new introduction and stories about the toile patterns give decorators, home designers and Francophiles information about toiles that they&#39;ve never seen before.</p><p>From an antique book of printed samples, the patterns featured in this edition are authentic designs from the Manufacture Royale de Jouy in Jouy-en-Josas. Hence, the name &#34;toiles de Jouy&#34; (being a French pattern printed usually in one color on a light ground; later in three and four colors).Contents A Fabric for All Seasons Country Scenes Classical Scenes &amp; Mythology Indienne Florals Florals Woven Oriental Florals Resources</p><h2>Clint Eastwood: A Biography</h2><p>Through extensive, exclusive interviews with Eastwood (and the friends and colleagues of a lifetime), Time magazine film critic Richard Schickel has penetrated a complex character who has always been understood too quickly, too superficially.

His inimitable drawings and comic poems have become the bedtime staples of millions of children and their parents, but few readers know much about the man behind that wild-eyed, bearded face peering out from the backs of dust jackets.</p><p>In <i>A Boy Named Shel,</i> Lisa Rogak tells the full story of a life as antic and adventurous as any of his creations. A man with an incurable case of wanderlust, Shel kept homes on both coasts and many places in between---and enjoyed regular stays in the Playboy Mansion. Everywhere he went he charmed neighbors, made countless friends, and romanced almost as many women with his unstoppable energy and never-ending wit. </p><p>His boundless creativity brought him fame and fortune---neither of which changed his down-to-earth way of life---and his children&#x2019;s books sold millions of copies.

She lives in New Hampshire. </p>Chapter 1&nbsp;When he was five years old, Shel Silverstein taught himself to draw by tracing over the comic strips in the newspaper. His favorite was Li&#x2019;l Abner by Al Capp.<br>He placed a sheet of paper over the strip and traced over the faces, the hands, the buildings, the scenery, everything. &#x201c;The first thing I did was copy Al Capp,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;He really influenced me. It was the most wondrous thing for me. Al Capp knew how to draw people, shapes, bodies, hands. He knew how to draw well, so I learned how to draw well.&#x201d;<br>He also began to think up stories to go with the cartoons. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t have a lot of friends,&#x201d; said Shel. &#x201c;I just walked around a lot and made up stories in my head. Then I&#x2019;d go home and write them down. That&#x2019;s how I got started.&#x201d;<br>Shel also loved books. Because he was lonely, he turned to books for companionship. &#x201c;One of the things that made me happy was to go to old bookstores and look through the books,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I would hold them, smell them, and even hug them. They were my friends.&#x201d;<br>But he didn&#x2019;t have the money to buy the books he wanted. So he vowed that when he got older and had money, he&#x2019;d spend it on books. He dreamed of a day when he would have so many books on his shelves that he couldn&#x2019;t read all of them in a year if that was the only thing he did.<br>Drawing cartoons and reading books gave him something nothing else could: They gave him comfort.<br>&#x201c;He was a lonely kid,&#x201d; said songwriter Drew Reid, an old friend. &#x201c;He was always aware that he was different from the other kids around him. Let&#x2019;s face it, musicians, artists&#x2014;anybody who&#x2019;s creative&#x2014;we&#x2019;re all kind of wacky because we don&#x2019;t look at stuff the way other people do. And Shel always knew that.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 3, 1891, twenty-nine-year-old Sigmund Balkany, a laborer from Bohemia, arrived at the port of New York aboard the Aller passenger ship along with thousands of other European immigrants who wanted a better life in America. He spent a few years in New York before moving to Chicago.<br>Rae Goldberg was born in Hungary in March of 1876 and immigrated to the United States at the age of twelve. She met Sigmund Balkany in Chicago, and they married in 1897 or 1898. Helen, their first child, was born on January 5,1899.<br>In 1900, Sigmund found work at a tannery, and the family of three rented a house at 911 Milwaukee Avenue near Wicker Park, in a section of Chicago known as West Town. Eastern European Jewish immigrants flocked to the neighborhood, known as a community rich with political radicalism. However, the Milwaukee Avenue corridor also had its share of gangs and violence, which author Nelson Algren described in his 1949 book, The Man with the Golden Arm, the story of a heroin addict released from jail who returns to his old neighborhood and fights to keep from succumbing to the drug again. &#x201c;Louie was the one junkie in ten thousand who&#x2019;d kicked it and kicked it for keeps,&#x201d; wrote Algren. &#x201c;He&#x2019;d taken the sweat cure in a little Milwaukee Avenue hotel room, cutting himself down, as he put it, &#x2018;from monkey to zero.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>By 1910, the growing Balkany family had moved less than a mile west to 2235 West Potomac Avenue, still in West Town but closer to Humboldt Park and in a more residential area. It was a definite step up for the family, since the neighborhood had newer and more spacious housing stock and apartments.<br>Sigmund had left the tannery and opened a small grocery store, where Rae worked alongside him. Their family had expanded with two more daughters: five-year-old Esther, and Martha, who was three.<br>In 1916, seventeen-year-old Helen began clerking for her father at his grocery store located at 2659 Evergreen Avenue, a relatively new building built in 1912 about a mile from their Potomac Avenue home. That move didn&#x2019;t last long, for Sigmund consolidated his family and grocery store and moved them both to 1458 North Washtenaw Avenue the following year, a few blocks away from the previous store. The two-story building was built in 1914 and had five apartments on the second floor and the store at street level. By 1923, Helen was in charge of running the grocery store, and she enjoyed the autonomy it gave her. At the age of twenty-four, an old maid by the standards of the day, she was in no hurry to get married.<br>On December 23,1924, everything changed when her father, Sigmund Balkany, died.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nathan Silverstein was born on July 1, 1890, in either Russia or Poland, the second of five children born to Abraham and Fannie Silverstein. Harry was born a year earlier, and Julius and Jack were born in 1899; a sister, Frieda, followed in 1902.<br>The Silverstein family&#x2019;s journey to America took the form of a chain migration, where one child at a time traveled to the United States&#x2014;typically, the sons went first&#x2014;and once he earned enough funds to send back to the old country, another could afford to come over. Harry arrived in the United States in 1906, and Jack immigrated in 1911. Julius followed in 1913, and Nathan was the last son to immigrate, in 1915. The family initially settled in the Bronx before heading west to Chicago.<br>It was common for brand-new immigrants to enter the military as World War I was raging. Both Julius and Nathan signed up for the military in 1917 and were discharged in April 1918. However, the war interrupted the migration of the family, and Fannie and Frieda didn&#x2019;t arrive in the United States until 1920.<br>By 1923, Jack and Nathan had started a bakery known as Silverstein Brothers and lived with their older brother Harry at 2601 Walton Street. Now established in their own business, they set out to find wives.<br>Nathan found his future wife living about a mile away.<br>There was little time to lose. When Nathan&#x2019;s engagement to Helen Balkany was announced in the Chicago Tribune on June 6, 1926, he was thirty-six and Helen was twenty-seven; the couple was unusually advanced in years during an era where getting married at the age of nineteen meant you were over the hill. They were wed five months later on Halloween 1926, by Rabbi Julien Gusfield at the Hotel Windermere East in Hyde Park. The choice of wedding venue was unusual for a couple from the northwest side of Chicago. The Windermere, hotel residence of Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author Edna Ferber among others, was a pretty swanky location for a 1926 wedding.<br>They may have picked it because the brothers had grand ambitions for their business amidst the heady glamour and free-flowing money of the 1920s. They changed the name of their bakery from Silverstein Brothers to the Service Cake Company and began to plan for the construction of a 105,000-square-foot, one-story brick building at 834&#x2013;38 North Western Avenue, which would be completed in 1930.<br>After they were wed, the new Mr. and Mrs. Nathan Silverstein moved in with Helen&#x2019;s mother, her sisters, and a new brother-in-law at 1458 North Washtenaw. The widowed Rae Balkany was no longer running the grocery store, and instead, husband and wife Isadore and Eva Hershberg operated the store and lived with their family in one of the apartments on the second floor.<br>Sheldon Allan Silverstein, Nathan and Helen&#x2019;s first child, was born on September 25, 1930. From the time he was an infant, Shel was surrounded by people and nonstop noise, from the families living in the other apartments to the chaos on the street below outside the store to people constantly clomping up and down the stairs and knocking on the Silversteins&#x2019; door to see if the young family needed anything.<br>Helen was thirty-one years old and Nathan had just turned forty when Shel was born, and his parents&#x2019; mature years&#x2014;especially his father&#x2019;s&#x2014;profoundly influenced Shel&#x2019;s childhood. The boy had to walk on eggshells around the house and tamp down the typical manic energy of a naturally curious young child whenever his father was home. He had a surplus of energy, and even as a kid he didn&#x2019;t need much sleep, which would be true all his life.<br>The Silverstein brothers had the misfortune to open their new bakery during the first full year of the Great Depression, and the financial stress made Nathan tense and short-tempered during the few hours he spent at home each day.<br>With money so tight at the onset of the Depression, most days the Silverstein family ate whatever Nathan could bring home from the bakery, supplemented by Helen and Rae&#x2019;s creativity. (Since they were no longer running the grocery store downstairs, they couldn&#x2019;t scrounge off the shelves when things got tight anymore.) Wasting food was just about the biggest sin in the world. Nathan provided his family with day-old bread and pastries from the bakery, but of course, being a kid, Shel wanted what he couldn&#x2019;t have: the rare treats.<br>Shel&#x2019;s favorite food growing up was any creamy type of dessert, especially pudding and the custard known as junket. He was raised in a household filled with other people, where neighbors showed up unannounced for dinner because they had no food, and portion control was the rule.<br>&#x201c;I never had enough junket,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;When I was a kid, my mother used to make junket and put it into little glass dishes and put them in the refrigerator, and maybe there were six little glasses and I would get to eat one or two of them, but that was never really enough, and in my whole life I have never really had enough junket.&#x201d;<br>Shel also wanted something more than the wax lips and bubble gum that were all most kids could afford to buy during the Depression at a penny apiece.<br>&#x201c;When I was a kid and I had a box of that lousy stinking wax candy, I really wished I had enough money for a Hershey bar or a Mars bar instead,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That would really knock me out because I wanted that nickel candy, not the penny candy and baseball cards with bubble gum.&#x201d;<br>Privacy and quiet grew even more scarce after Shel&#x2019;s sister, Peggy, was born in 1934. It couldn&#x2019;t have been easy for Nathan, having another mouth to feed during the depths of the Depression. But his son began to retreat more in order to forget about the tension and strife that surrounded him. He buried himself in books, especially fantasy books, comic books, and Little Big Books that he borrowed from the library. Arthur Rackham, a Victorian British fantasy children&#x2019;s book illustrator whose paintings appear in the book The Romance of King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table, was a particular favorite, and Shel also loved stories about cowboys and Indians and others that were set during the Civil War.<br>Young Shel also listened to the radio, particularly the country-and-western stations. His favorite artist was Ernest Tubb, a pioneer of country music who was a regular on the Grand Ole Opry radio show in the 1940s. Tubb&#x2019;s first big hit, &#x201c;Walkin&#x2019; the Floor over You,&#x201d; came out in 1941.<br>&#x201c;Shel once told me that when he bought his first Ernest Tubb record, he wore it out playing it over and over again,&#x201d; said songwriter Fred Koller.<br>Shel became a student at Charles R. Darwin Elementary School in 1935 around the same time Nathan decided it was time to move his family out of his mother-in-law&#x2019;s house and into a place of their own. Unlike many businesses that had been driven into bankruptcy by the Depression, the Service Cake Company survived the worst of it, so Nathan moved his family to an apartment building at 2853 West Palmer Street.<br>Once Shel entered school, in addition to drawing constantly at home, he was bored with the subjects and started doodling in class. As much as he could, anyway, without getting rapped on the knuckles with a ruler or worse.<br>Drawing became his escape: It helped block out the constant noise from the tenants, but most important, he discovered that it also stopped the voice in his head. That voice was his father&#x2019;s, who totally disapproved of Shel&#x2019;s artistic efforts. Nathan would regularly berate Shel, calling his drawings and cartoons garbage. Nathan would say that he didn&#x2019;t puke his guts out in steerage to make it over here and then serve for a year in the war only to have his son throw his life away by drawing cartoons and daydreaming.<br>His father and mother were constantly arguing, and most of the time it was about Shel. Drawing also helped Shel to ignore his parents&#x2019; fighting.<br>&#x201c;His mother and father warred continually,&#x201d; said Judy Henske, a folksinger who met Shel in the late 1950s. &#x201c;His mother told him he could do anything he wanted while his father expected him to join the family business.&#x201d;<br>As long as he was drawing cartoons, reading books, or listening to the radio, Shel was able to keep the doubts and insecurity at bay. The moment he stopped, everything came rushing back, the negativity and noise, louder than before.<br>It was all a matter of control. While he couldn&#x2019;t control the world that existed away from his pencils and sketchpads&#x2014;including World War II, which began to ratchet up the angst in his household even more&#x2014;he could control the world in his imagination. And so he began to retreat to that world more often, away from the noise and constant conflict.<br>Once he had mastered copying Al Capp cartoons, studying them from every angle, Shel began to study the work of Virgil Partch, who went by the name of VIP, an avant-garde cartoonist popular from the 1940s through the 1960s. Partch&#x2019;s work resembles Hanna-Barbera characters like the Jetsons and the Flintstones, except he was drawing in that style at least two decades earlier. Partch drew for Walt Disney Studios for four years during the Depression, where his style was most clearly shown in the Donald Duck cartoon Duck Pimples. He came to disdain the three-fingered style common to Mickey Mouse and other symbols of the Disney empire. &#x201c;I draw a stock hand when it is doing something, such as pointing, but when the hand is hanging by some guy&#x2019;s side, those old fingers go in by the dozens,&#x201d; he once said. Shel would later follow VIP&#x2019;s example in always striving to draw a five-fingered hand.<br>Shel was in good company in studying the top cartoonists of the day, because the vast majority of them were Jewish: VIP, Stan Lee, and Shel&#x2019;s hero, Al Capp. Plus, Max Gaines had founded DC Comics, and such top comic superheroes as Superman, Batman and Robin, and Captain Marvel were created and drawn by Jewish cartoonists. Although Shel knew he only wanted to be a cartoonist and not pursue any of the other graphic arts disciplines, other Jews at the time didn&#x2019;t have a chance to break into the generally gentile fields of advertising or the fine arts, and newspaper comic strips were all but closed to them. But because comic books were a brand-new field&#x2014;and most of the publishers were Jewish&#x2014;they were the only viable avenue into the field for a kid who wanted to draw&#x2014;and who happened to be Jewish.<br>In addition to cartooning, Shel also loved baseball, specifically the Chicago White Sox. Like millions of other boys his age, Shel dreamed of playing third base for his beloved team, but he was an unathletic, gawky kid. The closest he would get to his dream was as a vendor at the baseball games, where he roamed the aisles of the bleachers to hawk peanuts and hot dogs to fans.<br>Later on, he would consider his lack of physical agility a blessing in disguise. &#x201c;If I had my choice, I would have been a great third baseman with three girls on my arm,&#x201d; said Shel. &#x201c;By the time I could get the girls, I already knew how to write poems and draw pictures. Thank God I was able to develop th...</p><h2>Kimi ni Todoke: From Me to You, Vol. 4 (4)</h2><p>Will the curse of Sadako leave her friendless for life?<br><br>R to L (Japanese Style).

Auel is one of the world's most esteemed and beloved authors. Her extensive factual research has earned her the respect of renowned scientists, archaeologists and anthropologists around the globe, culminating in her being made an Officer of the Order of Arts &amp; Letters by the French Minister of Culture and Communication in 2008.1<br><br>The band of travelers walked along the path between the clear sparkling water of Grass River and the �black-�streaked white limestone cliff, following the trail that paralleled the right bank. They went single file around the bend where the stone wall jutted out closer to the water&#x2019;s edge. Ahead a smaller path split off at an angle �toward the crossing place, where the flowing water spread out and became shallower, bubbling around exposed rocks.<br><br>Before they reached the fork in the trail a young woman near the front suddenly stopped, her eyes opening wide as she stood perfectly still, staring ahead. She pointed with her chin, not wanting to move. &#x201c;Look! Over there!&#x201d; she said in a hissing whisper of fear. &#x201c;Lions!&#x201d;<br><br>Joharran, the leader, lifted his arm, signaling the band to a halt. Just beyond the place where the trail diverged, they now saw �pale-�tawny cave lions moving around in the grass. The grass was such effective camouflage, however, that they might not have noticed them until they were much closer, if it �hadn&#x2019;t been for the sharp eyes of Thefona. The young woman from the Third Cave had exceptionally good vision, and though she was quite young, she was noted for her ability to see far and well. Her innate talent had been recognized early and they had begun training her when she was a small girl; she was their best lookout.<br><br>Near the back of the group, walking in front of three horses, Ayla and Jondalar looked up to see what was causing the delay. &#x201c;I wonder why we&#x2019;ve stopped,&#x201d; Jondalar said, a familiar frown of worry wrinkling his forehead.<br><br>Ayla observed the leader and the people around him closely, and instinctively moved her hand to shield the warm bundle that she carried in the soft leather blanket tied to her chest. Jonayla had recently nursed and was sleeping, but moved slightly at her mother&#x2019;s touch. Ayla had an uncanny ability to interpret meaning from body language, learned young when she lived with the Clan. She knew Joharran was alarmed and Thefona was frightened.<br><br>Ayla, too, had extraordinarily sharp vision. She could also pick up sounds above the range of normal hearing and feel the deep tones of those that were below. Her sense of smell and taste were also keen, but she had never compared herself with anyone, and �didn&#x2019;t realize how extraordinary her perceptions were. She was born with heightened acuity in all her senses, which no doubt contributed to her survival after losing her parents and everything she knew at five years. Her only training had come from herself. She had developed her natural abilities during the years she studied animals, chiefly carnivores, when she was teaching herself to hunt.<br><br>In the stillness, she discerned the faint but familiar rumblings of lions, detected their distinctive scent on a slight breeze, and noticed that several people in front of the group were gazing ahead. When she looked, she saw something move. Suddenly the cats hidden by the grass seemed to jump into clear focus. She could make out two young and three or four adult cave lions. As she started moving forward, she reached with one hand for her �spear-�thrower, fastened to a carrying loop on her belt, and with the other for a spear from the holder hanging on her back.<br><br>&#x201c;Where are you going?&#x201d; Jondalar asked.<br><br>She stopped. &#x201c;There are lions up ahead just beyond the split in the trail,&#x201d; she said under her breath.<br><br>Jondalar turned to look, and noticed movement that he interpreted as lions now that he knew what to look for. He reached for his weapons as well. &#x201c;You should stay here with Jonayla. I&#x2019;ll go.&#x201d;<br><br>Ayla glanced down at her sleeping baby, then looked up at him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re good with the �spear-�thrower, Jondalar, but there are at least two cubs and three grown lions, probably more. If the lions think the cubs are in danger and decide to attack, you&#x2019;ll need help, someone to back you up, and you know I&#x2019;m better than anyone, except you.&#x201d;<br><br>His brow furrowed again as he paused to think, looking at her. Then he nodded. &#x201c;All right . . . but stay behind me.&#x201d; He detected movement out of the corner of his eye and glanced back. &#x201c;What about the horses?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They know lions are near. Look at them,&#x201d; Ayla said.<br><br>Jondalar looked. All three horses, including the new young filly, were staring ahead, obviously aware of the huge felines. Jondalar frowned again. &#x201c;Will they be all right? Especially little Gray?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They know to stay out of the way of those lions, but I don&#x2019;t see Wolf,&#x201d; Ayla said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better whistle for him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to,&#x201d; Jondalar said, pointing in a different direction. &#x201c;He must sense something, too. Look at him coming.&#x201d;<br><br>Ayla turned and saw a wolf racing �toward her. The canine was a magnificent animal, larger than most, but an injury from a fight with other wolves that left him with a bent ear gave him a rakish look. She made the special signal that she used when they hunted together. He knew it meant to stay near and pay close attention to her. They ducked around people as they hurried �toward the front, trying not to cause any undo commotion, and to remain as inconspicuous as possible.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; Joharran said softly when he saw his brother and Ayla with the wolf quietly appear with their �spear-�throwers in hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know how many there are?&#x201d; Ayla asked.<br><br>&#x201c;More than I thought,&#x201d; Thefona said, trying to seem calm and not let her fear show. &#x201c;When I first saw them, I thought there were maybe three or four, but they are moving around in the grass, and now I think there may be ten or more. It&#x2019;s a big pride.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And they are feeling confident,&#x201d; Joharran said.<br><br>&#x201c;How do you know that?&#x201d; Thefona asked.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re ignoring us.&#x201d;<br><br>Jondalar knew his mate was very familiar with the huge felines. &#x201c;Ayla knows cave lions,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Perhaps we should ask her what she thinks.&#x201d; Joharran nodded in her direction, asking the question silently.<br><br>&#x201c;Joharran is right. They know we&#x2019;re here. And they know how many they are and how many we are,&#x201d; Ayla said, then added, &#x201c;They may see us as something like a herd of horses or aurochs and think they may be able to single out a weak one. I think they are new to this region.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What makes you think so?&#x201d; Joharran said. He was always surprised at Ayla&#x2019;s wealth of knowledge of �four-�legged hunters, but for some reason it was also at times like this that he noticed her unusual accent more.<br><br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t know us, that&#x2019;s why they&#x2019;re so confident,&#x201d; Ayla continued. &#x201c;If they were a resident pride that lived around people and had been chased or hunted a few times, I don&#x2019;t think they would be so unconcerned.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, maybe we should give them something to be concerned about,&#x201d; Jondalar said.<br><br>Joharran&#x2019;s brow wrinkled in a way that was so much like his taller though younger brother&#x2019;s, it made Ayla want to smile, but it usually showed at a time when smiling would be inappropriate. &#x201c;Perhaps it would be wiser just to avoid them,&#x201d; the �dark-�haired leader said.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; Ayla said, bowing her head and looking down. It was still difficult for her to disagree with a man in public, especially a leader. Though she knew it was perfectly acceptable among the Zelandonii&#x2014;after all, some leaders were women, including, at one time, Joharran and Jondalar&#x2019;s mother&#x2014;such behavior from a woman would not have been tolerated in the Clan, the ones who raised her.<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Joharran asked, his frown turning into a scowl.<br><br>&#x201c;Those lions are resting too close to the home of the Third Cave,&#x201d; Ayla said quietly. &#x201c;There will always be lions around, but if they are comfortable here, they might think of it as a place to return when they want to rest, and would see any people who come near as prey, especially children or elders. They could be a danger to the people who live at Two Rivers Rock, and the other nearby Caves, including the Ninth.&#x201d;<br><br>Joharran took a deep breath, then looked at his �fair-�haired brother. &#x201c;Your mate is right, and you as well, Jondalar. Perhaps now is the time to let those lions know they are not welcome to settle down so close to our homes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This would be a good time to use �spear-�throwers so we can hunt from a safer distance. Several hunters here have been practicing,&#x201d; Jondalar said. It was for just this sort of thing that he had wanted to come home and show everyone the weapon he had developed. &#x201c;We may not even have to kill one, just injure a couple to teach them to stay away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jondalar,&#x201d; Ayla said, softly. Now she was getting ready to differ with him, or at least to make a point that he should consider. She looked down again, then raised her eyes and looked directly at him. She �wasn&#x2019;t afraid to speak her mind to him, but she wanted to be respectful. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s true that a �spear-�thrower is a very good weapon. With it, a spear can be thrown from a much greater distance than one thrown by hand, and that makes it safer. But safer is not safe. A wounded animal is unpredictable. And one with the strength and speed of a cave lion, hurt and wild with pain, could do anything. If you decide to use these weapons against those lions, they should not be used to injure, but to kill.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s right, Jondalar,&#x201d; Joharran said.<br><br>Jondalar frowned at his brother, then grinned sheepishly. &#x201c;Yes she is, but, as dangerous as they are, I always hate to kill a cave lion if I don&#x2019;t have to. They are so beautiful, so lithe and graceful in the way they move. Cave lions don&#x2019;t have much to be afraid of. Their strength gives them confidence.&#x201d; He glanced at Ayla with a glint of pride and love. &#x201c;I always thought Ayla&#x2019;s Cave Lion totem was right for her.&#x201d; Discomfited by showing his strong inner feelings for her, a hint of a flush colored his cheeks. &#x201c;But I do think this is a time when �spear-�throwers could be very useful.&#x201d;<br><br>Joharran noticed that most of the travelers had crowded closer. &#x201c;How many are with us that can use one?&#x201d; he asked his brother.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, there&#x2019;s you, and me, and Ayla, of course,&#x201d; Jondalar said, looking at the group. &#x201c;Rushemar has been practicing a lot and is getting pretty good. Solaban&#x2019;s been busy making some ivory handles for tools for some of us and hasn&#x2019;t been working at it as much, but he&#x2019;s got the basics.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve tried a �spear-�thrower a few times, Joharran. I don&#x2019;t have one of my own, and I&#x2019;m not very good at it,&#x201d; Thefona said, &#x201c;but I can throw a spear without one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Thefona, for reminding me,&#x201d; Joharran said. &#x201c;Nearly everyone can handle a spear without a �spear-�thrower, including women. We �shouldn&#x2019;t forget that.&#x201d; Then he directed his comments to the group at large. &#x201c;We need to let those lions know that this is not a good place for them. Whoever wants to go after them, using a spear by hand or with the thrower, come over here.&#x201d;<br><br>Ayla started to loosen her baby&#x2019;s carrying blanket. &#x201c;Folara, would you watch Jonayla for me?&#x201d; she said, approaching Jondalar&#x2019;s younger sister, &#x201c;unless you&#x2019;d rather stay and hunt cave lions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve gone out on drives, but I never was very good with a spear, and I don&#x2019;t seem to be much better with the thrower,&#x201d; Folara said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take Jonayla.&#x201d; The infant was now thoroughly awake, and when the young woman held out her arms for the baby, she willingly went to her aunt.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll help her,&#x201d; Proleva said to Ayla. Joharran&#x2019;s mate also had a baby girl in a carrying blanket, just a few days older than Jonayla, and an active boy who could count six years to watch out for as well. &#x201c;I think we should take all the children away from here, perhaps back behind the jutting rock, or up to the Third Cave.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a very good idea,&#x201d; Joharran said. &#x201c;Hunters stay here. The rest of you go back, but go slowly. No sudden moves. We want those cave lions to think we are just milling around, like a herd of aurochs. And when we pair off, each group keep together. They will probably go after anyone alone.&#x201d;<br><br>Ayla turned back �toward the �four-�legged hunters and saw many lion faces looking in their direction, very alert. She watched the animals move around, and began to see some distinguishing characteristics, helping her to count them. She watched a big female casually turn around&#x2014;no, a male, she realized when she saw his male parts from the backside. She&#x2019;d forgotten for a moment that the males here �didn&#x2019;t have manes. The male cave lions near her valley to the east, including one that she knew quite well, did have some hair around the head and neck, but it was sparse. This is a big pride, she thought, more than two handsful of counting words, possibly as many as three, including the young ones.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Pearl&#39;s Kitchen: An Extraordinary Cookbook</h2><p>One hundred of Pearl Bailey&#39;s favorite recipes are interspersed with personal anecdotes and views on child-rearing, entertaining, and housekeeping</p><p></p><h2>Prophets and Personal Prophecy (Volume 1)</h2><p>Prophets and Personal Prophecy (Volume 1)</p><p>This book defines the role of a prophet or prophetess and gives the reader strategic guidelines for judging prophecy.

The novel&#39;s greatest appeal and achievement, however, is not sociological, but psychological. As noted in the editor&#39;s comprehensive introduction, Larsen takes the them of psychic dualism, so popular in Harlem Renaissance fiction, to a higher and more complex level, displaying a sophisticated understanding and penetrating analysis of black female psychology.Nella Larsen was born in Chicago in 1893 of a Danish mother and a West Indian father. She began writing during the Harlem Renaissance, a period during which black artists, writers, and musicians were prominent in the New York art scene. The success of Quicksand and Passing made Nella Larsen one of the most feted woman writers of her generation. She died in 1963 in obscurity. Now her &#39;lost&#39; work is being rediscovered and celebrated.</p><h2>An Interrupted Life: The Diaries of Etty Hillesum 1941-43</h2><p>Etty Hillesum&#39;s diary gives us the portrait of this extraordinary woman.

Sayers was an English writer, translator, and Christian humanist. Best known for the extremely popular Lord Peter Wimsey mystery series, Sayers also penned a number of plays, including The Man Born to Be King, essays, and translations, of which she considered Dante s Divine Comedy to be her best. Sayers died in 1950, and is buried in St. Anne s Church in London.Ian Carmichael personified Lord Peter Wimsey for a generation of public television viewers. His affection for the brainy, finicky, aristocratic detective is clear in this reading. In addition to creating a well-drawn Wimsey, he imbues solid Bunter with the humor and patience that Sayers blended into his personality. All the other characters in this tale of countryside bell ringing gone wrong are so perfectly vivid that listeners may find themselves chortling with pleasure as they listen. The only quibble is that Carmichael's reading voice is the same as the one he gives to Lord Peter, leading to some confusion between the narrative and the dialogue spoken by Wimsey.

The next he&#39;s a helpless stranger on Earth during the heyday of the first Galactic Empire. Earth, as he soon learns, is a backwater, just a pebble in the sky, despised by all the other 200 million planets of the Empire because its people dare to claim it&#39;s the original home of man. And Earth is poor, with great areas of radioactivity ruining much of its soil--so poor that everyone is sentenced to death at the age of sixty. Joseph Schwartz is sixty-two. This is young Isaac Asimov&#39;s first novel, full of wonders and ideas, the book that launched the novels of the Galactic Empire, culminating in the Foundation series. This is Golden Age SF at its finest.</p><p>Isaac Asimov was born in 1920 in the Soviet Union. His family came to the United States in 1923. He earned his Ph.D in Chemistry in 1948 and in 1958, he became a full&#x2013;time writer. His writings include: <i>In Memory Yet Green, I, Asimov: A Memoir, Yours, Isaac Asimov</i>, and <i>It's Been A Good Life</i>, as well as three Opus books. He died in 1992.<p>Chapter 1<br>Two minutes before he disappeared forever from the face of the Earth he knew, Joseph Schwartz strolled along the pleasant streets of suburban Chicago quoting Browning to himself.<br>In a sense this was strange, since Schwartz would scarcely have impressed any casual passerby as the Browning-quoting type. He looked exactly what he was: a retired tailor, thoroughly lacking in what the sophisticates of today call a &#x201c;formal education.&#x201d; Yet he had expended much of an inquisitive nature upon random reading. By the sheer force of indiscriminate voracity, he had gleaned a smattering of practically everything, and by means of a trick memory had managed to keep it all straight.<br>For instance, he had read Robert Browning&#x2019;s Rabbi Ben Ezra twice when he was younger, so, of course, knew it by heart. Most of it was obscure to him, but those first three lines had become one with the beating of his heart these last few years. He intoned them to himself, deep within the silent fortress of his mind, that very sunny and very bright early summer day of 1949:<br>&#x201c;Grow old along with me!<br>The best is yet to be,<br>The last of life, for which the first was made...&#x201d;<br>Schwartz felt that to its fullness. After the struggles of youth in Europe and those of his early manhood in the United States, the serenity of a comfortable old age was pleasant. With a house of his own and money of his own, he could, and did, retire. With a wife in good health, two daughters safely married, a grandson to soothe these last best years, what had he to worry about?<br>There was the atom bomb, of course, and this somewhat lascivious talk about World War III, but Schwartz was a believer in the goodness of human nature. He didn&#x2019;t think there would be another war. He didn&#x2019;t think Earth would ever see again the sunlike hell of an atom exploded in anger. So he smiled tolerantly at the children he passed and silently wished them a speedy and not too difficult ride through youth to the peace of the best that was yet to be.<br>He lifted his foot to step over a Raggedy Ann doll smiling through its neglect as it lay there in the middle of the walk, a foundling not yet missed. He had not quite put his foot down again... In another part of Chicago stood the Institute for Nuclear Research, in which men may have had theories upon the essential worth of human nature but were half ashamed of them, since no quantitative instrument had yet been designed to measure it. When they thought about it, it was often enough to wish that some stroke from heaven would prevent human nature (and damned human ingenuity) from turning every innocent and interesting discovery into a deadly weapon.<br>Yet, in a pinch, the same man who could not find it in his conscience to curb his curiosity into the nuclear studies that might someday kill half of Earth would risk his life to save that of an unimportant fellow man.<br>It was the blue glow behind the chemist&#x2019;s back that first attracted the attention of Dr. Smith.<br>He peered at it as he passed the half-open door. The chemist, a cheerful youngster, was whistling as he tipped up a volumetric flask, in which the solution had already been made up to volume. A white powder tumbled lazily through the liquid, dissolving in its own good time. For a moment that was all, and then Dr. Smith&#x2019;s instinct, which had stopped him in the first place, stirred him to action.<br>He dashed inside, snatched up a yardstick, and swept the contents of the desk top to the floor. There was the deadly hiss of molten metal. Dr. Smith felt a drop of perspiration slip to the end of his nose.<br>The youngster stared blankly at the concrete floor along which the silvery metal had already frozen in thin splash marks. They still radiated heat strongly.<br>He said faintly, &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br>Dr. Smith shrugged. He wasn&#x2019;t quite himself either. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. You tell me.... What&#x2019;s been doing here?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s been doing here,&#x201d; the chemist yammered. &#x201c;That was just a sample of crude uranium. I&#x2019;m making an electrolytic copper determination.... I don&#x2019;t know what could have happened.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Whatever happened, young man, I can tell you what I saw. That platinum crucible was showing a corona. Heavy radiation was taking place. Uranium, you say?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, but crude uranium, and that isn&#x2019;t dangerous. I mean, extreme purity is one of the most important qualifications for fission, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; He touched his tongue to his lips quickly. &#x201c;Do you think it was fission, sir? It&#x2019;s not plutonium, and it wasn&#x2019;t being bombarded.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And,&#x201d; said Dr. Smith thoughtfully, &#x201c;it was below the critical mass. Or, at least, below the critical masses we think we know.&#x201d; He stared at the soapstone desk, at the burned and blistered paint of the cabinets and the silvery streaks along the concrete floor. &#x201c;Yet uranium melts at about 1800 degrees Centigrade, and nuclear phenomena are not so well known that we can afford to talk too glibly. After all, this place must be fairly saturated with stray radiations. When the metal cools, young man, it had better be chipped up, collected, and thoroughly analyzed.&#x201d;<br>He gazed thoughtfully about him, then stepped to the opposite wall and felt uneasily at a spot about shoulder height.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; he said to the chemist. &#x201c;Has this always been here?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What, sir?&#x201d; The young man stepped up nervously and glanced at the spot the older man indicated. It was a tiny hole, one that might have been made by a thin nail driven into the wall and withdrawn&#x2014;but driven through plaster and brick for the full thickness of the building&#x2019;s wall, since daylight could be seen through it.<br>The chemist shook his head, &#x201c;I never saw that before. But I never looked for it, either, sir.&#x201d;<br>Dr. Smith said nothing. He stepped back slowly and passed the thermostat, a parallelopiped of a box made out of thin sheet iron. The water in it moved swirlingly as the stirrer turned in motor-driven monomania, while the electric bulbs beneath the water, serving as heaters, flicked on and off distractingly, in time with the clicking of the mercury relay.<br>&#x201c;Well, then, was this here?&#x201d; And Dr. Smith scraped gently with his fingernail at a spot near the top of the wide side of the thermostat. It was a neat, tiny circle drilled through the metal. The water did not quite reach it.<br>The chemist&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;No, sir, that wasn&#x2019;t there ever before. I&#x2019;ll guarantee that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hmm. Is there one on the other side?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll be damned. I mean, yes, sir!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right, come round here and sight through the holes.... Shut the thermostat off, please. Now stay there.&#x201d; He placed his finger on the hole in the wall. &#x201c;What do you see?&#x201d; he called out.<br>&#x201c;I see your finger, sir. Is that where the hole is?&#x201d;<br>Dr. Smith did not answer. He said, with a calmness he was far from feeling, &#x201c;Sight through in the other direction.... Now what do you see?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nothing now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s the place where the crucible with the uranium was standing. You&#x2019;re looking at the exact place, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>Reluctantly, &#x201c;I think so, sir.&#x201d;&lt;</p></p><h2>Arizona Gardener&#39;s Guide (Gardener&#39;s Guides)</h2><p><p>Gardening is now the favorite outdoor leisure activity in America.

Pegasus Bridge was the first engagement of D-Day, the turning point of World War II. This gripping account of it by acclaimed author Stephen Ambrose brings to life a daring mission so crucial that, had it been unsuccessful, the entire Normandy invasion might have failed.</p><h2>The Map and the Territory</h2><p>The most celebrated and controversial French novelist of our time now delivers his magnum opus&#x2014;about art and money, love and friendship and death, fathers and sons.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Map and the Territory</i> is the story of an artist, Jed Martin, and his family and lovers and friends, the arc of his entire history rendered with sharp humor and powerful compassion. His earliest photographs, of countless industrial objects, were followed by a surprisingly successful series featuring Michelin road maps, which also happened to bring him the love of his life, Olga, a beautiful Russian working&#x2014;for a time&#x2014;in Paris. But global fame and fortune arrive when he turns to painting and produces a host of portraits that capture a wide range of professions, from the commonplace (the owner of a local bar) to the autobiographical (his father, an accomplished architect) and from the celebrated (<i>Bill Gates and Steve Jobs Discussing the Future of Information Technology</i>) to the literary (a writer named Houellebecq, with whom he develops an unusually close relationship). <br> &nbsp;<br> Then, while his aging father (his only living relative) flirts with oblivion, a police inspector seeks Martin&#x2019;s help in solving an unspeakably gruesome crime&#x2014;events that prove profoundly unsettling. Even so, now growing old himself, Jed Martin somehow discovers serenity and manages to add another startling chapter to his artistic legacy, a deeply moving conclusion to this saga of hopes and losses and dreams.</p><p>Already honored with the Prix Novembre and the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, <b>Michel Houellebecq</b> won the Prix Goncourt for <i>The Map and the Territory</i> in 2010.Jeff Koons had just got up from his chair, enthusiastically throwing his arms out in front of him. Sitting opposite him, slightly hunched up, on a white leather sofa partly draped with silks, Damien Hirst seemed to be about to express an objection; his face was flushed, morose. Both of them were wearing black suits&#x2014;Koons&#x2019;s had fine pinstripes&#x2014;and white shirts and black ties. Between them, on the coffee table, was a basket of candied fruits that neither paid any attention to. Hirst was drinking a Bud Light.<br> &nbsp;<br> Behind them, a bay window opened onto a landscape of tall buildings that formed a Babylonian tangle of gigantic polygons that stretched across the horizon. The night was bright, the air absolutely clear. They could have been in Qatar, or Dubai; the decoration of the room was, in reality, inspired by an advertisement photograph, taken from a German luxury publication, of the Emirates Palace Hotel in Abu Dhabi.<br> &nbsp;<br> Koons&#x2019;s forehead was slightly shiny. Jed shaded it with his brush and stepped back three paces. There was certainly a problem with Koons. Hirst was basically easy to capture: you could make him brutal, cynical in an &#x201c;I shit on you from the top of my pile of cash&#x201d; kind of way; you could also make him a <i>rebel</i> <i>artist</i> (but rich all the same) pursuing an <i>anguished</i> <i>work</i> <i>on</i> <i>death</i>; finally, there was in his face something ruddy and heavy, typically English, which made him look like a rank-and-file Arsenal supporter. In short, there were various aspects to him, but all of them could be combined into a coherent, representative portrait of a British artist typical of his generation. Koons, on the other hand, seemed to have a duality, an insurmountable contradiction between the basic cunning of the technical sales rep and the exaltation of the ascetic. It was already three weeks now that Jed had been retouching Koons&#x2019;s expression as he stood up from his chair, throwing out his arms as if he were trying to convince Hirst of something. It was as difficult as painting a Mormon pornographer.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had photographs of Koons on his own, in the company of Roman Abramovich, Madonna, Barack Obama, Bono, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates... Not one of them managed to express anything of the personality of Koons, to go beyond the appearance of a Chevrolet convertible salesman that he had decided to display to the world, and this was exasperating. In fact, for a long time photographers had exasperated Jed, especially the <i>great</i> <i>photographers,</i> with their claim to reveal in their snapshots the <i>truth</i> of their models. They didn&#x2019;t reveal anything at all, just placed themselves in front of you and switched on the motor of their camera to take hundreds of random snapshots while chuckling, and later chose the least bad of the lot; that&#x2019;s how they proceeded, without exception, all those so-called <i>great</i> <i>photographers.</i> Jed knew some of them personally and had nothing but contempt for them; he considered them all about as creative as a Photomaton.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the kitchen, a few steps behind him, the boiler uttered a succession of loud banging noises. It went rigid, paralyzed. It was already 15 December.<br> &nbsp;<br> One year before, on almost the same date, his boiler had uttered the same succession of banging noises before stopping completely. In a few hours, the temperature in the studio had fallen to thirty-seven degrees. He had managed to sleep a little, or rather doze off, for brief periods. Around six in the morning, he had emptied the hot-water tank to wash himself quickly, then had brewed coffee while waiting for the man from Plumbing in General, who had promised to send someone in the early hours of the morning.<br> &nbsp;<br> On its Web site, Plumbing in General offered to &#x201c;make plumbing enter the third millennium&#x201d;; they could at least start by turning up on time, grumbled Jed at about eleven, pacing around his studio in a vain attempt to warm himself up. He was then working on a painting of his father, which he was going to entitle <i>The</i> <i>Architect</i> <i>Jean-Pierre Martin Leaving the Management of His Business;</i> inevitably, the drop in temperature meant that the last layer of paint would take an age to dry. He had agreed, as he did every year, to dine with his father on Christmas Eve, two weeks hence, and hoped to have finished it by then; if a plumber didn&#x2019;t intervene quickly, his plan risked being compromised. To tell the truth, in absolute terms, it wasn&#x2019;t that important: he didn&#x2019;t intend to offer this painting to his father as a gift; he wanted simply to <i>show</i> it to him. Why, then, was he suddenly attaching so much importance to it? He was at the end of his tether; he was working too hard, had started six paintings simultaneously. For a few months he hadn&#x2019;t stopped. It wasn&#x2019;t sensible.<br> &nbsp;<br> At around three in the afternoon, he decided to call Plumbing in General again, but the line was constantly engaged. He managed to get through to them just after five, when the customer-service secretary explained that there had been an exceptional workload due to the frigid weather, but promised that someone would certainly come the following morning. Jed hung up, then reserved a room in the Mercure Hotel on the boulevard Auguste-Blanqui.<br> &nbsp;<br> He waited all of the following day for the arrival of Plumbing in General, but also for Simply Plumbers, whom he had managed to contact in the meantime. While Simply Plumbers promised to respect the craft traditions of &#x201c;higher plumbing,&#x201d; they showed themselves to be no more capable of turning up on time.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the painting he had made of him, Jed&#x2019;s father, standing on a podium in the middle of the group of about fifty employees that made up his business, was lifting his glass with a sorrowful smile. The farewell party took place in the open space of his architectural practice, a large room thirty meters by twenty with white walls and a skylight, under which computer design posts alternated with trestle tables carrying the scale models of current projects. Most of those present were nerdy-looking young people&#x2014;the 3-D designers. Standing at the foot of the podium, three fortysomething architects surrounded his father. In accordance with a configuration borrowed from a minor painting by Lorenzo Lotto, each of them avoided the eyes of the others, while trying to catch those of his father; each of them, you understood right away, nurtured the hope of succeeding him as the head of the business. His father&#x2019;s eyes, staring just above those present, expressed the desire to gather his team around him for one last time, and a reasonable confidence in the future, but also an absolute sadness. Sadness at leaving the business he had founded, to which he had given all his strength, and sadness at the inevitable: you were quite obviously dealing with a finished man.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the middle of the afternoon, Jed tried in vain, a dozen times, to get through to Ze Plumb, who used Skyrock Radio as its hold music, while Simply Plumbing had opted for the radio station Laughter and Songs.<br> &nbsp;<br> At about five, he returned to the Mercure Hotel. Night was falling on the boulevard Auguste-Blanqui; some homeless people had lit a fire on one side of the street.<br> &nbsp;<br> The subsequent days passed more or less in the same way: dialing numbers of plumbing businesses, being redirected almost instantaneously to on-hold music, waiting, as it got colder and colder, next to his painting, which refused to dry.<br> &nbsp;<br> A solution came on the morning of 24 December, in the form of a Croatian workman who lived nearby on the avenue Stephen-Pichon; Jed had noticed his sign by accident while returning from the Mercure Hotel. He was available, yes, immediately. He was a small man with black hair and a pale complexion, harmonious and fine features, and a rather Belle �poque mustache; in fact, he looked a bit like Jed&#x2014;apart from the mustache.<br> &nbsp;<br> Immediately after entering the flat, he examined the boiler for a long time, dismantling the control panel, running his slender fingers along the complex trail of pipes. He spoke of valves and siphons. He gave the impression of knowing a lot about life in general.<br> &nbsp;<br> After a quarter of an hour, his diagnosis was the following: he could repair, yes, he could do <i>a</i> <i>sort</i> <i>of</i> <i>repair</i> that would come to fifty euros, no more. But it would be less than a genuine repair job, only a makeshift one, really, that would do the trick for a few months, even a few years in the best-case scenario, but he refused to give any long-term guarantee; more generally, it was unseemly to make a long-term bet on this boiler.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jed sighed and confessed he had half expected it. He remembered very well the day when he had decided to buy this flat; he could still see the estate agent, stocky and self-satisfied, boasting of the exceptional light, but not hiding the need for certain &#x201c;improvements.&#x201d; He had then told himself that he should have become an estate agent, or a gynecologist.<br> &nbsp;<br> Barely amiable in the first few minutes, the stocky estate agent went into a lyrical trance when he learned that Jed was an artist. It was the first time, he exclaimed, that he&#x2019;d had the opportunity to sell an <i>artist&#x2019;s studio</i> to an <i>artist</i>! Jed feared for a moment that he would declare his solidarity with authentic artists against the bourgeois bohemians and other such philistines who inflated prices, thus making artist&#x2019;s studios inaccessible to artists, but what can you do? I can&#x2019;t go against the truth of the market: it&#x2019;s not my role. But fortunately this did not happen. The stocky estate agent just offered him a ten percent discount&#x2014;which he had probably already foreseen offering after a mini-negotiation.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Artist&#x2019;s studio&#x201d; really meant an attic with a skylight&#x2014;a very nice one, it must be said&#x2014;and a few dark adjoining spaces, scarcely insufficient for someone like Jed, who had very limited hygienic needs. But the view was, indeed, splendid: beyond the place des Alpes it extended as far as the boulevard Vincent-Auriol and the aboveground M�tro, and farther on to those quadrangular buildings built in the mid-seventies that were in complete opposition to the rest of the Parisian aesthetic landscape, and which were what Jed preferred in Paris, by far, in terms of architecture.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Croat did the repair job and pocketed the fifty euros. He didn&#x2019;t offer an invoice, and Jed hadn&#x2019;t expected one. The door had just closed behind him when he knocked again very gently. Jed opened the door slightly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;By the way, monsieur,&#x201d; said the man. &#x201c;Merry Christmas. I wanted to say to you: Merry Christmas.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;d forgotten,&#x201d; said Jed, embarrassed. &#x201c;Merry Christmas to you too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was then that he became aware of the problem of the taxi. As expected, ToAnywhere refused point-blank to drive him to Le Raincy, and Speedtax agreed to take him to the railway station, or, at a pinch, as far as the town hall, but certainly not near the Cicadas housing complex. &#x201c;Security reasons, monsieur,&#x201d; whispered the employee with a slight reproach in his voice. &#x201c;We only serve completely safe zones, monsieur,&#x201d; said the receptionist for Fernand Garcin Cars with smooth self-importance. Jed felt more and more guilty about wanting to spend Christmas Eve in such an incongruous place and, as happened every year, began to get angry with his father, who obstinately refused to quit that bourgeois house, surrounded by a vast park, that population movements had gradually relegated to the heart of a zone that got ever more dangerous, and which had recently fallen under the complete control of gangs.<br> &nbsp;<br> First, the perimeter wall had needed to be reinforced and topped with an electrified fence, then a CCTV system linked to the police station was installed, all so his father could wander alone in twelve rooms that were impossible to heat and where no one came except Jed, every Christmas Eve. The nearby shops had long since closed, and it was impossible to walk around the neighboring streets, since even attacks on cars stopped at traffic lights were not unheard of. The Raincy Council had given him a home-care aide&#x2014;a cantankerous and nasty Senegalese woman called Fatty who had disliked him from the start, refused to change the sheets more than once a month, and most probably stole from the shopping allowance.<br> &nbsp;<br> Be that as it may, the temperature was rising slowly in the room. Jed took a photo of the painting in progress, which would at least give him something to show his father. He took off his trousers and his pullover, sat down cross-legged on the narrow mattress on the floor that served as his bed, and wrapped himself in a blanket. Gradually, he slowed the rhythm of his breathing. He visualized waves rolling slowly, lazily, beneath a matte twilight. He tried to lead his mind to a place of calm, and prepare himself as best he could for another Christmas Eve with his father.<br> &nbsp;<br> This mental preparation bore fruit, and the following evening was a zone of neutral time, even semi-convivial; he had hoped for nothing more.<br> &nbsp;<br> The next morning, at about seven, assuming that the gangs too had <i>celebrated</i> <i>Christmas,</i> Jed walked to Raincy Station and got back to the Gare de l&#x2019;Est without a hitch.<br> &nbsp;<br> One year on, the boiler repair had held, and this was the first time that it had shown signs of weakness. <i>The</i> <i>Architect</i> <i>Jean-Pierre Martin Leaving the Management of His Business</i> had been finished for some time and put into storage by Jed&#x2019;s gallerist in anticipation of a solo exhibition that was taking a while to organize. Jean-Pierre Martin himself&#x2014;to the surprise of his son, who had long since given up talking to him about it&#x2014;had decided to leave the house in Le Raincy and move into a nursing home in Boulogne. Their annual meal would this time take place in a brasserie on the avenue Bosquet called Chez Papa. Jed had chosen it on the strength of an ad in <i>Pariscope</i> promising traditional quality, <i>� l&#x2019;ancienne,</i> and this promise was, on the whole, kept. Some Father Christmases and trees decorated with tinsel sprinkled the half-empty room, essentially occupied by small groups of old people, some very old, who chewed carefully, consciously, and even ferociously on dishes of traditional cuisine. There were wild boar, suckling pig, and turkey; for dessert, of course, a patisserie Yule log <i>� l&#x2019;ancienne</i> was proposed by the house, whose polite and discreet waiters operated in silence, as if in a burn unit. Jed had been a bit stupid, he realized, to offer his father such a meal. This dry, serious man, with a long and austere face, never seemed to have been taken by the pleasures of the table, and the rare times Jed had dined out with him, when he had needed to see him near his place of work, his father had chosen a sushi restaurant&#x2014;always the same one. It was pathetic and vain to want to establish a gastronomical conviviality that had no raison d&#x2019;�tre, and which had not even conceivably ever had one&#x2014;his mother, while she was alive, had always hated cooking. But it was Christmas, and what else could you do?

As Peter Theroux in the New York Times Book Review points out, &#34;Her wonderfully witty voice and her penchant for history lessons of the Nile both ancient and modern keep (her) high adventure moving for even the highest brows&#34;. In her previous outing, The Last Camel Died at Noon, Amelia Peabody and her dashing husband, Emerson, discovered a fabulous lost oasis in the Nubian desert. Now, in the seventh mystery in the series, the Emerson-Peabodys are traveling up the Nile once again to encounter their most deadly adversary, the Master Criminal, who is back at his sinister best. Amelia Peabody was unabashedly proud of her newest translation, a fragment of the ancient fairytale &#34;The Doomed Prince&#34;. Later, she would wonder why no sense of foreboding struck her as she retold the story of the king&#39;s favorite son who had been warned that he would die from the snake, the crocodile, or the dog. Little did she realize, as she and her beloved husband sailed blissfully toward the pyramids of ancient Egypt, that those very beasts (and a cat as well) would be part of a deadly plot. The expedition began so happily....Leaving their delightful, but catastrophically precocious, son, Ramses, back in England, Amelia hoped this romantic trip might rejuvenate her thirteen-year-old marriage and bring back the thrills that she feared were fading. She and her dear Emerson were returning to the remote desert site where they had first fallen in love, Amarna, the holy city of Akhenaton and his beautiful queen, Nefertiti. But their return would threaten not only their marriage, but their very lives with perils as chilling as a mummy&#39;scurse. An old enemy was determined to learn Amelia and Emerson&#39;s most closely guarded secret: the location of a legendary long-lost oasis and a race of people bedecked in gold.

These circumstances, amid rumors of a lost oasis rich in treasure, lead before long to Emerson's kidnapping; his rescue by indomitable Amelia and ever-faithful Abdullah; and Emerson's post-rescue amnesia. None of this halts the explorations at a tomb that Amelia hopes will turn out to be that of Nefertiti. Much help is provided by philanthropist-amateur archaeologist Cyrus Vandergelt, an American somewhat smitten with Amelia. But enemies old and new abound--ambushes, attacks, and villains in disguise proliferate in exasperating confusion--until the inevitable happy ending and the defeat of all foes, including the equally inevitable Master Criminal. Bloated plot, excessive verbiage and all--but there's still fun to be had for Amelia's fans and lovers of Egyptology in the seventh of this series.

Folded into this small package are compact views on resourcefulness, momentum, cunning, the profit motive, flexibility, integrity, secrecy, speed, positioning, surprise, deception, manipulation, responsibility, and practicality. Thomas Cleary's translation keeps the package tight, with crisp language and short sections. Commentaries from the Chinese tradition trail Sun-tzu's words, elaborating and picking up on puzzling lines. Take the solitary passage: "Do not eat food for their soldiers." Elsewhere, Sun-tzu has told us to plunder the enemy's stores, but now we're not supposed to eat the food? The Tang dynasty commentator Du Mu solves the puzzle nicely, "If the enemy suddenly abandons their food supplies, they should be tested first before eating, lest they be poisoned." Most passages, however, are the pinnacle of succinct clarity: "Lure them in with the prospect of gain, take them by confusion" or "Invincibility is in oneself, vulnerability is in the opponent." Sun-tzu's maxims are widely applicable beyond the military because they speak directly to the exigencies of survival. Your new tools will serve you well, but don't flaunt them. Remember Sun-tzu's advice: "Though effective, appear to be ineffective." <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Here is a seminal work on the philosophy of successful leadership that is as applicable to contemporary business as it is to war.

In the transition of Mexican fiction from direct statements of nationalism and social protest to a concentration on cosmopolitanism, the works of Rulfo hold a unique position. These stories of a rural people caught in the play of natural forces are not simply an interior examination of the phenomena of their world; they are written for the larger purpose of showing the actions of humans in broad terms of reality.</p></p><p>"Juan Rulfo's fifteen tales of rural folk prove him to be one of the master storytellers of modern Mexico....

Whether he was profiling the rich and famous or creating indelible word-pictures of events and places near and far, Capote&#x2019;s eye for detail and dazzling style made his reportage and commentary undeniable triumphs of the form. <br><br><i>Portraits and Observations</i> is the first volume devoted solely to all the essays ever published by this most beloved of writers. From his travel sketches of Brooklyn, New Orleans, and Hollywood, written when he was twenty-two, to meditations about fame, fortune, and the writer&#x2019;s art at the peak of his career, to the brief works penned during the isolated denouement of his life, these essays provide an essential window into mid-twentieth-century America as offered by one of its canniest observers. Included are such celebrated masterpieces of narrative nonfiction as &#x201c;The Muses Are Heard&#x201d; and the short nonfiction novel &#x201c;Handcarved Coffins,&#x201d; as well as many long-out-of-print essays, including portraits of Isak Dinesen, Mae West, Marcel Duchamp, Humphrey Bogart, and Marilyn Monroe. <br><br>Among the highlights are &#x201c;Ghosts in Sunlight: The Filming of In Cold Blood, &#x201c;Preface to Music for Chameleons, in which Capote candidly recounts the highs and lows of his long career, and a playful self-portrait in the form of an imaginary self-interview.

Certainly, Capote was, as Somerset Maugham famously called him, &#x201c;a stylist of the first quality.&#x201d; But as the pieces gathered here remind us, he was also an artist of remarkable substance.</p><p>Truman Capote was born in New Orleans on September 30, 1924. He rose to international prominence in 1948 with the publication of his debut novel, <i>Other Voices, Other Rooms</i>. His other works of fiction include <i>Breakfast at Tiffany&#x2019;s, A Tree of Night, The Grass Harp</i>, and <i>Summer Crossing</i>, the author&#x2019;s long-lost first novel, which was rediscovered in 2004 and published by Random House in 2005. His nonfiction novel <i>In Cold Blood </i>is widely considered one of the greatest books of the twentieth century. Capote twice won the O. Henry Memorial Short Story Prize and was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. He died on August 25, 1984, shortly before his sixtieth birthday.Chapter 1 <br>NEW ORLEANS (1946)<br><br>In the courtyard there was an angel of black stone, and its angel head rose above giant elephant leaves; the stark glass angel eyes, bright as the bleached blue of sailor eyes, stared upward. One observed the angel from an intricate green balcony&#x2014;mine, this balcony, for I lived beyond in three old white rooms, rooms with elaborate wedding-cake ceilings, wide sliding doors, tall French windows. On warm evenings, with these windows open, conversation was pleasant there, tuneful, for wind rustled the interior like fan-breeze made by ancient ladies. And on such warm evenings the town is quiet. Only voices: family talk weaving on an ivy-curtained porch; a barefoot woman humming as she rocks a sidewalk chair, lulling to sleep a baby she nurses quite publicly; the complaining foreign tongue of an irritated lady who, sitting on her balcony, plucks a fryer, the loosened feathers floating from her hands, slipping into air, sliding lazily downward. One morning&#x2014;it was December, I think, a cold Sunday with a sad gray sun&#x2014;I went up through the Quarter to the old market, where at that time of year there are exquisite winter fruits, sweet satsumas, twenty cents a dozen, and winter flowers, Christmas poinsettia and snow japonica. New Orleans streets have long, lonesome perspectives; in empty hours their atmosphere is like Chirico, and things innocent, ordinarily (a face behind the slanted light of shutters, nuns moving in the distance, a fat dark arm lolling lopsidedly out some window, a lonely black boy squatting in an alley, blowing soap bubbles and watching sadly as they rise to burst), acquire qualities of violence. Now, on that morning, I stopped still in the middle of a block, for I&#x2019;d caught out of the corner of my eye a tunnel-passage, an overgrown courtyard. A crazy-looking white hound stood stiffly in the green fern light shining at the tunnel&#x2019;s end, and compulsively I went toward it. Inside there was a fountain; water spilled delicately from a monkey-statue&#x2019;s bronze mouth and made on pool pebbles desolate bell-like sounds. He was hanging from a willow, a bandit-faced man with kinky platinum hair; he hung so limply, like the willow itself. There was terror in that silent suffocated garden. Closed windows looked on blindly; snail tracks glittered silver on elephant ears, nothing moved except his shadow. It swung a little, back and forth, yet there was no wind. A rhinestone ring he wore winked in the sun, and on his arm was tattooed a name, &#x201c;Francy.&#x201d; The hound lowered its head to drink in the fountain, and I ran. Francy&#x2014;was it for her he&#x2019;d killed himself? I do not know. N.O. is a secret place. My rock angel&#x2019;s glass eyes were like sundials, for they told, by the amount of light focused on them, time: white at noon, they grew gradually dimmer, dark at dusk, black&#x2014;nightfall eyes in a nightfall head. The torn lips of golden-haired girls leer luridly on faded leaning house fronts: Drink Dr. Nutt, Dr. Pepper, Nehi, Grapeade, 7-Up, Koke, Coca-Cola. N.O., like every Southern town, is a city of soft-drink signs; the streets of forlorn neighborhoods are paved with Coca-Cola caps, and after rain, they glint in the dust like lost dimes. Posters peel away, lie mangled until storm wind blows them along the street, like desert sage&#x2014;and there are those who think them beautiful; there are those who paper their walls with Dr. Nutt and Dr. Pepper, with Coca-Cola beauties who, smiling above tenement beds, are night guardians and saints of the morning.

There was once this notice on a door in the Irish Channel district, &#x201c;Come In And See Where Jesus Stood.&#x201d; &#x201c;And so?&#x201d; said a woman who answered when I rang the bell. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to see where Jesus stood,&#x201d; I told her, and for a moment she looked blank; her face, cut in razorlike lines, was marshmallow-white; she had no eyebrows, no lashes, and she wore a calico kimono. &#x201c;You too little, honey,&#x201d; she said, a jerky laugh bouncing her breasts, &#x201c;you too damn little for to see where Jesus stood.&#x201d; In my neighborhood there was a certain caf� no fun whatever, for it was the emptiest caf� around N.O., a regular funeral place. The proprietress, Mrs. Morris Otto Kunze, did not, however, seem to mind; she sat all day behind her bar, cooling herself with a palmetto fan, and seldom stirred except to swat flies. Now glued over an old cracked mirror backing the bar were seven little signs all alike: Don&#x2019;t Worry About Life . . . You&#x2019;ll Never Get Out Of It Alive. July 3. An &#x201c;at home&#x201d; card last week from Miss Y., so I made a call this afternoon. She is delightful in her archaic way, amusing, too, though not by intent. The first time we met, I thought: Edna May Oliver; and there is a resemblance most certainly. Miss Y. speaks in premediated tones but what she says is haphazard, and her sherry-colored eyes are forever searching the surroundings. Her posture is military, and she carries a man&#x2019;s Malacca cane, one of her legs being shorter than the other, a condition which gives her walk a penguinlike lilt. &#x201c;It made me unhappy when I was your age; yes, I must say it did, for Papa had to squire me to all the balls, and there we sat on such pretty little gold chairs, and there we sat. None of the gentlemen ever asked Miss Y. to dance, indeed no, though a young man from Baltimore, a Mr. Jones, came here one winter, and gracious!&#x2014;poor Mr. Jones&#x2014;fell off a ladder, you know&#x2014;broke his neck&#x2014;died instantly.&#x201d; My interest in Miss Y. is rather clinical, and I am not, I embarrassedly confess, quite the friend she believes, for one cannot feel close to Miss Y.: she is too much a fairy tale, someone real&#x2014;and improbable. She is like the piano in her parlor&#x2014;elegant, but a little out of tune. Her house, old even for N.O., is guarded by a black broken iron fence; it is a poor neighborhood she lives in, one sprayed with room-for-rent signs, gasoline stations, jukebox caf�s. And yet, in the days when her family first lived here&#x2014;that, of course, was long ago&#x2014;there was in all N.O. no finer place. The house, smothered by slanting trees, has a graying exterior; but inside, the fantasy of Miss Y.&#x2019;s heritage is everywhere visible: the tapping of her cane as she descends birdwing stairs trembles crystal; her face, a heart of wrinkled silk, reflects fumelike on ceiling-high mirrors; she lowers herself (notice, as this happens, how carefully she preserves the comfort of her bones) into father&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s chair, a wickedly severe receptacle with lion-head hand-rests. She is beautiful here in the cool dark of her house, and safe. These are the walls, the fence, the furniture of her childhood. &#x201c;Some people are born to be old; I, for instance, was an atrocious child lacking any quality whatever. But I like being old. It makes me feel somehow more&#x201d;&#x2014;she paused, indicated with a gesture the dim parlor&#x2014;&#x201c;more suitable.&#x201d; Miss Y. does not believe in the world beyond N.O.; at times her insularity results, as it did today, in rather chilling remarks. I had mentioned a recent trip to New York, whereupon she, arching an eyebrow, replied gently, &#x201c;Oh? And how are things in the country?&#x201d; 1. Why is it, I wonder, that all N.O. cabdrivers sound as though they were imported from Brooklyn? 2. One hears so much about food here, and it is probably true that such restaurants as Arnaud&#x2019;s and Kolb&#x2019;s are the best in America. There is an attractive, lazy atmosphere about these restaurants: the slow-wheeling fans, the enormous tables and lack of crowding, the silence, the casual but expert waiters who all look as though they were sons of the management. A friend of mine, discussing N.O. and New York, once pointed out that comparable meals in the East, aside from being considerably more expensive, would arrive elaborate with some chef&#x2019;s mannerisms, with all kinds of froufrou and false accessories. Like most good things, the quality of N.O. cookery derived, he thought, from its essential simplicity. 3. I am more or less disgusted by that persistent phrase &#x201c;old charm.&#x201d; You will find it, I suppose, in the architecture here, and in the antique shops (where it rightly belongs), or in the minglings of dialect one hears around the French Market. But N.O. is no more charming than any other Southern city&#x2014;less so, in fact, for it is the largest. The main portion of this city is made up of spiritual bottomland, streets and sections rather outside the tourist belt. (From a letter to R.R.) There are new people in the apartment below, the third tenants in the last year; a transient place, this Quarter, hello and good-bye. A real bona-fide scoundrel lived there when I first came. He was unscrupulous, unclean and crooked&#x2014;a kind of dissipated satyr. Mr. Buddy, the one-man band. More than likely you have seen him&#x2014;not here of course, but in some other city, for he keeps on the move, he and his old banjo, drum, harmonica. I used to come across him banging away on various street corners, a gang of loafers gathered round. Realizing he was my neighbor, these meetings always gave me rather a turn. Now, to tell the truth, he was not a bad musician&#x2014;an extraordinary one, in fact, when, late of an afternoon, and for his own pleasure, he sang to his guitar, sang ghostly ballads in a grieving whiskey voice: how terrible it was for those in love. &#x201c;Hey, boy, you! You up there . . .&#x201d; I was you, for he never knew my name, and never showed much interest in finding it out. &#x201c;Come on down and help me kill a couple.&#x201d; His balcony, smaller t...</p><h2>2007 Shurley Method English Test Booklet Level 4</h2><p>This is the test book to go along with the Shurley English Level 4.</p><p></p><h2>The Raw and the Cooked: Adventures of a Roving Gourmand</h2><p>A complete collection of the author&#39;s food writings includes his Smart and Esquire columns, correspondence with French gourmet Gerard Oberle, and pieces on food in France and America for Men&#39;s Journal.</p><p>Jim Harrison's <i>The Raw and the Cooked</i> extols our profound (and precarious) relationship to what we eat, and to the natural world. Compiled from the author's much-loved <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Smart</i>, and <i>Men's Journal</i> columns, the book offers charging personal panoramas in the guise of food essays. In pieces with titles like "Conscious Dining," "Hunger, Real and Unreal," and "Repulsion and Grace," Harrison--a kind of dharma bum cum foodie--takes his readers into realms of taste and feeling, spirit and body. "We are often like autistic children," he writes, "unable to connect experiences, especially if we want something interesting to eat." A Michigan "outlander," he nonetheless travels wide and can tell of the "tummy thrills" engendered by trips to restaurants like Manhattan's Babbo, meals planned and meals remembered. But the journeys he likes best involve hunting or foraging, his personal salves: "I arrived home in a palsied state," he writes. "To set the brakes, I wandered for hours in the woods looking for morels. At one point I wandered three hours to find four morels. I did however gather enough to cook our annual spring rite, a simple saut� of the mushrooms, wild leeks and sweetbreads." <p> A warning: Harrison can lick his spiritual wounds publicly for long stretches, and not all readers will find his swaggering muscularity to their taste. Those who follow him are, however, rewarded by contact with his passion and sly, world-colliding depictions: "The dinner was a mystical experience," he writes, "and as such you must live through it to fully understand the mysticality ... less apparent when I got up next morning in a driving rainstorm with the usual flooded freeways." <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>A rumination on the unholy trinity of sex, death and food, this long-awaited collection of gastronomic essays reads like the love child of M.F.K. Fisher and James Thorne on acid. Harrison poet, novelist and screenplay writer perhaps best known for Legends of the Fall and Just Before Dark writes with a passion for language equal to his passion for good food. His thick, muscular phrases tumble off the tongue: you can almost hear him sampling the language as deliberately as he does his French burgundies, and with as much genuine pleasure. The essays filled with sightings of big names (Jack Nicholson, Peter Matthiessen) take readers from meals in Harrison's homes in northern Michigan and New Mexico, to delicacies in New York, Los Angeles and Paris; Harrison's palate, while refined, is refreshingly earthy. He is a lover of duck thighs, pigs' feet, calves' brains, foie gras, confit, sweetbreads, game birds and mussels, served with exquisite wines and "shovels of garlic." Perhaps not surprisingly, Harrison also ruminates on gout, weight and indigestion. But to him, the trade-off is worth it: "Only through the diligent use of sex and, you guessed it, food," he writes, "can we further ourselves, hurling our puny `I ams' into the face of twenty billion years of mute, cosmic history. With every fanny glance or savory bite you are telling a stone to take a hike, a mountain that you are alive, a star that you exist." Equally recommended for the literary crowd and armchair cooks (although perhaps not for vegetarians). <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Le Cordon Bleu Dessert Techniques: More Than 1,000 Photographs Illustrating 300 Preparation And Cooking Techniques For Making Tarts, Pi</h2><p>For the first time, the chefs and instructors of the world-renowned Le Cordon Bleu cooking schools have written a cookbook that will teach anyone, from novices with a sweet tooth to expert bakers, how to prepare beautiful and delicious desserts at home.

While America should speak out for human rights, the idea that we get in Russia&#x2019;s face and hand out moral report cards to every nation on earth is moral arrogance.&nbsp; While we have benefited from immigration and the melting pot worked with millions of Europeans, the idea we can import endless millions of aliens, legal and illegal, from every culture, clime, creed, and continent on earth, and still remain a country, is absurd.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;To save America the first imperative is to remove from power the ideologues of both parties who have nearly killed our country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;In his final chapter, Buchanan lays out ideas to prevent the end of America.&nbsp; He calls for a bottom-up review of all of America&#x2019;s Cold War commitments, a ten-point program to secure America&#x2019;s borders, ideas to halt the erosion of our national sovereignty and restore our manufacturing preeminence and economic independence, and a formula for finding the way to a cold peace in the culture wars.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Buchanan offers a radical but necessary program, for neither party is addressing the real crisis of America -- whether we survive as one nation and people, or disintegrate into what Theodore Roosevelt called a &#x201c;tangle of squabbling nationalities&#x201d; and not a nation at all.&nbsp;IN THIS EYE-OPENING BOOK, PAT BUCHANAN REVEALS THE PERILOUS PATH OUR NATION HAS TAKEN:<br><br>- <i>Pax Americana</i> -- the era of U.S. global dominance -- is over.<br><br>- A struggle for world hegemony among the United States, China, a resurgent Russia and radical Islam has begun.<br><br>- Torn apart by a culture war, America has begun to Balkanize and break down along class, cultural, ethnic, and racial lines.<br><br>- Free trade is hollowing out U.S. industry, destroying the dollar, and plunging the country into permanent dependency and unpayable debt.<br><br>- One of every six U.S. manufacturing jobs vanished under Bush. <br><br>- The Third World invasion through Mexico is a graver threat to U.S. survival than anything happening in Afghanistan or Iraq.&nbsp; <br><br>...IS OUR DAY OF RECKONING JUST AHEAD?</p><p>In his latest <i>New York Times</i> bestseller,&nbsp;Pat Buchanan deals with the greatest crisis facing the nation today: Whether the America we knew and loved will survive many more decades. Buchanan lays out how the United States is being secretly merged with Mexico and embedded in a Global Economy by that threatens the permanent loss of American independence and sovereignty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While free enterprise is good, the worship of &#x201c;free trade&#x201d; is de-industrializing America, killing the middle class, and imperiling U.S. economic independence.&nbsp;While America must stand for freedom, liberty and self-determination, the use of U.S. troops to police the planet or serve as advance guard&nbsp;is imperial folly that will bring down the republic.&nbsp;While America should speak out for human rights, the idea that we get in Russia&#x2019;s face and hand out moral report cards to every nation on earth is moral arrogance.&nbsp; While we have benefited from immigration, the idea we can import limitless numbers of aliens and remain anything like a real country is absurd.&nbsp; To save America the first imperative is to remove from power the ideologues of both parties who have near killed the country.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buchanan sees America in an existential crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his final chapter, he lays out ideas to stop the suicide of America.&nbsp; He includes a bottom-up review of all America&#x2019;s foreign commitments and entanglements, a plan to secure America&#x2019;s borders, ideas for halting the erosion of our sovereignty and for restoring our manufacturing preeminence and economic independence.&nbsp; Buchanan offers a radical program, but a necessary one, for neither party is addressing the real crisis of the nation -- whether we survive much longer as one people, or disappear from history.PATRICK J.

Alternatively told through the eyes of Sera, a Parsi widow whose pregnant daughter and son-in-law share her elegant home, and Bhima, the elderly housekeeper who must support her orphaned granddaughter, Umrigar does an admirable job of creating two sympathetic characters whose bond goes far deeper than that of employer and employee. <p> When we first meet Bhima, she is sharing a thin mattress with Maya, the granddaughter upon whom high hopes and dreams were placed, only to be shattered by an unexpected pregnancy and its disastrous consequences. As time goes on, we learn that Sera and her family have used their power and money time and time again to influence the lives of Bhima and Maya, from caring for Bhima's estranged husband after a workplace accident, to providing the funds for Maya's college education. We also learn that Sera's seemingly privileged life is not as it appears; after enduring years of cruelty under her mother-in-law's roof, she faced physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her husband, pain that only Bhima could see and alleviate. Yet through the triumphs and tragedies, Sera and Bhima always shared a bond that transcended class and race; a bond shared by two women whose fate always seemed to rest in the hands of others, just outside their control. </p><p> Told in a series of flashbacks and present day encounters, <i>The Space Between Us</i> gains strength from both plot and prose. A beautiful tale of tragedy and hope, Umrigar's second novel is sure to linger in readers' minds. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p><p>LIMITED EDITION</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps there are no phantom pains at all; perhaps all pain is real; perhaps each long-ago blow lives on into eternity in some different permutation and shape.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Fabulae Romanae: Stories of Famous Romans</h2><p><p>Designed for intermediate Latin students, this text explores the history of Rome as students read real, unadapted Latin literature.

Seafood is their specialty, with dishes such as Sea Bass, Clams, Bacon and Leeks in White Wine, and a Crispy Dill Snapper, which breaks the book's single-pan rule by utilizing an empty skillet to weigh down the fillets while they cook to keep them from curling. Four types of burgers hit the skillet including one made with lamb and feta cheese and another with pork and a Fennel-Apple Slaw. The Dutch oven is the source of comfort food like Clam Chowder and Buttermilk-Sage Fried Chicken, while the baking dish runs away with the spoon in desserts such as Chocolate-Hazelnut Bread Pudding and Strawberry-Rhubarb Crisp. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In her latest book, <em>Grunt</em>, she explores how our soldiers combat their non-gun-wielding opponents--panic, heat exhaustion, the runs, and more. It will give you a new appreciation not only for our men and women in uniform (and by the way, one of the innumerable things you&#x2019;ll learn is how and why they choose the fabric for those uniforms), but for the unsung scientist-soldiers tasked with coming up with ways to keep the &#x201c;grunts&#x201d; alive and well.

Written by Lynne Rossetto Kasper, author of <i>The Splendid Table: Recipes from Emilia-Romagna, the Heartland of Northern Italian Food</i> (winner of both the James Beard and Julia Child/IACP Cookbook-of-the-Year Awards), it is every bit the equal of its celebrated predecessor.<br><br>Read its exuberant pages, eat its lusty dishes, and you enter a landscape vibrant with rural life. You are one with the terrain. In some sense, you are home. That, of course, is the miracle of Italy&#x2014;no matter where we come from, we want to be a part of it. And the miracle of <i>The Italian Country Table</i> is its ability to take us there.<br> <br>And what a journey! You will never be as impatient to get into your kitchen as when you are planning a meal from this book. Two hundred recipes, personally collected from home cooks throughout the length and breadth of Italy, will keep calling you back.<br> <br>Who could resist the &#x201c;Gatto&#x201d; di Patate, a mashed-potato &#x201c;lasagna&#x201d; from the Neapolitan countryside? Or a Tuscan Mountain Supper of warm beans tossed with an herbed tomato sauce and eaten with tart greens? Or Pasta of the Grape Harvest, a Sicilian dish of grapes, red wine, orange zest, spices, pistachios and linguine? Or Chocolate Polenta Pudding Cake?<br> <br>Kasper, host of Public Radio's <i>The Splendid Table,</i> is a master teacher who thinks about cooking in a way that is radically distinctive. Her chapter on tomatoes and tomato sauces, a treasure by itself, will change the way you think about them&#x2014;and cook them&#x2014;forever. Her guide to buying and saucing pasta contains more useful facts than many books that devote themselves to pasta exclusively.<br> <br>Kasper, the grandchild of Italian immigrants, describes herself as someone with a love of lingering &#x201c;in places where life changes slowly.&#x201d; This personal book abounds with stories of artisans, farmers and family. It is a portrait of Italian country life.<br> <br>Where you read <i>The Italian Country Table,</i> cook from it or use it to plan a trip (there is an appendix that lists guest farms, country hotels, restaurants and museums), you have only to turn its pages to be transported to a rustic Italy that few of us know, but all of us long for.<br> <br>-16 pages of finished dishes in full color<br> <br>-50 black-and-white photographs of country life</p><p>Lynne Rossetto Kasper's authoritative first book, <i>The Splendid Table</i>, explored the food and culture of Emilia-Romagna, Italy's culinary heartland. In <i>The Italian Country Table</i>, a collection of 200 regional recipes gathered from farmhouse cooks, Kasper once again provides cultural investigation and authentic, workable recipes. The resulting cookbook-cum-chronicle will appeal to anyone seeking delicious, down-to-earth dishes and an introduction to cherished culinary traditions.<p> Covering every course of an Italian meal--from antipasti through pasta to vegetables and, of course, dessert--the book weaves recipes with vignettes exploring, for example, Puglia's ritual drying of winter tomatoes. Included also are notes on buying tips, special cooking techniques such as glazing, and discussions of culinary moment, like the nature of a true risotto Milanese. The immediately inviting recipes include such temptations as Mushrooms Stuffed with Radicchio and Asiago, Hot and Spicy Eggplant Soup, Leg of Lamb Glazed with Balsamic and Red Wine, and Espresso Ricotta Cream with Espresso Chocolate Sauce. Kasper also offers a chapter on focaccia, pizza, and bread, as well as menus, shopping sources, and a useful discussion of ingredients. (Taste before you buy, and then pause, she advises. "Aftertaste can reveal how a food's been stored, careless production, or foods going from mature to over the hill.") Concluding with a guide to Italian guest farms, folk life museums, and places to eat and shop, the book is a comprehensive introduction to basic but inspired home cooking and the traditions that both contain and nurture it. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p><b>Lynne Rossetto Kasper</b> is host of the nationally broadcast radio show <i>The Splendid Table with Lynne Rossetto Kasper,</i> Public Radio's food program and winner of the 1998 James Beard Award For Best National Radio Show on Food Her first book, <i>The Splendid Table Recipes from Emilia-Romagna, the Heartland of Northern Italian Food,</i> is the only winner of both the James Beard and Julia Child/IACP Cookbook-of-the-Year Awards as well as the Julia Child Best First Book Award.</p><h2>SUMMER&#39;S DAY</h2><p>Gathers color photographs of summer landscapes and people relaxing at the beach and in their yards</p><p>Born in the Bronx in 1938.

Constance Rattigan, an aging, once-glamorous Hollywood star, stands soaked and shivering in his foyer, clutching two anonymously delivered books that have sent her running in fear from something she dares not acknowledge: twin lists of the Tinseltown dead and soon-to-be dead . . . with Constance's name included among them.</p><p>And, just as suddenly, she vanishes into the stormy night, leaving the narrator with her macabre "gifts" and an unshakable determination to get to the root of the actress's grand terror.</p><p>So begins an odyssey as dark as it is wondrous, as the writer sets off in a broken-down jalopy with his irascible sidekick, Crumley, to sift through the ashes of a bygone Hollywood. But a world that once sparkled with larger- than-life luminaries -- Dietrich, Valentino, Harlow -- is now a graveyard of ghosts and secrets. Each twisted road our heroes travel leads to grim shrines and shattered dreams -- a remote cabin where history is preserved in mountains of yellowed newsprint; a cathedral where sinners hold sway; a forgotten projection booth where the past lives eternally on in an endless loop of cinematic youth and beauty. And always the road turns back to lost filmdom's temple, a fading movie palace called Grauman's Chinese, and to the murky hidden catacombs beneath.</p><p>Prepare yourself for a mystery as enthralling as the most well-crafted whodunit; a satire as keen as the edge of a straight razor, a phantasmagoric celebration of a lost world built on equal parts dream and nightmare -- the latest fantastic flight of glorious imagination by Ray Bradbury, the one and only.</p></p><p><p>In a career spanning more than seventy years, Ray Bradbury, who died on June 5, 2011 at the age of 91, inspired generations of readers to dream, think, and create. A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to fifty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, teleplays, and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time. His groundbreaking works include <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, <em>The Martian Chronicles</em>, <em>The Illustrated Man</em>, <em>Dandelion Wine</em>, and <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em>. He wrote the screen play for John Huston's classic film adaptation of <em>Moby Dick</em>, and was nominated for an Academy Award. He adapted sixty-five of his stories for television's <em>The Ray Bradbury Theater</em>, and won an Emmy for his teleplay of <em>The Halloween Tree</em>. He was the recipient of the 2000 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2004 National Medal of Arts, and the 2007 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, among many honors.</p><p>Throughout his life, Bradbury liked to recount the story of meeting a carnival magician, Mr. Electrico, in 1932. At the end of his performance Electrico reached out to the twelve-year-old Bradbury, touched the boy with his sword, and commanded, "Live forever!" Bradbury later said, "I decided that was the greatest idea I had ever heard. I started writing every day. I never stopped."</p>Bradbury, a legend in his own time, seems never to run out of creative inspiration. He follows up last year's acclaimed From the Dust Returned with a mystery novel that's also a loving, tongue-in-cheek tribute to early Hollywood. Set in 1960, the book features an unnamed science fiction writer ("what if... in some future date people use newspapers or books to start fires," he muses aloud). Late one night (stormy, of course), while he's trying to finish a novel, ancient but still-beautiful screen star Constance Rattigan bursts into his house frantically waving a 1900 Los Angeles telephone directory-the "Book of the Dead," as the writer calls it. Someone has left it at her house, with the names of those still alive circled in red and marked with a sinister cross-her name among them. Is she being marked for death? With his sidekick, Elmo Crumley, the writer dashes from one storied Los Angeles spot to the next, looking for the would-be murderer and warning the others on the list. The tour includes Rattigan's house, set on a nerve-wracking bluff and home to tons of ancient newspapers and a spookily decrepit old man who turns out to be Rattigan's brother, Clarence. Many other eccentrics make an appearance in this whirlwind of staccato dialogue, puns and references to old Hollywood and Chandler-era L.A. noir. Bradbury's giddy pleasure is infectious; though he throws in an unexpected conclusion, it's the author's exuberant voice more than the mystery itself that will have readers hooked. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Rabbit Novels Vol. 2</h2><p><b><i>The third and fourth novel in John Updike&#x2019;s acclaimed quartet of Rabbit books&#x2013;now in one marvelous volume.<br></i></b><br><b>RABBIT IS RICH<br>Winner of the American Book Award and<br>the National Book Critics Circle Award</b><br><br>&#x201c;Dazzlingly reaffirms Updike&#x2019;s place as master chronicler of the spiritual maladies and very earthly pleasure of the Middle-American male.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>Vogue<br><br></i>&#x201c;A splendid achievement!&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>The New York Times<br><br></i><br><b>RABBIT AT REST<br>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and<br>the National Book Critics Circle Award<br></b><br>&#x201c;Brilliant . . .

But unfortunately, Percy's attempts to ingratiate himself with Polly's parents fail miserably, so Sampson and the mice devise a clever scheme to help him out. Fans of the nine earlier "Church Mice" books (Atheneum) will enjoy this heartily; Sampson is just as cranky, Humphrey just as long-winded, and the plot just as convoluted as ever.

Completely resigned to their fate. A fly landed on the forehead of the nearest one&#x2014;the one he was to kill&#x2014;and the captive let it crawl about, tasting his sweat.</p><p>Jacob listened to the spokesman continue to rail in Arabic, a small crowd gathered in the square, outnumbered two to one by the gunmen. He didn&#x2019;t understand the language but could guess at what was being said.</p><p><i>These men are traitors. This is the fate that befalls all who oppose the </i>Kalipha<i>. Stand with us, or suffer the same.</i></p><p>Far from cheering, the small grouping of people looked cowed, as if they wanted to be anywhere but there. Well, that wasn&#x2019;t exactly true. They&#x2019;d rather be on the outside watching than on their bellies with their necks stretched out.</p><p>The spokesman droned on, building toward a grand spectacle, his black tunic covered in dust, the AK-47 swinging about with his body language, and Jacob knew it was coming close. Execution time. His first.</p><p>In the seven months he&#x2019;d been inside the cult of death known as the Islamic State, he&#x2019;d witnessed many, many executions, acting as a gunman on the periphery, but he&#x2019;d never done one on his own.</p><p>Not that he minded killing. It hadn&#x2019;t bothered him in the past, but the action had always been at the barrel of a gun, and he wondered how this would feel. In a detached, almost scientific way, he wondered if it would be different from carving the carcasses of the rabbits he&#x2019;d killed in his youth. When he&#x2019;d literally had to hunt for survival.</p><p>He looked at his partners, seeing Hussein fidgeting, the nervous tics growing more pronounced. He wasn&#x2019;t built for this cauldron, and Jacob thought it ironic that Hussein was the one who had recruited them. Convinced them to come to this faraway land.</p><p>Not that they had many alternatives after fleeing the cesspool of &#x201c;rehabilitation&#x201d; they&#x2019;d been placed within. Killing the guard had ensured that.</p><p>Carlos and Devon, now known as Yousef and Talib, showed no such hesitation. They had embraced the cult of death completely, changing their names and fervently soaking up the Salafist ideology like a cactus in the rain. They were on board one hundred and ten percent, considering this day a sacred one.</p><p>Jacob played the role, but he&#x2019;d long since lost belief in religion. Any religion. He&#x2019;d had that whipped out of him by the pious Christian guards in the white house.</p><p>No, it wasn&#x2019;t the religion. It was the power. In this land, from Mosul to Raqqa, all that mattered was the courage of the battle-axe, and he&#x2019;d found a skill that he didn&#x2019;t realize he possessed. He knew he would die here, but it caused no angst. In truth, he had died long ago. All that remained was for him to slip the coils of his mortal frame. The difference was a cause. He wouldn&#x2019;t end up as a page-two news story, caught stealing hubcaps and gunned down in the street. And neither would the men he had brought.</p><p>Hussein may have recruited him, and the other two may have changed their names, diving headlong into the myth of the Islamic State, but he was the leader of their small group. Just as he had been inside.</p><p>With that mantle came a responsibility.</p><p>A man in black, completely covered from head to toe, like something out of a <i>Star Wars</i> movie, began walking his way. Jacob inwardly grimaced.</p><p>His name was Abu Yabba Dabba Do, or some other unpronounceable Arabic crap, but Jacob called him Ringo. As in the Beatles. An Islamic fighter from England, he and others like him considered themselves above Jacob and his band because they were of Arabic descent. Ringo was Yemeni. Jacob was a mutt.</p><p>&#x201c;So, Jacob, are you ready for your first kill?&#x201d;</p><p>He drew out the name <i>Jacob</i>, showing his disdain for the Biblical reference and the fact that Jacob refused to take an Arabic one.</p><p>Jacob said, &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t my first, you shit.&#x201d;</p><p>Ringo smirked and said, &#x201c;Death with a gun is not killing. You&#x2019;ll see. This is absolute control. Absolute. As Mohammad dictated. But your little band of Lost Boys wouldn&#x2019;t know about that.&#x201d;</p><p>He was being tested, which was what he expected. Ringo had beheaded many men, and had developed a cult following on Twitter and other social media, but he was an ass. A small man who gained importance after the fact. After the fighting was done, using his knife and a camera to become famous. At his core, Jacob knew Ringo felt a challenge from him and his friends.</p><p>Four tightly knit brothers, forged by a fire outside the Islamic State, with&#x2014;except for Hussein&#x2014;no attachment to any Arabic or Islamic heritage, they were an anomaly. True foreign fighters in a foreign land. They called themselves the Lost Boys because of the iconic &#x2019;80s movie, but the analogy was apt. They lived in a world of the shadows.</p><p>And they killed better than most.</p><p>Jacob said, &#x201c;Ringo, step away.&#x201d;</p><p>That was all.</p><p>And Ringo did.</p><p>Ringo had seen the punishment the Lost Boys had endured. With two blond Caucasians, one African American, and Hussein, the one who had recruited them, their arrival had been anything but welcoming. Convinced they were spies or, at best, journalists, the emir had subjected them to inhuman conditions and cruelty. And they had thrived.</p><p>Because of the white house.</p><p>Ringo said, &#x201c;You are not the future. <i>We</i> are the future. <i>Kafir</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>Jacob looked up, catching Ringo&#x2019;s pompous eyes with the dead ones he possessed, and said, &#x201c;The future is dictated by the man who isn&#x2019;t afraid to die. Is that you?&#x201d;</p><p>Ringo said, &#x201c;I am not afraid. I have proved that multiple times.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you wish to die today? Without fear?&#x201d;</p><p>Jacob knew his reputation from Mosul preceded him. Knew that Ringo hated the fact that he was a blond-headed, blue-eyed American, with no ancestral ties to the coming caliphate, but he also knew that Ringo couldn&#x2019;t get past the stories that had grown into legends.</p><p>Ringo snarled and said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see, Lost Boy. We&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;</p><p>And walked away.</p><p>The man on the square finished his speech, which was like every other one, and not unlike speeches given by the blowhard preachers Jacob had heard every night in the reform school. There was a flourish at the end, then a knife placed in his hand.</p><p>He looked at the four men prostrate in front of him, and felt the hatred.</p><p>They were snitches. People who&#x2019;d sold out the clan for money, giving information to the enemy for targeted air strikes and intelligence on how the Islamic State functioned. Jacob would have had qualms about killing someone for eating pork or not wearing a head wrap, but he had none for traitors.</p><p>They were the ones who had caused the pain in his past. Had caused the trips to the white house.</p><p>He looked at his man, a Kurd. Strange that such a person had been able to penetrate so deeply, given the fight against the Peshmerga, but he had. And he&#x2019;d given massive information about the Islamic State to the Americans. Now he would die.</p><p>But the fly on his forehead would live.</p><p>He swished the man&#x2019;s face and saw it buzz away. Then leaned down, wrapping his hand into the hair, pulling it up.</p><p>As he had as a child, when the next &#x201c;new&#x201d; father had come into the room, stinking of whiskey and taking off his belt, he let his humanity float away, flying on a cloud. Gone.</p><p>He became a man of stone.</p><p>He looked down the line, seeing the ubiquitous cameraman recording the killing, then Carlos and Devon eagerly snatching up their own heads and looking to him for guidance. He waited on Hussein.</p><p>He caught the tears on Hussein&#x2019;s cheeks and wondered if the man would go through with it. He saw Ringo advancing and shouted, &#x201c;Hussein!&#x201d;</p><p>His friend looked at him and Jacob said, &#x201c;For the white house. Do it for the white house.&#x201d;</p><p>Hussein rapidly nodded, then pulled up the head.</p><p>Jacob turned to his own man, seeing his eyes rolling back, feeling the shaking in his body, the bright orange smock soaked in sweat.</p><p>The first swipe brought a gout of blood. He reached bone, and began sawing.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>Omar al-Khatami watched the tape without a shred of revulsion, technically looking for the propaganda value. His media specialist described how he had enhanced the image, optimizing it for YouTube, and said, &#x201c;This will show the Americans what happens to their spies, and prevent others from following in their steps.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar said, &#x201c;Yes. Post it tonight. End with the heads on the bodies.&#x201d;</p><p>The door opened and the emir of northern Syria entered.</p><p>Mildly surprised, Omar exchanged greetings and said, &#x201c;Adnan, I thought you weren&#x2019;t returning for two days. What is happening with the oil?&#x201d;</p><p>Adnan smiled and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming along. We only have the wells pumping at a quarter of capacity because of a lack of technical skill, but we have found men to change that. Soon, we will double our output and our revenues. As long as you don&#x2019;t lose the fields.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar said, &#x201c;No chance of that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good, because I have some news. The caliph has bestowed a great honor on you. He has promoted you to the emir of external operations.&#x201d;</p><p>The mention of the leader of the Islamic State brought a pause. Confused, Omar said, &#x201c;External operations? I am the military commander here. I still have work to do. Aleppo to take. Damascus to burn.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The caliph has heard of your Lost Boys, and he thinks it is time to use them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then do so, but don&#x2019;t pull me from my men. They fight because of me. The time is growing short for victory. This will be a setback we can&#x2019;t afford, given the American attacks.&#x201d;</p><p>Adnan scowled and said, &#x201c;The caliph believes in you. And your American cell. He chose you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why? We have many men who could do this. You, for instance.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because of your skill, for one. And because you are Chechen. You have traveled in Europe. You know the contacts. You can build the attack he desires.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;These Lost Boys are untested. I&#x2019;m unsure of their commitment.&#x201d;</p><p>Adnan looked at the computer screen, the video paused with four men slicing and cutting. &#x201c;Is this not them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They show commitment here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It could be simple fear. Hussein, the Jordanian, cried throughout.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the others?&#x201d;</p><p>Omar grudgingly admitted they showed no qualms, but said, &#x201c;The leader of these so-called Lost Boys hasn&#x2019;t even taken a proper name. He still goes by Jacob.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you tested him, yes?&#x201d;</p><p>Omar nodded. Adnan said, &#x201c;The name is why we want them. They will all revert back to their true names. They are gems buried in the sand. Four Americans with no ties to America. No families, no Facebook, no Twitter. They are unknown. Unlike the others who brag to their friends back home, nobody knows they exist. No authorities are fervently tracking their moves. True?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. We instructed them on methods of recruitment, but they have shown no interest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. Keep it that way. Their mission will be the greatest recruitment drive we have ever seen.&#x201d;</p><p>The media specialist fidgeted, getting Adnan&#x2019;s attention. He said, &#x201c;Emir, they are on this video. The one we&#x2019;re going to post for the world to see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t. Broadcast the stills of the verdict, but keep the executioners out.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar said, &#x201c;We lose the impact with our own people. They need to see. They need to fear.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then let our men see it, but obscure the faces, and do not put it on social media. The Americans must be protected, and those <i>kafirs</i> in the United States have ways of determining the tiniest things.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar nodded. &#x201c;It will be done. What about me?&#x201d;</p><p>Adnan looked at him with a question, and he said, &#x201c;When do you wish me to start, and what will the target be?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Targets. Plural. Every attack attempted by that windbag Zawahiri and his diseased al Qaida has resulted in failure because the <i>kafirs</i> managed to hear about it before execution. We have to assume the same will happen here, so we will plan two attacks. One for them to chase, and one for you to execute.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar went through the ramifications in his mind. Having fought in Grozny against a barbaric Russian army, he recognized the wisdom. He said, &#x201c;Just preparation for the false flag attack?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, no. A real attack. One that you will plan from start to finish. You pick the target and the method. The only parameter is that it must be outside of the caliphate. Outside the borders here. If it succeeds, so much the better, but its primary mission is to protect your American cell. Obviously, don&#x2019;t tell the other team about that. Let them think they are the chosen ones.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar absorbed the words, glancing away and nodding, thinking through the possibilities. He said, &#x201c;And the real target?&#x201d;</p><p>Adnan smiled and said, &#x201c;The real one will destroy the heart of the <i>kafirs</i>.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>3</p><p>Waiting on the president to finish, eyes glued to a television, Colonel Hale sat with the rest of the Oversight Council, watching him getting raked over the coals in the White House James S.

In this booklet, noted Carmelite retreat director Sam Anthony Morello shows how the tradition of lectio can assist us in following the Teresian way of prayer, and how in turn Teresa&#39;s insights and attitudes can enrich our contemporary practice of lectio. In clear and practical language, the author explains the fundamental ingredients of Teresian prayer, and relates them to lectio (reading), meditatio (meditation), oratio (prayer), and contemplatio (contemplation), the four traditional elements of lectio divina. A closing series of reflection questions make this an ideal introduction to Teresian prayer for both group discussion and individual study.</p><p></p><h2>Harris and Me</h2><p>This summer will be different.

C Ryle wrote this timeless classic on holiness over a hundred years ago, yet how poignant his words still are for us today. Sadly, we all know how easy it is to appear godly in public, while behind closed doors to continue in our own sin. </p> <p>This modern English version will challenge a new generation of readers to live a Christ like life. Ryle's timeless wisdom reminds us that holiness shouldn't be cold, distant and unobtainable, but that Christ himself is the root of our godliness. Be exhorted not to simply settle for half hearted holiness, but to strive to be holy in every area of our lives. </p> <p>Holiness, Ryle argued, was not simply a matter of believing and feeling, but of doing.</p></p><p>J.

Offering clear, step-by-step instruction for painting a range of subjects, she focuses on the little details first, from soil and leaves to wildflowers and birds. As artists are guided piece-by-piece through the wonders of different panoramic settings, they will learn to combine these elements into full-scale projects--quiet forest scenes, coral reefs teeming with color, prairies, deserts, ponds and mountains--all alive with the beauty and joy of nature.</p><p>Claudia Nice is a self-taught artist who has developed her realistic style by sketching from nature. Throughout her career, she has won numerous awards for her work and has shared her masterful techniques through her workshops and bestselling books. These titles include Creating Textures in Pen &amp; Ink with Watercolor, Sketching Your Favorite Subjects in Pen &amp; Ink and How to Keep a Sketchbook Journal. She lives in Sandy, Oregon.Nice offers a large-format color exploration of the natural world in broad context. The forest scenes, the coral reef, and desert themes help create a substantial manual in an up-to-date format. If the budget is tight, Dover offers a reprint of Sy and Dorothea Barlow's Illustrating Nature (1997), which has a preponderance of black-and-white illustrations. But spring for Nice's volume if the budget allows.<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Feminization of American Culture</h2><p>Draws on novels, religious pamphlets and manuals, and anti-sentimentalist writings of nineteenth-century America to show how genteel women and Protestant clergymen fostered the emergence of a consumer culture</p><p>This classic of modern feminism is an ambitious attempt to trace certain present-day values back to cultural shifts of the 19th century. Historian Ann Douglas entwines the fate of American women, most notably those of the white middle class, with that of clergy marginalized by the rise in religious denominations and consequent dilution of their power base. No longer invited to wield influence in vital (some might say traditionally masculine) political and economic arenas, clergy were pushed toward more feminine spheres and rules of expression. Likewise, as growing numbers of middle-class white women lost their place as the indispensable center of household production, and many lower-class women became easily replaced industrial cogs, a none-too-subtle shift in perceptions about women's strengths and abilities occurred. Women lost voting rights and other legal privileges; barred from healing and midwifery, they were also less likely to appear in other increasingly male professions. Academies for wealthier girls imparted skills deemed to entice and soothe men without taxing supposedly tiny feminine brains; when Emma Willard offered geometry lessons to girls in the 1820s, one opponent harrumphed: "They'll be educating cows next." Douglas chronicles the rise of an overwhelmingly sentimental "feminization" of mass culture--in which writers of both sexes underscored popular convictions about women's weaknesses, desires, and proper place in the world--with erudite and well-argued scholarship. <i>--Francesca Coltrera</i>A modern classic by one of the leading feminist thinkers of our time, <i>The Feminization Of American Culture</i> has been continuously in print since its original publication more than fifteen years ago. An Anchor backlist title since 1988, this book has been given a provocative new cover design to capture the attention of the readers who made <i>Sexual Personae</i> a best-seller. <i>The Feminization Of American Culture</i> seeks to explain the values prevalent in today's popular culture by tracing them back to their roots in Victorian times. Ferninist scholar Ann Douglas examines the best-selling novels and magazines of the day to show how women exploited their feminine image and idealized the very qualities that kept them powerless: timidity, piety, narcissism, and a disdain for competition. Here is a major rethinking of the American past with shocks of recognition for evervone today.</p><h2>The Hideout</h2><p>Twelve-year-old Andy feels he would be better off with his father in England than in his San Francisco home with his mother and her new husband. To raise the money needed to finance his trip to England, he stages his own kidnapping, but the plan backfires when someone decides to make the kidnapping a reality. &#x201c;A common family situation becomes action-filled drama in Bunting&#x2019;s capable hands.&#x201d;--Booklist</p><p><p>Eve Bunting has written&nbsp;over two hundred&nbsp;books for children, including the Caldecott Medal-winning <i>Smoky Night,</i> illustrated by David Diaz, <i>The Wall</i>,<i> Fly Away Home</i>, and <i>Train to Somewhere</i>. She lives in Southern California.</p>Grade 5-7-- Resentful of his stepfather, Paul, 12-year-old Andy runs away from home, finds a hotel key by chance, and moves into a plush suite. Since it is seldom occupied, it seems an ideal hideout--until the unpredictable hotel staff threaten his security. After several close calls, Andy is discovered, then kidnapped, and ultimately rescued by Paul and the police. Chastened by the harrowing experience, Andy regrets not only his actions but also his attitude toward a man who obviously cares for him. The novel has elements of Bunting's Is Anybody There? (Lippincott, 1988), including the illicit use of a key, a hideaway, and a boy too scared to sleep at night, but the overall plot is less plausible. However, the involving first-person narrative and the mounting tension offset the unlikely events. Andy's character--his jealousy of Paul and fear of discovery--is vividly portrayed. Those who like light mysteries should find this easy-to-read, moderately suspenseful story satisfying. --Pat Katka, San Diego Public Library<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Day for Damnation (War Against the Chtorr, Book 2)</h2><p>McCarthy was drafted from his college biology studies and became a member of the Special Forces.

Then came a tragic accident. Now Dixie's a pet-sitter on Siesta Key, a lush, exotic barrier island where the people tend to be rich, suntanned, and tolerant of one another's quirks.&nbsp;As Dixie tried to get her life back in order, pet-sitting is the perfect job. She goes into people's homes while they're gone and takes care of their pets; she likes the animals, they like her, and she doesn't have to deal with people very much. She especially does not have to be afraid that she'll run into a situation that will cause her to lose her hard-won composure.&nbsp;But when Dixie finds a man bizarrely drowned in a cat's water bowl, she is drawn into a tangled web of danger and secrets. Unbeknownst to Lieutenant Guidry, the homicide detective handling the murder, Dixie begins her own investigation into the whereabouts of the cat's owner, who has now vanished. Fans of <i>The Cat Who...</i> book series by Lilian Jackson Braun will adore this riveting new pet-oriented sleuth and will eagerly await Dixie's next case: Will duplicity dog the dachshund?</p><h2>North of Nowhere: An Alex McKnight Novel (Alex McKnight Mysteries)</h2><p>Summer has finally arrived in Paradise, Michigan, but Alex McKnight doesn't seem to notice the change in the weather. He's been retreating into own his private world the past few months and now he barely leaves his cabin except to go have his meals in the nearby Glasgow Inn. The Inn's proprietor, Jackie, is more and more concerned with Alex's state, and the last straw comes as he watches Alex morosely counting up his "failures" on the eve of his 49th birthday-- his marriage, his baseball career, his stint in the Detroit police. He offers his friend an ultimatum: "Either I take you to the airport and put your ass on a plane to Moosehide or you play poker with me tonight." <br><br>The other poker players are men Alex hardly knows, in a posh house near the water. In the middle of the game, masked robbers invade the premises, hold the players at gunpoint and proceed to rob the homeowner. Alex is roused to action and so is his former detective partner, Leon Prudell. Working first against one another and later together, they discover that the crime is far more complex than a simple robbery. There is murder and greed and revenge involved, and a wild chase on the waters of Lake Superior before Alex is forced to realize that there is no retreat from life. And that maybe this is a good thing. <br></p><p>That Steve Hamilton has won a following by writing private-eye novels about a guy who has no interest in being a PI is testament both to his storytelling talents and readers' hunger for fresh approaches to this genre. <i>North of Nowhere</i> finds ex-Detroit cop Alex McKnight celebrating his 49th birthday by retreating to his cabin in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where he laments his personal and career failures. Eventually, though, McKnight is coaxed out with the prospect of a poker game, hosted by wealthy contractor Winston Vargas, only to have the game interrupted by armed men in masks, who empty Vargas's safe and leave clues suggesting that Alex and his fellow players engineered the heist.<p> Now, McKnight <i>really</i> has reason to feel sorry for himself. But instead, he goes after the gunmen, along the way swapping sucker punches with Vargas, shaking down his former detective partner (who videotaped the thieves' escape), and discovering that even his friends harbor secrets that could get them all killed.</p><p> This fourth McKnight outing (after 2001's <i>The Hunting Wind</i>) is a fine showcase for Hamilton's lithesome prose. The pace is brisk, the episodes often humorous, and the tale brims with an infectious reverence for its natural setting ("God help me, on a summer night when the sun is going down, it is the most beautiful place on earth"). If Hammett moved the detective story from the drawing room into the mean streets, Hamilton has proved that the north woods have their own potential for homicidal intrigue. <i>--J. Kingston Pierce</i></p>"Steve Hamilton writes the kind of stories that [one] can't resist."<br>--"The New York Times Book Review" <br>Steve Hamilton's debut novel "A Cold Day In Paradise" was the first novel to capture mystery's three most prestigious awards-the Edgar, the Shamus, and the Anthony awards for best first novel. Now "North of Nowhere" returns to the beautiful and dangerous landscapes of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where former Detroit cop Alex McKnight's attempts to leave civilization behind only lead to disaster... <br>Lying facedown on the floor with a gun to the back of his head is where Alex McKnight finds himself after a game of cards turns into a professional heist at the home of local developer Win Vargas. When the dust settles, McKnight is one of police chief Roy Maven's lead suspects. Worse, Vargas' own sense of vigilante justice has targeted the former private eye as well, and the brash millionaire may be responsible for the sudden disappearance of Alex's best friend, Jackie. Now, with officials pointed in the wrong direction and his closest allies either missing or in jail, Alex knows he is the only one who can uncover the truth. But McKnight can't possibly know how dark this conspiracy truly is-or how close to guilt he actually stands...<br></p><h2>Redeeming Childbirth: Experiencing His Presence in Pregnancy, Labor, Childbirth, and Beyond</h2><p>Childbirth is more than an event that makes a woman a mother.

Why Her?: Finding Real Love By Understanding Your Personality Type</h2><p><p><b>A groundbreaking book about how your personality type determines who you love</b></p><p>Why do you fall in love with one person rather than another? In this fascinating and informative book, Helen Fisher, one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on romantic love, unlocks the hidden code of desire and attachment. Each of us, it turns out, primarily expresses one of four broad personality types&#x2014;Explorer, Builder, Director, or Negotiator&#x2014;and each of these types is governed by different chemical systems in the brain. Driven by this biology, we are attracted to partners who both mirror and complement our own personality type. </p><p>Until now the search for love has been blind, but Fisher pulls back the curtain and reveals how we unconsciously go about finding the right match. Drawing on her unique study of 40,000 men and women, she explores each personality type in detail and shows you how to identify your own type. Then she explains why some types match up well, whereas others are problematic. (Note to Explorers: be prepared for a wild ride when you hitch your star to a fellow Explorer!) Ultimately, Fisher&#x2019;s investigation into the complex nature of romance and attachment leads to astonishing new insights into the essence of dating, love, and marriage.</p><p>Based on entirely new research&#x2014;including a detailed questionnaire completed by&nbsp;seven million people in thirty-three countries&#x2014;<i>Why Him?

And may your days be very long upon this earth.&#x201d;<br>The Apache Indians of the American Southwest probably recited this wedding poem for centuries before I heard it in La Jolla, California, in 2006. It was an early June evening, the sky still pink and blue, the sea smells wafting through the windows as I sat in a folding chair on the second story of a fancy Italian restaurant. An older gentleman was conducting a short wedding ceremony, one mixed with rituals from the Christian, Jewish and Apache traditions. And before me glowed the two celebrants, Patrick and Suzanne&#x2014;one of the first couples to marry after meeting on the Internet dating site I had helped to design, Chemistry.com.<br>Patrick had been a journalist in New Orleans until he lost his job, his home and all of his belongings to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. West he went, taking up residence with relatives in Los Angeles in February 2006. Days after settling in, he joined Chemistry.com and received his first recommended match: Suzanne, a lawyer living in La Jolla. That first night they talked for three hours on the phone. They met the following weekend and fell passionately in love.<br>So on a balmy evening during an April vacation together in Paris, Patrick took her to the top of the Eiffel Tower and proposed. The dazzled young woman grinned her &#x201c;yes.&#x201d; So here I sat at a fancy Italian restaurant in La Jolla, surrounded by some fifty of their friends and relatives on this festive wedding eve.<br>I like being around people who are in love. They have a contagious energy. This force was palpable in the groom, the first to arrive for the nuptials. He burst into the room, filling it with his vivacious charm. Although we had never met, he greeted me warmly. We instantly struck up a conversation about the evolution of the English language, his experience as a journalist in some dangerous parts of Asia and some of my past work on the brain chemistry of romantic love.<br>Others soon arrived, and we took our places on the folding chairs facing a small bar strewn with lilies. Last came the bride. I was stunned when saw her&#x2014;a tiny, perfectly formed, porcelain-like doll, with huge blue eyes and long auburn hair in soft ringlets wreathed in forget-me-nots. Like the mythological Helen, Suzanne had a face that could launch a thousand ships. And her vigor matched his. She was enraptured by her prince, gazing at him and grinning with uncontainable effervescence as she said &#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br>Someone played a flute. The Apache poem was read. And as the bride and groom walked down the makeshift aisle between our seats, we blew bubbles at them from the little bottles left on our chairs. Then came the feast: platters of Cavatelli Marinara, Antipasto Rustico, mussels, sausages, Chicken Fra Diavolo&#x2014;a host of Italian favorites appeared at every table amid the balloons, confetti and champagne as the disc jockey blasted out old tunes and we wildly danced. Patrick and Suzanne swirled among us, radiating joy.<br>&#x201c;Love hopes all things,&#x201d; the Bible says. I hoped for Patrick and Suzanne. But I also had a reason to be optimistic about their marriage. I knew some things about their personalities because both had taken my personality test, a series of questions I had devised to establish some basic things about a person&#x2019;s biological temperament. Both had told me their test results. And from these data, I was confident that Patrick&#x2019;s particular chemical profile would complement Suzanne&#x2019;s, creating a biological and psychological cocktail that would keep them captivated with each other for years.<br>Temperament and Love<br>We have many inborn tendencies. Indeed, scientists now believe some 50 percent of the variations in human personality are associated with genetic factors. We inherit much of the fabric of our mind.<br>But what is personality?<br>Psychologists define it as that distinct cluster of thoughts and feelings that color all of a person&#x2019;s actions.<br>Your personality is more than just your biology, of course. Personality is composed of two fundamentally different types of traits: those of character and those of temperament.<br>Your character traits stem from your experiences. Your childhood games; your parents&#x2019; interests and values; how people in your community express love and hate; what relatives and friends regard as polite, dangerous or exciting; how they worship; what they sing; when they laugh; what they do to make a living and relax&#x2014;these and innumerable other cultural forces combine to build your unique set of character traits.<br>The balance of your personality is your temperament, all of the biologically based tendencies you have inherited, traits that emerge in early childhood to produce your consistent patterns of feeling, thinking and behaving. As the Spanish philosopher Jos� Ortega y Gasset put it, &#x201c;I am, plus my circumstances.&#x201d; Temperament is the &#x201c;I am,&#x201d; the foundation of who you are. Curiosity; creativity; novelty seeking; compassion; cautiousness; competitiveness: to some degree, you inherit these and many other aspects of your disposition.<br>It is this part of the human spirit I had examined in Patrick and Suzanne&#x2014;their biological temperament.<br>Born &#x201c;Me&#x201d;<br>No one knows precisely how many traits of temperament we human beings inherit. But studies of identical twins suggest we inherit many. Take the &#x201c;giggle twins,&#x201d; as they were called by staff members of the Minnesota Twin Study in the 1970s because these women would erupt with peals of laughter at the slightest jest or odd turn of phrase.<br>Daphne and Barbara were born to an unmarried Finnish student living in England in 1939. Barbara was adopted by an English groundskeeper who worked in a public park, while Daphne grew up in the home of a wealthy metallurgist. Yet when they first came together again at age thirty-nine as part of the Minnesota Twin Study, which focused on identical twins reared apart, both loved good pranks and both had giggled all their lives. Both regularly sat on their hands to keep from nervously gesticulating. Both had dyed their hair auburn. Both were effusively energetic. Both hated math and sports. Both avoided commercial television. Both preferred the color blue. Both were unwilling to give any political opinions. And both had met their husbands at age sixteen at a town hall dance and married in the autumn. Their IQ scores were nearly identical, too, despite Daphne&#x2019;s expensive education and Barbara&#x2019;s far more modest schooling.<br>Coincidence?<br>Psychologist Thomas Bouchard, director of the Minnesota Twin Study, unearthed so many stories like this one that in the 1980s he proposed that dozens of personality traits have a degree of heritability. Among those with the strongest genetic links, he reported, were traditionalism, the willingness to capitulate to authority, aggressiveness, the drive to lead and the appetite for attention. As he wrote in 1984, &#x201c;Both the twin studies and the adoption studies converge on the surprising finding that common family environmental influences play only a minor role in the determination of personality.&#x201d;<br>In recent decades human behavior geneticists have added substantially to this list of traits linked with our DNA. More important to this book, scientists now know that groups of interacting genes influence behavior, even act together to create behavior syndromes. For example, if you have a biological appetite to seek novelty, you are also likely to be energetic, spontaneous, risk taking, curious and creative. If you are predisposed to be traditional instead, you are also likely to be loyal, cautious, respectful of authority and eager to make plans and follow schedules. We express constellations of related biological traits,1 creating what are commonly called personality types.2<br>In fact, after doing extensive research on the biological underpinnings of personality types, I have come to believe that each of us expresses a unique mix of four broad basic personality types. Moreover, our primary personality type steers us toward specific romantic partners. Our biological nature whispers constantly within us to influence who we love.<br>These thoughts and more were swimming through my mind as I blew those bubbles at Patrick and Suzanne on that enchanting wedding evening. I thought both had found their soul mate.<br>Who are you? Why are we naturally attracted to particular mates? My investigation of these mysteries started over the Christmas holiday in 2004.<br>Match.com<br>&#x201c;Why do you fall in love with one person rather than another?&#x201d; This is what the executive team at Match.com wanted to know when I met with them two days after Christmas 2004 in New York City. Match.com is the world&#x2019;s largest Internet dating site. And I had been invited to spend the day with them, thinking. Midmorning, they asked me this fundamental question.<br>&#x201c;No one really knows,&#x201d; I responded.<br>Psychologists have determined that men and women tend to fall in love with individuals from the same ethnic and socioeconomic background; with those of a similar level of intelligence, education and physical attractiveness; with individuals holding similar religious, political and social values; and with those who have a similar sense of humor. We also fall in love when the timing is right; and often with someone who lives or works nearby. Your childhood plays a huge role in your romantic choices, although no reliable patterns have ever been established. We tend to fall in love with someone who provides us with the things we need. And people often fall in love with those who are in love with them.<br>But, ...</p><h2>The Marne, 1914: The Opening of World War I and the Battle That Changed the World</h2><p>It is one of the essential events of military history, a cataclysmic encounter that prevented a quick German victory in World War I and changed the course of two wars and the world. Now, for the first time in a generation, here is a bold new account of the Battle of the Marne. A landmark work by a distinguished scholar, The Marne, 1914 gives, for the first time, all sides of the story. In remarkable detail, and with exclusive information based on newly unearthed documents, Holger H. Herwig superbly re-creates the dramatic battle, revealing how the German force was foiled and years of brutal trench warfare were made inevitable.<br><br>Herwig brilliantly reinterprets Germany&#x2019;s aggressive &#x201c;Schlieffen Plan&#x201d;&#x2013;commonly considered militarism run amok&#x2013;as a carefully crafted, years-in-the-making design to avoid a protracted war against superior coalitions. He also paints a new portrait of the run-up to the Marne: the Battle of the Frontiers, long thought a coherent assault but really a series of haphazard engagements that left &#x201c;heaps of corpses,&#x201d; France demoralized, Belgium in ruins, and Germany emboldened to take Paris.<br><br>Finally, Herwig puts in dazzling relief the Battle of the Marne itself: the French resolve to win, which included the exodus of 100,000 people from Paris (where even pigeons were placed under state control in case radio communications broke down), the crucial lack of coordination between Germany&#x2019;s First and Second Armies, and the fateful &#x201c;day of rest&#x201d; taken by the Third Army. He provides revelatory new facts about the all-important order of retreat by Germany&#x2019;s Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hentsch, previously an event hardly documented and here freshly reconstructed from diary excerpts.<br><br>Herwig also provides stunning cameos of all the important players: Germany&#x2019;s Chief of General Staff Helmuth von Moltke, progressively despairing and self-pitying as his plans go awry; his rival, France&#x2019;s Joseph Joffre, seemingly weak but secretly unflappable and steely; and Commander of the British Expeditionary Force John French, arrogant, combative, and mercurial.<br><b><br>The Marne, 1914 </b>puts into context the battle&#x2019;s rich historical significance: how it turned the war into a four-year-long fiasco that taught Europe to accept a new form of barbarism and stoked the furnace for the fires of World War II. Revelatory and riveting, this will be the new source on this seminal event.</p><p>Holger H.

Hamilton) <i>The Origins of World War I.</i><i>Chapter One</i><br>War: "Now or Never"<br><br>War is . . . an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will.&#x2014;carl von clausewitz<br><br>Since i have been at the foreign office," arthur nicolson noted at Whitehall in May 1914, "I have not seen such calm waters."1 Europe had, in fact, refused to tear itself to pieces over troubles in faraway lands: Morocco in 1905-06 and in 1911; Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908-09; Libya in 1911-12; and the Balkans in 1912-13. The Anglo- German naval arms race had subsided, as had the fears about the Berlin- to-Baghdad Railway, since Berlin had run out of money for such gargantuan enterprises. Russia had overcome its war with Japan (1904-05), albeit at a heavy price in terms of men and ships lost and domestic discontent. Few desolate strips of African or Asian lands remained to be contested, and Berlin and London were preparing to negotiate a "settlement" of the Portuguese colonies. France and Germany had not been at war for forty-three years and Britain and Russia for fifty-eight.<br><br>Partition of the Continent by 1907 into two nearly equal camps-the Triple Alliance of Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Italy, and the Triple Entente of Britain, France, and Russia-seemed to militate against metropolitan Europe being dragged into petty wars on its periphery. Kurt Riezler, foreign-policy adviser to German chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, cagily argued that given this model of great-power balance, future wars "would no longer be fought but calculated."2 Guns would no longer fire, "but have a voice in the negotiations." In other words, no power would risk escalating minor conflicts into a continental war; instead, each would "bluff" the adversary up the escalatory ladder, stopping just short of war in favor of diplomatic settlement. Peace seemed assured.<br><br>Domestically, for most well-off and law-abiding Europeans, the period prior to 1914 was a golden age of prosperity and decency. The "red specter" of Socialism had lost much of its threat. Real wages had shot up almost 50 percent between 1890 and 1913. Trade unions had largely won the right to collective bargaining, if not to striking, and their leaders sat in parliaments. Many workers had embraced social imperialism, believing that overseas trade and naval building translated into high-paying jobs at home. Germany had paved the path toward social welfare with state-sponsored health insurance, accident insurance, and old-age pensions. Others followed. Women were on the march for the vote. To be sure, there was trouble over Ireland, but then official London hardly viewed Ireland as a European matter.<br><br>Paris, as usual, was the exception. The capital had been seething with political excitement since January 1914, when Gaston Calmette, editor of Le Figaro, had launched a public campaign to discredit Finance Minister Joseph Caillaux-ostensibly over a new taxation bill.3 When Calmette published several letters from Caillaux's personal correspondence, Henriette Caillaux became alarmed. First, that correspondence could make public her husband's pacifist stance vis-�- vis Germany during the Second Moroccan Crisis in 1911; second, she knew that it included love letters from her to Joseph that showed she had conducted an affair with him at a time when he was still married. The elegant Madame Caillaux took matters into her own hands: On 16 March she walked into Calmette's office, drew a revolver from her muff, and shot the editor four times at point-blank range. Her trial on charges of murder dominated Paris in the summer of 1914. Two shots fired by a Serbian youth at Sarajevo on 28 June paled in comparison.<br><br>Gavrilo Princip's murder of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Habsburg throne, and his morganatic wife, Sophie Chotek, caused no immediate crisis in the major capitals. The dog days of summer were upon Europe. There ensued a mad rush to escape urban heat for cooler climes.4 French president Raymond Poincar� and prime minister Ren� Viviani were preparing to board the battleship France for a leisurely cruise through the Baltic Sea to meet Tsar Nicholas II at St. Petersburg. Kaiser Franz Joseph took the waters at Bad Ischl. Wilhelm II was about to board the royal yacht Hohenzollern for his annual cruise of the Norwegian fjords. Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg was off to the family estate at Hohenfinow to play Beethoven on the grand piano and to read Plato (in the original Greek). Foreign Minister Gottlieb von Jagow saw no need to curtail his honeymoon at Lucerne.<br><br>Nor were military men much concerned. German chief of the General Staff Helmuth von Moltke struck out for Karlsbad, Bohemia, to meet his Austro-Hungarian counterpart, Franz Conrad von H�tzendorf. War Minister Erich von Falkenhayn was off to vacation in the East Frisian Islands. Navy Secretary Alfred von Tirpitz left Berlin for St. Blasien, in the Black Forest. Habsburg war minister Alexander von Krobatin took the cure at Bad Gastein.<br><br>Even the less prominent escaped the July heat. Sigmund and Martha Freud, like Moltke and Conrad, vacationed at Karlsbad. V. I. Lenin left Cracow to hike in the Tatra Mountains. Leon Trotsky took solace in a small apartment in the Vienna Woods. Adolf Hitler was back in Munich after a military court-martial at Salzburg had found the draft dodger unfit for military service ("too weak; incapable of bearing arms").5<br><br>But had the exodus of European leaders been all that innocent? Or had some deeper design lain at its root? The first move in what is popularly called the July Crisis rested with Vienna. Few in power lamented the passing of Franz Ferdinand. He was too Catholic; he detested the Czechs, Magyars, and Poles within the empire; and he distrusted the ally in Rome. But the spilling of royal blood demanded an official response.<br><br>for more than half a dozen years prior to 1914, Conrad von H�tzendorf had pressed war on his government as the only solution to the perceived decline of the multinational Austro-Hungarian Empire. Daily, the frail, thin, crew-cut chief of the General Staff had stood at his desk and drafted contingency war plans against "Austria's congenital foes" Italy and Serbia as well as against Albania, Montenegro, and Russia, or against combinations of these states. Each year, he had submitted them to Kaiser Franz Joseph and to Foreign Minister Aloys Lexa Count Aehrenthal. And each year, these two had steadfastly refused to act.<br><br>Why, then, was July 1914 different?6 Conrad saw the murders at Sarajevo as a Serbian declaration of war. He cared little about the high school lads who had carried out the plot and about the secret organization "Union or Death," or the "Black Hand," that had planned it; his real enemy was Belgrade. He was determined not to let the last opportunity pass by "to settle accounts" with Serbia. He was haunted by the empire's failure to use the annexationist crisis over Bosnia- Herzegovina in 1908-09 to crush Serbian annexationist aspirations. There was also a personal motive: He informed his mistress Virginie "Gina" von Reininghaus that he was anxious to return from a war "crowned with success" so that he could "claim" her "as my dearest wife." Honor was at stake as well. While the war might be a "hopeless struggle" against overwhelming odds, Conrad informed Gina on the day of the Sarajevo killings, it had to be fought "because such an ancient monarchy and such an ancient army cannot perish ingloriously."7 In a nutshell, Conrad's position in July 1914, in the words of the new foreign minister, Leopold Count Berchtold, was simply: "War, war, war."8<br><br>By 1914, Franz Joseph shared Conrad's "war at any price" mind-set. Serbian arrogance had to be rooted out, by force if necessary. The kaiser was plagued by nightmares-of Solferino, where in 1859 he had led Austrian armies to defeat at the hands of France and Piedmont- Sardinia; and of K�niggr�tz, where in 1866 his forces had been routed by those of King Wilhelm I of Prussia. Thus in July 1914, Franz Joseph was prepared to draw the sword. Honor demanded no less. "If we must go under," he confided to Conrad, "we better go under decently."9<br><br>That left the foreign minister. In the past, Berchtold, like Aehrenthal, had resisted Conrad's demands for war. But diplomacy had brought no security. Thus, Berchtold, emboldened by the hard-line stance of a small cohort of hawks at the Foreign Office, endorsed military measures. Just two days after the Sarajevo murders, he spoke of the need for a "final and fundamental reckoning" with Serbia.10 And he worked out a set of assumptions to underpin his decision: Early and decisive action by Berlin would deter possible Russian intervention and "localize" the war in the Balkans.<br><br>But would Berlin play the role of gallant second? During past Balkan crises, Wilhelm II and his advisers had refused to back Habsburg initiatives with military force. Would July 1914 confirm that pattern? Berchtold, knowing that he needed diplomatic and military backing from Berlin, on 4 July dispatched Alexander Count Hoyos, his chef de cabinet, to sound out what the German position would be in the event that Vienna took actions to "eliminate" Serbia as a "political power factor in the Balkans."11 It was a clever move, given the kaiser's well-known propensity for personal diplomacy. In meetings the next two days with Wilhelm II, Bethmann Hollweg, Falkenhayn, and Undersecretary of the Foreign Office Arthur Zimmermann, Hoyos and Habsburg ambassador L�szl� Count Sz�gy�ny-Marich obtained promises of "full German backing" for whatever action Vienna took against Belgrade. There was no time to lose. "The present situation," the kaiser noted, "is so favorable to us." Diplomats and soldiers "considered the question of Russian intervention and accepted the risk of a g...</p><h2>Singer Sewing Book</h2><p>Two Singer employees discuss the fundamentals of sewing and offer advice on colors, fabrics, patterns, and the use of machine accessories</p><p></p><h2>Live Pain Free Without Drugs or Surgery: How to use Integrated Positional Therapy to eliminate chronic pain</h2><p><p><b>Reduce or Eliminate Chronic Muscular Pain With These Gentle Exercises</b></p><p><strong><em>Live Pain-free Without Drugs or Surgery</em> offers a practical, proven, easy-to-follow program (Integrated Positional Therapy) to reduce and even eliminate chronic muscular pain in only minutes a day through simple exercises and movements that anyone can do.</strong></p><p>Developed by neuromuscular therapist Lee Albert, NMT, Integrated Positional Therapy (IPT) incorporates techniques such as Strain/Counter-strain, Muscle Energy Technique, stretching and home care to re-align the body&#x2019;s structure and relieve pain caused by structural imbalances.

It addresses the cause of your symptoms.</b> Is stopping your symptoms with drugs in any way addressing the cause of those symptoms? Or is it just expedient to hide the pain with drugs while you continue to make your problem worse? This book provides some of the very best solutions! Putting off recovery can push you past the point of no return. Covering up the symptoms with drugs can allow the problem to become permanent or even harder to heal. And often - yes, often, surgery does not cure. These carefully worked out solutions allow the body to resume the correct alignment thus opening up nerve routes, relieving muscle spasms and increasing local blood flow. You'll learn to use your body correctly and allow it to heal itself. The point is for you not to endure or cover up the pain, tingling and numbness but to give the body what it needs to be self-correcting, to stop the cause of the symptoms (much of it just shifting habits)."<br>-Maggie Lettvin, beloved exercise guru from PBS's "The Beautiful Machine"</p><h2>Forgot Your Password?

Chaplin&#39;s film career as the Little Tramp adored by the whole world is the stuff of legend, but this frank autobiography shows another side. Born into a theatrical family, Chaplin&#39;s father died of drink while his mother, unable to bear the poverty, suffered from bouts of insanity. From a childhood of grinding poverty in the south London slums, Chaplin found an escape in his early debut on the music hall stage, followed by his lucky break in America, the founding of United Artists with D.W. Griffith and Douglas Fairbanks, the struggle to maintain artistic control over his work, the string of failed marriages, and his eventual exile from Hollywood after personal scandals and persecution for his left-wing politics during the McCarthy Era. Sir Charles &#39;Charlie&#39; Chaplin (1895-1976) was born in Walworth, London. Best known for his work in silent film, his most famous role was The Little Tramp, a universally recognisable and iconic character who appeared in films such as The Kid (1921), The Gold Rush (1925) and City Lights (1931). His other films include Modern Times (1936), a commentary on the Great Depression, and The Great Dictator (1940), a satirical attack on Hitler and the Nazis.

Sweeping double-page spreads usually focus on Anthony's public and personal lives, but there is one dramatic spread showing slaves and soldiers marching under a golden sky with a petition for abolition in the foreground.

Its nuanced seasonings, elegant presentations, and resourceful use of exotic ingredients elevates vegan food to the level of fine dining, while the landmark MILLENNIUM COOKBOOK proves you don't need meat and dairy to make delicious, satisfying gourmet dishes at home.<br><br>In THE ARTFUL VEGAN, chefs Eric Tucker, Bruce Enloe, and Amy Pearce present 140 new impassioned interpretations of global cuisine, spanning influences from the Pacific Rim to the Deep South. Showcasing an innovative repertoire of flavors, methods, and ingredients on the cutting edge of healthful taste and nutrition, these sumptuous recipes attest to the endless possibilities of all-organic vegan cooking. Here's a taste:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Lemon-Pine Nut Ravioli over Baby Artichoke-Golden Tomato Rago <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Oyster Mushroom Calamari <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Stuffed Poblano Chiles over Forbidden Black Rice Risotto <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Strawberry, Rose, and Rhubarb Soup <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;German Chocolate Cake<br><br>All the recipes are cholesterol free, and many are low in fat or can be made with little or no oil. Whether you're a strict herbivore or simply interested in exploring a dynamic new cuisine, the food of Millennium will open your mind-and palate-to a world of enticing vegan flavors.</p><p>AMY PEARCE was born and raised in Mobile, Alabama. For as long as she can remember, she has loved to bake. When she became a vegetarian at the age of 12, she was forced to learn to cook for herself. In 1995, Amy graduated from the Natural Gourmet Cookery School in New York. She worked numerous jobs as a vegan baker and private chef before joining the Millennium team in 1999. She soon became the restaurant s pastry chef.<br>ERIC TUCKER has been executive chef at Millennium since it opened in 1994, and was coauthor of the revolutionary MILLENNIUM COOKBOOK. He is a graduate of the Natural Gourmet Institute of Food in New York. In 1990, he took a position at Milly&#x2019;s Restaurant in San Rafael, California. When the owners of Milly&#x2019;s opened Millennium in San Francisco, he came along as executive chef, bringing to the restaurant his varied culinary passions, including mycology and exotic cuisines. He has been the primary creative force behind the restaurant&#x2019;s success ever since. <br>BRUCE ENLOE was born into a family of food lovers and restaurateurs in Bryan, Texas. He has spent more than fifteen years in various kitchens, with a focus on Italian, Texan, Southern, and Southwestern cooking. He joined Millennium in 1997 and became sous-chef in 1998. As assistant wine steward, he helped build the widely recognized organic wine list. Millennium introduced Bruce to his wife and best friend, former assistant general manager Nicole LeBlanc. They left the Bay Area in 2003 to travel, with plans to open an organic foods restaurant in Ontario, Canada.In stark contrast to some traditional vegan cookbooks, which feature dishes like lentil burgers and bulgur salad, the Millennium Restaurant's second cookbook pushes the boundaries of vegan cuisine, offering extravagant recipes for dishes such as Stuffed Poblano Chilies over Forbidden Black Rice Risotto with Roasted Corn-Avocado Abdi. Though Tucker, Millennium's executive chef, encourages readers to "dissect our dissections... to take apart our dishes, simplify them," his recipes are often too complex to be realistic for most home cooks. Caramelized Three Onion and Porcini Cappuccino with Truffled Soy Foam calls for an espresso machine, for example, and Quick Pickled Oranges requires access to impeccable produce; the recipe did not work well with standard supermarket citrus. What the San Francisco restaurant really offers is inspiration to readers interested in cutting-edge vegan and raw-food cuisine. Recipes like Portobello Carpaccio over Carrot and Parsnip Fettuccine with Raw Pumpkin Seed-Ancho Chile Pesto should delight vegetarians looking for new flavor combinations. And Pearce's desserts shine-her lavish use of cashews and coconut milk offers a richness usually absent from vegan treats. The authors also provide information about organic wines and vegan substitutes, detailed nutritional information for each recipe and translations of traditional high cuisine dishes, like steak au poivre, to vegan, seasonal styles (e.g. Fauxlet au Poivre). With its complex recipes and enticing color photographs, this book is a welcome and needed addition to any library of modern cuisine. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Honey in the Horn</h2><p>Honey In The Horn</p><p>Set in Oregon in the early years of the twentieth century, H.

Klein's first book may not have created the fuss that <i>Primary Colors</i> did, but it attracted the attention of no less a celebrity than Bruce Springsteen, who used to cite it with respect during concerts before singing Guthrie's most famous lyric, "This Land Is Your Land." Klein's unearthing of two politically radical verses usually omitted from that song is just one instance of the solid research underpinning his vivid narrative of Guthrie's often tragic life (1912-67). Before Woody turned 15, his sister died in a fire and his mother was committed to an Oklahoma insane asylum with a mysterious disease he later learned he inherited; Klein's chilling description of Huntington's chorea is one of the book's strong points. Its heart is a full rendering of Guthrie's restless wanderings across Depression-era America, which fired his lifelong radicalism, and a scrupulously unsentimental account of Woody's oft-sentimentalized personality. He may have been a genius and a staunch advocate of the common people, but Guthrie was also a bad husband, neglectful father, and difficult friend, as Klein shows. He pays Woody's life and music the tribute of assuming they need no sanitizing, and this biography is all the more interesting because of it. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><b>Joe Klein</b>, a journalist for nearly three decades, is a political correspondent for <i>Time </i>magazine<i>.</i>&nbsp;In addition to&nbsp;<i>Primary Colors</i>, his previous books include&nbsp;<i>Payback: Five Marines After Vietnam</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Woody Guthrie: A Life.&nbsp;</i>He has written articles and reviews for&nbsp;<i>The New Republic</i>,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times,&nbsp;The Washington Post,&nbsp;Life</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Rolling Stone.</i></p><h2>1775: A Good Year for Revolution</h2><p><b>The contrarian historian and analyst upends the conventional reading of the American Revolution</b><br><br>In <i>1775</i>, iconoclastic historian and bestselling author Kevin Phillips punctures the myth that 1776 was the watershed year of the American Revolution. He suggests that the great events and confrontations of 1775&#x2014;Congress&#x2019;s belligerent economic ultimatums to Britain, New England&#x2019;s <i>rage militaire</i>, the exodus of British troops and expulsion of royal governors up and down the seaboard, and the new provincial congresses and hundreds of local&nbsp; committees that quickly reconstituted local authority in Patriot hands�&#x2014;achieved a&nbsp; sweeping Patriot control of territory and local government that Britain was never able to overcome.&nbsp; These each added to the Revolution&#x2019;s essential momentum so when the British finally attacked in great strength the following year, they could not regain the control they had lost in 1775.<br><br>Analyzing the political climate, economic structures, and military preparations, as well as the roles of ethnicity, religion, and class, Phillips tackles the eighteenth century with the same skill and insights he has shown in analyzing contemporary politics and economics.&nbsp; The result is a dramatic narrative brimming with original insights. <i>1775</i> revolutionizes our understanding of America&#x2019;s origins.</p><p>Kevin Phillips has been a political and an economic commentator for four decades. This is his fifteenth book. The predecessor to this book,<i> The Cousins&#x2019; Wars</i>, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 1999. He lives in Connecticut.The year 1776 is often described as the year of this country&#x2019;s birth. That is, of course, technically true. But Phillips, the acclaimed political analyst and historian, convincingly illustrates that it was in 1775 that the critical trends and events unfolded, so that our declared independence was a confirmation of facts already established on the ground: the lower houses of colonial legislatures had aggressively gained control, often driving out royal governors; the rhetoric of the Second Continental Congress became strident, even bellicose; and increasingly, that congress assumed the powers of a government. On a local level, various Patriot Committees enforced boycotts of British-made goods and made the lives of those deemed Tories very uncomfortable. Vast stretches of the Atlantic seaboard were &#x201c;no go&#x201d; areas for British troops. Independence was probably in the thoughts, if not on the lips, of many Americans by the end of the year. Phillips writes in a methodical and cooly dispassionate style, so those expecting a tribute to the &#x201c;glorious cause&#x201d; should look elsewhere. But he does provide a solid, well-argued, and informative re-examination of our beginnings as a nation-state. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Vol. 1</h2><p>SAKURA AND SYAORAN RETURN!<br><br>But they&#x2019;re not the people you know. Sakura is the princess of Clow&#x2014;and possessor of a mysterious, misunderstood power that promises to change the world. Syaoran is her childhood friend and leader of the archaeological dig that took his father&#x2019;s life. They reside in an alternate reality . . . where whatever you least expect can happen&#x2014;<i>and does</i>. When Sakura ventures to the dig site to declare her love for Syaoran, a puzzling symbol is uncovered&#x2014;which triggers a remarkable quest. Now Syaoran embarks upon a desperate journey through other worlds&#x2014;all in the name of saving Sakura.<br><br><b>Includes special extras after the story!<br></b></p><p>In the mythical land of Clow, the brilliant but romantically clueless teenager Syaoran is working on an archeological dig, while his friend Princess Sakura works up the courage to tell him she loves him. Unfortunately, just as she's about to, a mysterious symbol robs her of her memories and scatters them across countless parallel worlds. What follows next is no surprise: Syaoran vows to restore her memories and embarks on a quest, joined by a wizard, a ninja and a Pok�mon-like creature. In this first volume, the motley group finds itself negotiating with an interdimensional witch and visiting the Hanshin Republic, a parallel world obsessed with Japan's perennially second-place baseball team. While Clamp (the Japanese collective of women manga creators) has pitched this workas a more sophisticated take on its source material (the <i>Cardcaptor Sakura </i>series), the art is stereotypical manga: lithe figures, occasionally confusing layouts and lots of cutesy chibi figures. Alas, the writing is equally confusing. Characters appear and disappear with great fanfare but little foundation, and if the dramatis personae "scorecard" in the back of the book is any indication, half of the central ragtag fellowship aren't even characters in the series. Still, Clamp taps into some story lines that are likely to pay off. Fans of <i>Cardcaptor Sakura</i> will enjoy this; everyone else will be left scratching their heads. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When he looked at his own industry, however, he saw that the media far too often ignored their primary mission: to provide objective, disinterested reporting. Again and again he saw that the news slanted to the left. For years, Goldberg appealed to reporters, producers, and network executives for more balanced reporting, but no one listened. The liberal bias continued.<br><br>Now, breaking ranks and naming names, he reveals a corporate news culture in which the closed-mindedness is breathtaking and in which entertainment wins over hard news every time.<br></p><p>Bernard Goldberg is the winner of seven Emmy Awards, and was once rated by TV Guide as one of the ten most interesting people on television. Having served for nearly thirty years as a reporter and producer for CBS News, he now reports for the critically acclaimed HBO program Real Sports, hosted by Bryant Gumbel. He has written for the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Goldberg lives with his family in Miami.<br>"This insider&#x2019;s account of Mr. Goldberg&#x2019;s career at CBS is filled with so many stories of repulsive elitism and prejudice on the part of his peers that it elevates Bias to must-read status. . . .

I raise a window for some spring Palo Alto air, but it doesn&#x2019;t help. In bed, eyes open, I hear whispers, which makes me think of the president, because we often talk in whispers. I know the whispering sound is really just my wife, Charlotte, who listens to Nirvana on her headphones all night and tends to sleep-�mumble the lyrics. Charlotte has her own bed, a mechanical one.<br><br>My sleep problem is this: when I close my eyes, I keep visualizing my wife killing herself. More like the ways she might try to kill herself, since she&#x2019;s paralyzed from the shoulders down. The paralysis is quite temporary, though good luck trying to convince Charlotte of that. She slept on her side today, to fight the bedsores, and there was something about the way she stared at the safety rail at the edge of the mattress. The bed is voice-�activated, so if she could somehow get her head between the bars of the safety rail, &#x201c;incline&#x201d; is all she&#x2019;d have to say. As the bed powered up, she&#x2019;d be choked in seconds. And then there&#x2019;s the way she stares at the looping cable that descends from the Hoyer Lift, which swings her in and out of bed.<br><br>But my wife doesn&#x2019;t need an exotic exit strategy, not when she&#x2019;s exacted a promise from me to help her do it when the time comes.<br><br>I rise and go to her, but she&#x2019;s not listening to Nirvana yet&#x2014;�she tends to save it for when she needs it most, after midnight, when her nerves really start to crackle.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought I heard a noise,&#x201d; I tell her. &#x201c;Kind of a whisper.&#x201d;<br><br>Short, choppy hair frames her drawn face, skin faint as refrigerator light.<br><br>&#x201c;I heard it, too,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>In the silver dish by her voice remote is a half-�smoked joint. I light it for her and hold it to her lips.<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the weather in there?&#x201d; I ask.<br><br>&#x201c;Windy,&#x201d; she says through the smoke.<br><br>Windy is better than hail or lightning or, God forbid, flooding, which is the sensation she felt when her lungs were just starting to work again. But there are different kinds of wind.<br><br>I ask, &#x201c;Windy like a whistle through window screens, or windy like the rattle of storm shutters?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A strong breeze, hissy and buffeting, like a microphone in the wind.&#x201d;<br><br>She smokes again. Charlotte hates being stoned, but she says it quiets the inside of her. She has Guillain-�Barr� syndrome, a condition in which her immune system attacks the insulation around her nerves so that when the brain sends signals to the body, the electrical impulses ground out before they can be received. A billion nerves inside her send signals that go everywhere, nowhere. This is the ninth month, a month that is at the edge of the medical literature. It&#x2019;s a place where the doctors no longer feel qualified to tell us whether Charlotte&#x2019;s nerves will begin to regenerate or she will be stuck like this forever.<br><br>She exhales, coughing. Her right arm twitches, which means her brain has attempted to tell her arm to rise and cover the mouth. She tokes again, and through the smoke she says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m worried.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re worried about me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I want you to stop talking to the president. It&#x2019;s time to accept reality.&#x201d;<br><br>I try to be lighthearted. &#x201c;But he&#x2019;s the one who talks to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then stop listening. He&#x2019;s gone. When your time comes, you&#x2019;re supposed to fall silent.&#x201d;<br><br>Reluctantly, I nod. But she doesn&#x2019;t understand. Stuck in this bed, having sworn off TV, she&#x2019;s probably the only person in America who didn&#x2019;t see the assassination. If she&#x2019;d beheld the look in the president&#x2019;s eyes when his life was taken, she&#x2019;d understand why I talk to him late at night. If she could leave this room and feel the nation trying to grieve, she&#x2019;d know why I reanimated the commander in chief and brought him back to life.<br><br>&#x201c;Concerning my conversations with the president,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;I just want to point out that you spend a third of your life listening to Nirvana, whose songs are by a guy who blew his brains out.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlotte tilts her head and looks at me like I&#x2019;m a stranger. &#x201c;Kurt Cobain took the pain of his life and made it into something that mattered. What did the president leave behind? Uncertainties, emptiness, a thousand rocks to overturn.&#x201d;<br><br>She talks like that when she&#x2019;s high. I tap out the joint and lift her headphones.<br><br>&#x201c;Ready for your Nirvana?&#x201d; I ask.<br><br>She looks toward the window. &#x201c;That sound, I hear it again,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>At the window, I peer out into the darkness. It&#x2019;s a normal Palo Alto night&#x2014;�the hiss of sprinklers, blue recycling bins, a raccoon digging in the community garden. Then I notice it, right before my eyes, a small black drone, hovering. Its tiny servos swivel to regard me. Real quick, I snatch the drone out of the air and pull it inside. I close the window and curtains, then study the thing: its shell is made of black foil stretched over tiny struts, like the bones of a bat&#x2019;s wing. Behind a propeller of clear cellophane, a tiny infrared engine throbs with warmth.<br><br>&#x201c;Now will you listen to me?&#x201d; Charlotte asks. &#x201c;Now will you stop this president business?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s too late for that,&#x201d; I tell her, and release the drone. As if blind, it bumbles around the room. Is it autonomous? Has someone been operating it, someone watching our house? I lift it from its column of air and flip off its power switch.<br><br>Charlotte looks toward her voice remote. &#x201c;Play music,&#x201d; she tells it.<br><br>Closing her eyes, she waits for me to place the headphones on her ears, where she will hear Kurt Cobain come to life once more.<br><br>I wake later in the night. The drone has somehow turned itself on and is hovering above my body, mapping me with a beam of soft red light. I toss a sweater over it, dropping it to the floor. After making sure Charlotte is asleep, I pull out my iProjector. I turn it on, and the president appears in three dimensions, his torso life-�size in an amber glow.<br><br>He greets me with a smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to be back in Palo Alto,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>My algorithm has accessed the iProjector&#x2019;s GPS chip and searched the president&#x2019;s database for location references. This one came from a commencement address he gave at Stanford back when he was a senator.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. President,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to bother you again, but I have more questions.&#x201d;<br><br>He looks into the distance, contemplative. &#x201c;Shoot,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>I move into his line of sight but can&#x2019;t get him to look me in the eye. That&#x2019;s one of the design problems I ran across.<br><br>&#x201c;Did I make a mistake in creating you, in releasing you into the world?&#x201d; I ask. &#x201c;My wife says that you&#x2019;re keeping people from mourning, that this you keeps us from accepting the fact that the real you is gone.&#x201d;<br><br>The president rubs the stubble on his chin. He looks down and away.<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t put the genie back in the bottle,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>Which is eerie, because that&#x2019;s a line he spoke on 60 Minutes, a moment when he expressed regret for legalizing drones for civilian use.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know that I&#x2019;m the one who made you?&#x201d; I ask.<br><br>&#x201c;We are all born free,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;And no person may traffic in another.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you weren&#x2019;t born,&#x201d; I tell him. &#x201c;I wrote an algorithm based on the Linux operating kernel. You&#x2019;re an open-�source search engine married to a dialog bot and a video compiler. The program scrubs the Web and archives a person&#x2019;s images and videos and data&#x2014;�everything you say, you&#x2019;ve said before.&#x201d;<br><br>For the first time, the president falls silent.<br><br>I ask, &#x201c;Do you know that you&#x2019;re gone . . . that you&#x2019;ve died?&#x201d;<br><br>The president doesn&#x2019;t hesitate. &#x201c;The end of life is another kind of freedom,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>The assassination flashes in my eyes. I&#x2019;ve seen the video so many times&#x2014;�the motorcade slowly crawls along while the president, on foot, parades past the barricaded crowds. Someone in the throng catches the president&#x2019;s eye. The president turns, lifts a hand in greeting. Then a bullet strikes him in the abdomen. The impact bends him forward, his eyes lift to confront the shooter. A look of recognition settles into the president&#x2019;s gaze&#x2014;�of a particular person, of some kind of truth, of something he has foreseen? He takes the second shot in the face. You can see the switch go off&#x2014;�his limbs give and he&#x2019;s down. They put him on a machine for a few days, but the end had already come.<br><br>I glance at Charlotte, asleep. &#x201c;Mr. President,&#x201d; I whisper, &#x201c;did you and the first lady ever talk about the future, about worst-�case scenarios?&#x201d;<br><br>I wonder if the first lady was the one to turn off the machine.<br><br>The president smiles. &#x201c;The first lady and I have a wonderful relationship. We share everything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But were there instructions? Did you two make a plan?&#x201d;<br><br>His voice lowers, becomes sonorous. &#x201c;Are you asking about bonds of matrimony?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose so,&#x201d; I say.<br><br>&#x201c;In this regard,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;our only duty is to be of service in any way we can.&#x201d;<br><br>My mind ponders the ways in which I might have to be of service to Charlotte.<br><br>The president then looks into the distance, as if a flag is waving there.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the president of the United States,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;and I approved this message.&#x201d;<br><br>That&#x2019;s when I know our conversation is over. When I reach to turn off the iProjector, the president looks me squarely in the eye, a coincidence of perspective, I guess. We regard each other, his eyes deep and melancholy, and my finger hesitates at the switch.<br><br>&#x201c;Seek your inner resolve,&#x201d; he tells me.<br><br>Can you tell a story that doesn&#x2019;t begin, it&#x2019;s just suddenly happening? The woman you love gets the flu. Her fingers tingle, her legs go rubbery. Soon she can&#x2019;t grip a coffee cup. What finally gets her to the hospital is the need to pee. She&#x2019;s dying to pee, but the paralysis has begun: the bladder can no longer hear the brain. After an ER doc inserts a Foley catheter, you learn new words&#x2014;�axon, areflexia, ascending peripheral polyneuropathy.<br><br>Charlotte says she&#x2019;s filled with &#x201c;noise.&#x201d; Inside her is a &#x201c;storm.&#x201d;<br><br>The doctor has a big needle. He tells Charlotte to get on the gurney. Charlotte is scared to get on the gurney. She&#x2019;s scared she won&#x2019;t ever get up again. &#x201c;Please, honey,&#x201d; you say. &#x201c;Get on the gurney.&#x201d; Soon you behold the glycerin glow of your wife&#x2019;s spinal fluid. And she&#x2019;s right. She doesn&#x2019;t get up again.<br><br>Next comes plasmapheresis, then high-�dose immunoglobulin therapy.<br><br>The doctors mention, casually, the word ventilator.<br><br>Charlotte&#x2019;s mother arrives. She brings her cello. She&#x2019;s an expert on the siege of Leningrad. She has written a book on the topic. When Charlotte&#x2019;s coma is induced, her mother fills the neuro ward with the saddest sounds ever conceived. For days, there is nothing but the swish of vent baffles, the trill of vital monitors, and Shostakovich, Shostakovich, Shostako�vich.<br><br>Two months of physical therapy in Santa Clara. Here are dunk tanks, sonar stimulators, exoskeletal treadmills. Charlotte becomes the person in the room who makes the victims of other afflictions feel better about their fate. She does not make progress, she&#x2019;s not a &#x201c;soldier&#x201d; or a &#x201c;champ&#x201d; or a &#x201c;trouper.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlotte convinces herself that I will leave her for one of the nurses in the rehab ward. She screams at me to get a vasectomy so this nurse and I will suffer a barren future. To soothe her, I read aloud Joseph Heller&#x2019;s memoir about contracting Guillain-�Barr� syndrome. The book was supposed to make us feel better. Instead, it chronicles how great Heller&#x2019;s friends are, how high Heller&#x2019;s spirits are, how Heller leaves his wife to marry the beautiful nurse who tends to him. And for Charlotte, the book&#x2019;s ending is particularly painful: Joseph Heller gets better.<br><br>We tumble into a well of despair that&#x2019;s narrow and deep, a place that seals us off. Everything is in the well with us&#x2014;�careers, goals, travel, children&#x2014;�so close that we can drown them to save ourselves.<br><br>Finally, discharge. Yet home is unexpectedly surreal. Amid familiar surroundings, the impossibility of normal life is amplified. But the cat is happy, so happy to have Charlotte home that it spends an entire night curled on Charlotte&#x2019;s throat, on her tracheal incision. Goodbye, cat! While I&#x2019;m in the garage, Charlotte watches a spider slowly descend from the ceiling on a single thread. She tries to blow it away. She blows and blows, but the spider disappears into her hair.<br><br>Still to be described are tests, tantrums and treatments. To come are the discoveries of Kurt Cobain and marijuana. Of these times, there is only one moment I must relate. It was a normal night. I was beside Charlotte in the mechanical bed, holding up her magazine.<br><br>She said, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know how bad I want to get out of this bed.&#x201d;<br><br>Her voice was quiet, uninflected.

What at first seemed easily treatable turned out not to be, and she found herself in what Montaigne &#x2013; the writer she turns to for wisdom -- called &#x201c;suspicious country&#x201d;: a place where death might be just around the corner. In <em>The Bright Hour</em>, the book Riggs wrote during her ultimately terminal illness, she maps that country, determined to see what is lovely in the landscape: her sweet, expressive little boys, her husband, who is honest and funny whenever possible, and her circle of family and friends, some of whom are also going through treatment for cancer. Riggs&#x2019;s great-great-great grandfather was the poet-philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson (referred to here as RWE for short) and Riggs herself displays a formidable gift for language and a light but honest touch with the often -- but not always -- dark emotions evoked by her situation. To call a book so lovely and sad this year&#x2019;s <em>When Breath Becomes Air</em>, would not be inaccurate, but would not do it justice. <em>--Sarah Harrison Smith, The Amazon Book Review</em>Nina Riggs received her MFA in poetry in 2004 and published a book of poems, <i>Lucky, Lucky</i>, in 2009. She wrote about life with metastatic breast cancer on her blog, <i>Suspicious Country</i>; her recent work has appeared in <i>The Washington Post </i>and <i>The New York</i> <i>Times. </i>She lived with her husband and sons and dogs in Greensboro, North Carolina.

Even though I should.&#x201d;<br><br>What&#x2019;s the proper response to something like that?<br><br>&#x201c;Gee thanks, appreciate the discretion.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hope you don&#x2019;t change your mind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm. Sounds like you&#x2019;re feeling . . . homicidal.&#x201d;<br><br>When in doubt, say nothing. My job features doubt on a daily basis, but it&#x2019;s good advice for anyone.<br><br>I sat in my chair and crossed my legs in order to appear unperturbed and continued to look into the eyes of the person who&#x2019;d just threatened my life. In return, I received a serene stare. Not a flicker of regret in the flat brown eyes. Just the opposite: icy contentment.<br><br>I&#x2019;d seen the same creepy, inanimate confidence in the eyes of psychopaths locked up in supermax cells. The person across the room had never been arrested.<br><br>None of the usual warning signs had been present. No delusions or command hallucinations, none of the bizarre mannerisms or twitchy volatility that can result from too many crossed wires. No seepage of testosterone leading to unbridled violence.<br><br>The person who&#x2019;d just threatened my life didn&#x2019;t have much in the way of testosterone.<br><br>Her name was Constance Sykes and she preferred to be called Connie. She was forty-four years old, medium build, medium height, blond turning to gray, with a handsome, square-jawed face, a mellow voice, and perfect posture. She&#x2019;d been a straight-A student, had earned a B.A. in chemistry, Phi Beta Kappa, summa cum laude, followed by an M.D. at a top medical school, then a prestigious internship and residency and board certification in pathology.<br><br>She owned and operated a small, private lab in the Valley that specialized in testing for sexually transmitted diseases and arcane infections, drove a Lexus, and lived in a house far too large for one person. Most people would call her wealthy; she described her financial status as &#x201c;comfortable.&#x201d;<br><br>Every time I&#x2019;d seen her, including this morning, she&#x2019;d been well groomed and dressed in quietly fashionable clothing. She wore jewelry but if you spent enough time with her, she&#x2019;d inevitably remove bracelets and brooches and earrings and stare at them as if they were bits of alien flotsam. Then she&#x2019;d put them back on, frowning, as if the notion of embellishment was a nuisance but also a responsibility and she was no shirker.<br><br>She had her issues, but nothing that had predicted this.<br><br>A self-professed loner, Connie Sykes seemed at ease with never having lived with anyone since leaving home for college. Matter-of-factly, she&#x2019;d let me know she was an expert on self-sustenance, had never needed or wanted or imagined another person in her life.<br><br>Until &#x201c;the baby&#x201d; came along.<br><br>She hadn&#x2019;t gestated the baby or given birth to the baby but she wanted the baby, felt she deserved to have the baby, had gone to considerable effort and expense to get the baby.<br><br>That quest had been doomed from the outset, with or without my input, but I&#x2019;d been paid to offer an expert opinion on her case and Connie Sykes had just learned that she&#x2019;d most certainly fail in her claim and she was unaccustomed to losing and someone needed to be blamed.<br><br>She&#x2019;d stirred up needless pain but I felt some sympathy for her. My best friend, a gay homicide detective, describes psychologists as reflexive yeah-sayers. (&#x201c;Forget Dr. No. You&#x2019;re Dr. Sure-no-problem.&#x201d;) Of course, he&#x2019;s right. If therapists enjoyed deprivation and prohibition, we&#x2019;d have studied for the clergy or run for office.<br><br>I figured if Connie Sykes called, I&#x2019;d do my best to offer support, maybe smooth the edges.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t. She just showed up. I had time so I led her to the office.<br><br>She entered no differently than before. Settling, straight-backed, butt barely perched on the battered leather sofa the way she always did. Removing her glasses, she placed them in a hard leather case that she dropped into her fine, oversized, Italian drawstring purse and smiled.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;Morning.&#x201d;<br><br>She said, &#x201c;Is it?&#x201d;<br><br>Then her smile died and she cleared her throat, as if preparing to deliver a well-rehearsed speech, and informed me that she wasn&#x2019;t going to ready-aim-fire in my direction. Even though she should.<br><br>I kept my mouth shut, figured I was coming across calm as the two of us danced the eyeball tango.<br><br>Connie Sykes broke first, smoothing her black gabardine slacks and stroking her purse&#x2019;s whiskey-colored leather. Tapping the bag, she ran her finger over a swell in the leather and smiled wider and waited.<br><br>Well-timed comedian, waiting to see if the audience got it.<br><br>Implying she&#x2019;d come with a weapon.<br><br>Her finger continued to circle the swell and my heart skipped and my gut churned and the shock must&#x2019;ve shown on my face.<br><br>Connie Sykes laughed. Then she got up and left the office and continued up the hall.<br><br>I always walk patients to the front door. I let this patient find her own way out and locked my office door and pressed my ear to oak until I heard the front door close.<br><br>I remained inside the office for a while. A shot of Chivas didn&#x2019;t help much but the passage of time and a shot of rationalization did and eventually I convinced myself she&#x2019;d just been letting off steam. Given all the court work I&#x2019;d done, the big surprise was that it hadn&#x2019;t happened before.<br><br>A week and a half passed and when I didn&#x2019;t hear from her or spot her skulking around my property or receive any anonymous hate mail or field any weird phone messages, I told myself I needed to forget the whole thing.<br><br>What I didn&#x2019;t forget was the battle that had brought Connie Sykes to me in the first place. And while I hoped that she&#x2019;d file me away as a distant, sour memory, I suspected her loss and grief wouldn&#x2019;t fade for a long time.<br><br>If ever.<br><br>CHAPTER 2<br><br>When the divorce process begins, some people shoot out of the gate like corrida bulls, itching to inflict damage. Others declare good intentions and delay the attack. A small percentage manage to maintain civility, but the default is guerrilla warfare.<br><br>Combatants who have children often end up obsessing on the kids. That includes people who don&#x2019;t much care about being parents but lie and say that they do. Admitting apathy about your offspring&#x2014;going public with those fantasies you&#x2019;ve had for years of divorcing the whole idea of family life&#x2014;breaks a lot of social rules.<br><br>Parents who couldn&#x2019;t care less about the kids often fight the hardest because it&#x2019;s all about winning.<br><br>In the worst of divorces, children become hand grenades. Allegations of neglect, cruelty, and abuse surface, usually false. But when kids are involved everything needs to be checked out. Those are the cases when the courts call someone like me in to offer wisdom.<br><br>There&#x2019;s another side to my professional life: working with Lieutenant Milo Sturgis on hideous murders.<br><br>That&#x2019;s the easy stuff.<br><br>Back when I left Western Pediatric Medical Center and began private practice, I avoided child custody cases, going so far as to refer away patients remotely likely to become embroiled in legal conflicts. I knew that court work was lucrative but I always had plenty of work, and colleagues who&#x2019;d struggled to work within the system described it as an unpredictable mess cobbled together by a loose confederation of morons and sadists.<br><br>Best interests of the child, indeed.<br><br>My practice rolled along nicely: mostly good people bringing in mostly good kids with problems that could be handled short-term. The kind of patient load that can make you feel like a hero and who doesn&#x2019;t like that?<br><br>Then a child I was already treating became a custody case. Four-year-old Amy was being raised by a single mother who&#x2019;d done a fine job, overall, but had come to me for pointers on discipline and development and school placement. The quiet little girl owed her existence to a one-night stand between Mom and a father she&#x2019;d never met: a then-married, former Washington State trooper fired for taking bribes and suspected of worse.<br><br>Said dad had never been in Amy&#x2019;s life nor had he paid a penny of child support. Amy&#x2019;s mom had filed for payments but had never pushed; she was making do and the status quo seemed fine.<br><br>One evening her doorbell rang and there he was, trying to grope her and kiss her, leering smugly when she backed away as he served her with papers for a joint custody suit. Recently divorced, he&#x2019;d been denied contact with his other two children, had been spottily employed since being booted from law enforcement, decided it was time to &#x201c;get involved with the kid. She kind of looks like me, anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>You&#x2019;d think there&#x2019;d be no chance of his muscling into Amy&#x2019;s life. You wouldn&#x2019;t be counting on the morons and the sadists.<br><br>&#x201c;Dad&#x201d; had hired a lawyer with an aggressive streak and that legal eagle had brought in a psychologist whose wordy report strongly recommended fifty-fifty joint physical and legal &#x201c;sharing,&#x201d; which would entail Amy flying between L.A. and Spokane on a weekly basis. All in &#x201c;the obvious best psychosocial interests of this child.&#x201d;<br><br>The author of that bit of brilliance, a woman named Joan Mort, hadn&#x2019;t met Amy or her mother, relying, instead, upon &#x201c;well-documented research data on the deleterious effects of paternal absence, particularly for prepubescent girls.&#x201d;<br><br>Amy&#x2019;s mother was already scrimping to pay for therapy so I took the court case gratis and wrote my own report. The judge, one of those jurists who actually reads what lands on his desk, called for a meeting in chambers with both attorneys and both experts.<br><br>I encountered Dr. Joan Mort as she walked up the court corridor. An older woman with a slight walleye and all the right paper credentials, she had a bouncy step and one of those soft, pseudo-sweet therapy voices that cloys quickly. She gripped my hand with both of hers, said it was a pleasure to meet me, had appreciated my input. As if we were both on the same team.<br><br>Once inside, she volunteered to go first. Speaking slowly and clearly, in a well-practiced academic tone that drew heavily on jargon, she managed to couch the absurdity of her argument with apparent scholarship. Made delivering a four-year-old to the mercies of a felonious stranger sound almost reasonable.<br><br>Flipping the final page of her report, she patted my hand and smiled reassuringly.<br><br>Your turn, sonny boy.<br><br>I began with a point-by-point refutation of her little oration, keeping my voice even as I slid into a side lecture on quacks and whores-for-hire willing to say anything for a fee. Using temperate language, of course. (&#x201c;Superficial so-called evaluations that fail to pay attention to the patient nudge up against scientific and ethical boundaries, at best. At worst they cross those boundaries in a highly destructive manner. I find that inexcusable in any case but particularly destructive and cruel when a child&#x2019;s well-being is at stake.&#x201d;)<br><br>Mort and the lawyer who was paying her blanched. So did Amy&#x2019;s mom&#x2019;s attorney.<br><br>But the judge was working hard at not grinning. Thanking everyone, he adjourned the meeting. Joan Mort marched ahead of everyone and I thought she&#x2019;d lost some bounce in her step.<br><br>The following morning the judge called and asked if we could meet.<br><br>&#x201c;May I ask why, Your Honor?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to talk to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;About Amy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s resolved. In a manner that won&#x2019;t make you unhappy. I&#x2019;d like to discuss some general issues. If you need to be paid for your time, the court&#x2019;s got a little discretionary fund.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No need,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but you can buy lunch.&#x201d;<br><br>We met at a steak house near the downtown court building, a place Milo frequents when he&#x2019;s testifying or meeting with deputy D.A.&#x2019;s. His waistline-busting approach to nutrition features enough red meat to feed a bunkhouse full of ranch hands and I&#x2019;ve never seen him leave with a doggie bag. The judge, a trim man in his sixties, nibbled a six-ounce rib eye and sipped a martini and told me he liked my style and would appreciate my joining the panel of custody evaluators employed by the court.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;Is Joan Mort on the panel?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then forget it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a list, Dr. Delaware. No list is perfect.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Granted, but that&#x2019;s a club I&#x2019;m not interested in joining.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;High standards.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I try.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t hem and haw like most shrinks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;ve been told.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you won&#x2019;t consider it? You really should, precisely because of people like Mort. There&#x2019;s work to be done refining the system.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure there is but I&#x2019;m happy with my practice and I really don&#x2019;t want to dive into the . . .&#x201d;<br><br>The word I&#x2019;d been thinking of was &#x201c;muck&#x201d; but while I groped for a more appetite-friendly synonym, he said, &#x201c;Cesspool? Hell, yeah, it can stink to high heaven. But here&#x2019;s the thing: In a few weeks I&#x2019;m going to be appointed presiding judge and I&#x2019;m thinking I can clean things up. Why not help me, Doctor?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;By targeting the bad ones? I&#x2019;m not a henchman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no, I&#x2019;m not asking you to break some code of silence. Just do good work consistently and help raise our standards. Right now the only cases I&#x2019;m able to ensure get done right are my own. Once I&#x2019;m presiding I&#x2019;ll theoretically have more control, but in truth, I won&#x2019;t once the other judges get their assignments. Because each of us is a despot in his or her courtroom. One of my esteemed colleagues would have to rape a goat in the hall to get bounced.&#x201d;<br><br>The image made me smile. &#x201c;The corridors of justice takes on a new meaning.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ha.&#x201d;<br><br>I said, &#x201c;Why bother with one new psychologist?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s a start. There are other decent evaluators, even some on the panel. But I&#x2019;ve never seen anything quite like your level of . . . assertiveness. We can use some serious cojones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Flattered, Your Honor, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Steve&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Legal work&#x2019;s just not my thing, Steve.&#x201d;<br><br>Shrugging, he sliced steak into little trapezoids, ate and drank.

His memoir <i>On the Move</i> was published shortly before his death in August 2015.<b>Water Babies</b><br>We were all water babies, my three brothers and I. Our father, who was a swimming champ (he won the fifteen-mile race off the Isle of Wight three years in succession) and loved swimming more than anything else, introduced each of us to the water when we were scarcely a week old. Swimming is instinctive at this age, so, for better or worse, we never &#x201c;learned&#x201d; to swim. <br><br> I was reminded of this when I visited the Caroline Islands, in Micronesia, where I saw even toddlers diving fearlessly into the lagoons and swimming, typically, with a sort of dog paddle. Everyone there swims, nobody is &#x201c;unable&#x201d; to swim, and the islanders&#x2019; swimming skills are superb. Magellan and other navigators reaching Micronesia in the sixteenth century were astounded at such skills and, seeing the islanders swim and dive, bounding from wave to wave, could not help comparing them to dolphins. The children, in particular, were so at home in the water that they appeared, in the words of one explorer, &#x201c;more like fish than human beings.&#x201d; (It was from the Pacific Islanders that, early in the twentieth century, we Westerners learned the crawl, the beautiful, powerful ocean stroke that they had perfected&#x2014;so much better, so much more fitted to the human form than the froglike breaststroke chiefly used until that time.)<br><br> For myself, I have no memory of being taught to swim; I learned my strokes, I think, by swimming with my father&#x2014;though the slow, measured, mile-eating stroke he had (he was a powerful man who weighed nearly eighteen stone) was not entirely suited to a little boy. But I could see how my old man, huge and cumbersome on land, became transformed&#x2014;graceful, like a porpoise&#x2014;in the water; and I, self-conscious, nervous, and also rather clumsy, found the same delicious transformation in myself, found a new being, a new mode of being, in the water. I have a vivid memory of a summer holiday at the seaside in England the month after my fifth birthday, when I ran into my parents&#x2019; room and tugged at the great whalelike bulk of my father. &#x201c;Come on, Dad!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s come for a swim.&#x201d; He turned over slowly and opened one eye. &#x201c;What do you mean, waking an old man of forty-three like this at six in the morning?&#x201d; Now that my father is dead, and I am almost twice the age he was then, this memory of so long ago tugs at me, makes me equally want to laugh and cry. <br><br> Adolescence was a bad time. I developed a strange skin disease: &#x201c;erythema annulare centrifugum,&#x201d; said one expert; &#x201c;erythema gyratum perstans,&#x201d; said another&#x2014;fine, rolling, orotund words, but neither of the experts could do anything, and I was covered in weeping sores. Looking, or at least feeling, like a leper, I dared not strip at a beach or pool, and could only occasionally, if I was lucky, find a remote lake or tarn. <br><br> At Oxford, my skin suddenly cleared, and the sense of relief was so intense that I wanted to swim nude, to feel the water streaming over every part of me without hindrance. Sometimes I would go swimming at Parson&#x2019;s Pleasure, a bend of the Cherwell, a preserve since the 1680s or earlier for nude bathing, and peopled, one felt, by the ghosts of Swinburne and Clough. On summer afternoons, I would take a punt on the Cherwell, find a secluded place to moor it, and then swim lazily for the rest of the day. Sometimes at night I would go for long runs on the towpath by the Isis, past Iffley Lock, far beyond the confines of the city. And then I would dive in and swim in the river, till it and I seemed to flow together, become one.<br><br> Swimming became a dominant passion at Oxford, and after this there was no going back. When I came to New York, in the mid-1960s, I started to swim at Orchard Beach in the Bronx, and would sometimes make the circuit of City Island&#x2014;a swim that took me several hours. This, indeed, is how I found the house I lived in for twenty years: I had stopped about halfway around to look at a charming gazebo by the water&#x2019;s edge, got out and strolled up the street, saw a little red house for sale, was shown round it (still dripping) by the puzzled owners, walked along to the real estate agent and convinced her of my interest (she was not used to customers in swim trunks), reentered the water on the other side of the island, and swam back to Orchard Beach, having acquired a house in midswim. <br><br> I tended to swim outside&#x2014;I was hardier then&#x2014;from April through November, but would swim at the local Y in the winter. In 1976&#x2013;77, I was named Top Distance Swimmer at the Mount Vernon Y, in Westchester: I swam five hundred lengths&#x2014;six miles&#x2014;in the contest and would have continued, but the judges said, &#x201c;Enough! Please go home.&#x201d; One might think that five hundred lengths would be monotonous, boring, but I have never found swimming monotonous or boring. Swimming gave me a sort of joy, a sense of well-being so extreme that it became at times a sort of ecstasy. There was a total engagement in the act of swimming, in each stroke, and at the same time the mind could float free, become spellbound, in a state like a trance. I never knew anything so powerfully, so healthily euphoriant&#x2014;and I was addicted to it, am still addicted, fretful when I cannot swim. <br><br> Duns Scotus, in the thirteenth century, spoke of &#x201c;condelectari sibi,&#x201d; the will finding delight in its own exercise; and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, in our own time, speaks about &#x201c;flow.&#x201d; There is an essential rightness about swimming, as about all such flowing and, so to speak, musical activities. And then there is the wonder of buoyancy, of being suspended in this thick, transparent medium that supports and embraces us. One can move in water, play with it, in a way that has no analogue in the air. One can explore its dynamics, its flow, this way and that; one can move one&#x2019;s hands like propellers or direct them like little rudders; one can become a little hydroplane or submarine, investigating the physics of flow with one&#x2019;s own body. <br><br> And, beyond this, there is all the symbolism of swimming&#x2014;its imaginative resonances, its mythic potentials. <br><br> My father called swimming &#x201c;the elixir of life,&#x201d; and certainly it seemed to be so for him: he swam daily, slowing down only slightly with time, until the grand age of ninety-four. I hope I can follow him, and swim till I die.</p><h2>Neither Fear Nor Hope</h2><p>General von Senger sheds new light on the history of World War II.

This we learn from one of Ricky Jay's fascinating essays in a delightful small volume that takes us from the earliest forms (<i>astragali</i>the heel bones of hoofed quadrupeds, four of whose six sides were used for gaming) to the myriad types of "loading" and other means of cheating with dice in the modern era. Along the way we discover that Augustus, Caligula, and Nero were all inveterate players, that Queen Elizabeth issued a search and seizure order against the manufacture of false dice in 1598, and that dice made from celluloid, invented in 1869, remained stable for decades, and thenin a flashbegan to decompose. These are the dice of Rosamond Purcell's luminous and seductive photographs, images which transform entropy to an art form. Jay and Purcell give us a dual meditation on dice that will educate us and amuse us at the same time. 13 color photographs.</p><p><b>Ricky Jay</b> is perhaps best known as a sleight-of-hand performer whose one-man display of talent set a record as the fastest selling show in off-Broadway history. He is also an actor, a scholar, and the author of highly popular books including the best-selling <i>Learned Pigs &amp; Fireproof Women</i> and, most recently, <i>Jay's Journal of Anomalies</i>. <b>Rosamond Wolff Purcell</b>'s beautiful photographs of the strange and unusual have appeared in countless publications and have been collected in museums throughout the world. Among her many books are <i>Special Cases: Natural Anomalies and Historical Monsters, Finders Keepers: Eight Collectors</i>, and <i>Crossing Over: Where Art and Science Meet</i>, the latter two with Stephen Jay Gould.Ricky Jay knows his dice. A sleight-of-hand-performer who is appearing on Broadway in On the Stem, a one-man show directed by David Mamet (in whose movies Jay has appeared frequently), Jay here presents a light, digressive history of dice, from "astragali" (or "heel bones," as mentioned in an Indian epic poem) to how they are loaded for cheating. Dipping into everything from Viking allegory to the 1820 writings of the Rev. Charles Caleb Colton (an eventual ruined gambler and suicide), Jay's anecdotes are colorful but meandering: a description of a 1501 Florentine gambler named Antonio Rinaldeschi eases into a recollection of the outcry at the Brooklyn Museum over Chris Ofili's dung-festooned Holy Virgin Mary. Chapters such as "Dice and Death" and "The Palengenesis of Craps" are complemented by Rosamond Wolff Purcell's 13 color photographs of beautifully decayed dice (when dice age, they can be chipped and crusted, appearing to be made of salt or ice). These portraits of chance's end reveal visually what Jay tells us verbally: dice are as inherently complex and frail as people. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Crystal Connection: A Guidebook for Personal and Planetary Ascension</h2><p>Analyzes the structure of crystals and describes techniques for using them in holistic healing, stress management, and telepathic communication</p><p></p><h2>The Art of Slip-Stitch Knitting: Techniques, Stitches, Projects</h2><p>A Fresh Look at a Classic Technique<br><br>Slip stitch is one of the simplest and most versatile knitting techniques, but it's often overlooked. <i>The Art of Slip-Stitch Knitting</i> is a modern and thorough take on this technique that delivers beautiful colorwork and gorgeous textures--with minimal effort.<br><br>A complete overview covers all the basics of slip-stitch knitting, including stitch formation, reading charts, customizing stitch patterns, choosing yarns, designing with slip-stitch patterns, and more.

And he did write golden words. Before his death in 1964 he produced fourteen best-selling Bond books, two works of non-fiction and the famous children&#39;s story &#34;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang. &#34;Fleming&#39;s output was matched by an equally energetic flow of letters. He wrote constantly, to his wife, publisher, editors, fans, friends and critics--and to the wife of the man whose name Fleming appropriated for his hero--charting 007&#39;s progress with correspondence that ranged from badgering Jonathan Cape about his quota of free copies--a coin was tossed and Fleming lost--to apologizing for having mistaken a certain brand of perfume and for equipping Bond with the wrong kind of gun. His letters also reflect his friendship with such contemporaries as Raymond Chandler, Noel Coward and Somerset Maugham. This entertaining and engaging compilation traces the arc of Fleming&#39;s literary career and details the inner working of James Bond. Set against the backdrop of his Jamaican retreat Goldeneye, and a troubled marriage, Fleming&#39;s letters are filled with wit, humor and occasional self-doubt. They reveal an intimate portrait of a man, an era and a literary phenomenon.</p><p><p> Ian Fleming writes with a kind of pushing, bloodcurdling elegance.

Whether the family gathered around a classic, rosy-pink roast beef with gravy, an old-fashioned tamale pie steamed in a Dutch oven, or a creative noodle casserole called Preacher's Delight with ground beef, tomatoes, and cream cheese, nothing could beat the flavor or comfort that came from a homemade meal. In an effort to preserve these old-fashioned meals, <i>Cook's Country</i> magazine asked its readers to submit their favorite dinnertime recipes and the stories behind them.

And there are numerous dishes that speak to our country's heritage, recipes with a story worth remembering, from regional favorites like Pennsylvania Dutch Slippery Chicken Bott Bie (a pot pie stew with handmade noodles) and the Midwestern favorite Cheese Frenchees (a deep-fried, crunchy-coated grilled cheese) to old-world classics brought through Ellis Island, like a creamy, rich beef goulash and classic Italian lasagna with handmade spinach noodles. <i>Cook's Country Best Lost Suppers</i> is a collection so appealing that it's sure to encourage families to once again enjoy dinnertime together. <br> <br> <p> <b>Recipe Excerpts from <i>Cook's Country Best Lost Suppers</i></b> </p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <br> Sicilian Meatloaf </td> <td> <br> Papa's Lasagna </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <br> <br></p><h2>Dethroning Jesus: Exposing Popular Culture&#39;s Quest to Unseat the Biblical Christ</h2><p><p><em>New York Times</em> best-selling author Darrell Bock teams with Daniel Wallace to help lay readers separate fact from fiction and help from hype in the recent best-selling Jesus books and television specials.</p><p>There is a quest going on. It's the quest to reduce Jesus to a mythic legend or to nothing more than a mere man. Scholars such as Elaine Pagels and James Tabor are using such recent discoveries as the Gospel of Judas and the Gospel of Thomas to argue that the Christ of Christianity is a contrived figure and that a different Christ-one human and not divine-is the "true" Christ. </p><p>In his trademark easy-to-understand style Darrell Bock takes on these attempts to redefine Jesus in a convincing, winsome way that will help readers understand that the orthodox understanding of Christ and his divinity is as trustworthy and sure as it ever was. Joining Bock for the first time is fellow scholar Daniel Wallace. <br></p></p><p>Darrell L. Bock, PhD, Research Professor of New Testament Studies at Dallas Theological Seminary, serves as Professor for Spiritual Development and Culture for the seminary&#39;s center for Christian Leadership. A corresponding editor for Christianity Today, Dr. Bock is also past president of the Evangelical Theological Society. He and his wife, Sally, have three children and one grandson. Books Sold to Date: 275,000+ Daniel B. Wallace, Ph.D., is the author of the textbook on intermediate Greek grammar that is used in more than two-thirds of the nation&#39;s schools that teach that subject. He is the senior New Testament editor of the NET Bible.Ph.D.s and writers Bock (<i>Jesus According to Scripture</i>) and Wallace (author of one of the most widely used textbooks on New Testament Greek grammar) team up to address what they refer to as Jesusanity&#x2014;the trend to dethrone Jesus and view him as a wise and revered leader rather than as the Christ of Christianity. They examine the ideas of numerous scholars and theorists, including Bart Ehrman, Elaine Pagels, Marcus Borg and James Tabor. With precision and care drawn from their years of research, they study six key claims&#x2014;including the idea that the original New Testament manuscripts were corrupted beyond recovery, that Jesus' message was primarily political, that new gospels like Thomas and Judas throw traditional views of Jesus into doubt and that Jesus' tomb has been discovered. What emerges is an appreciation for the rigors of biblical study and a wealth of support for traditional views of Jesus. The writing is at times unclear and difficult, and could not compete on its own with the books Bock and Wallace critique. However, this overview provides a concise and well-researched evangelical Christian response to numerous popular theories, and conservative readers will be especially likely to welcome it. <i>(Nov. 6)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But when Inspector Pitt finds a list containing the names of some of London's most distinguished gentlemen in the murdered man's office, he recognizes the smell of blackmail. Fortunately, Pitt's clever, well-born wife, Charlotte has entree into London's best society. And at glittering balls and over gossipy teas, she observes a world of passion, power, and greed, that is closed to police inspection...</p><p><b>Anne Perry</b>&nbsp;is the bestselling author of two acclaimed series set in Victorian England: the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels, including&nbsp;<i>Death on Blackheath</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Midnight at Marble Arch,&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;</i>the William Monk novels, including&nbsp;<i>Blood on the Water&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Blind Justice</i>. She is also the author of a series of five World War I novels, as well as twelve holiday novels, most recently&nbsp;<i>A New York Christmas,</i>&nbsp;and a historical novel,&nbsp;<i>The Sheen on the Silk,</i>&nbsp;set in the Ottoman Empire. Anne Perry lives in Los Angeles and Scotland.Another of the author's leisurely evocations of Victorian London (Highgate Rise, 1991) by way of Police Inspector Thomas Pitt, whose latest case is the murder of moneylender-blackmailer William Weems. Pitt is surprised when asked by superior Micah Drummond to handle the case (it's out of Pitt's district), and to interview Drummond's friend Lord Byam, who was being blackmailed by Weems but denies any part in the killing. The blackmail involved the death, 20 years before, of Laura Anstiss, wife of Byam's longtime friend Lord Anstiss, a political and financial power. Pitt investigates other victims of Weems's cupidity, some of them in judiciary and police ranks of importance, and begins to uncover the sinister influence of a secret society. He's assisted by well-born, down-to-earth wife Charlotte, whose entr&#x201a;e into London's highest society--through wealthy sister Emily--helps assess some of the possibilities. Pitt's dogged sleuthing produces a dramatic, surprising finale to an overlong story--its impact watered down by masses of repetitive, finicky detail and a plethora of subplots. Fans will love it, but even they might appreciate a little less padding. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Yet despite numerous articles, books, television shows, and feature films, nobody has ever told the in-depth <i>true</i> story of this legendarily fierce-and far-reaching-clash in the heart of Appalachia. Drawing upon years of original research, including the discovery of previously lost and ignored documents and interviews with relatives of both families, bestselling author Dean King finally gives us the full, unvarnished tale, one vastly more enthralling than the myth.<br><br>Unlike previous accounts, King's begins in the mid-nineteenth century, when the Hatfields and McCoys lived side-by-side in relative harmony. Theirs was a hardscrabble life of farming and hunting, timbering and moonshining-and raising large and boisterous families-in the rugged hollows and hills of Virginia and Kentucky. Cut off from much of the outside world, these descendants of Scots-Irish and English pioneers spoke a language many Americans would find hard to understand. Yet contrary to popular belief, the Hatfields and McCoys were established and influential landowners who had intermarried and worked together for decades.<br><br>When the Civil War came, and the outside world crashed into their lives, family members were forced to choose sides. After the war, the lines that had been drawn remained-and the violence not only lived on but became personal. By the time the fury finally subsided, a dozen family members would be in the grave. The hostilities grew to be a national spectacle, and the cycle of killing, kidnapping, stalking by bounty hunters, and skirmishing between governors spawned a legal battle that went all the way to the United States Supreme Court and still influences us today.<br><br>Filled with bitter quarrels, reckless affairs, treacherous betrayals, relentless mercenaries, and courageous detectives, THE FEUD<em> </em>is the riveting story of two frontier families struggling for survival within the narrow confines of an unforgiving land. It is a formative American tale, and in it, we see the reflection of our own family bonds and the lengths to which we might go in order to defend our honor, our loyalties, and our livelihood.</p><p>Dean King is the author of the national bestseller <em>Skeletons on the Zahara</em>.

She presented her unique style, a diverse combination of cutting and sewing applications, creating new techniques altogether. Her concise step by step directions are easy to grasp, allowing the possibility for anyone to be successful at making a quilt. Eleanor Burns gave quiltmakers techniques that compacted months into merely a day, a quilt in a day, spreading her vibrant enthusiasm within everyone. She has motivated thousands of want-to-be quilters with needed confidence and assurance. Altogether, the impact of her influences opened the door to a renewal. Her efforts sowed the seeds that have grown into many techniques that are commonly used today. Since 1978 when she self-published her first book Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern, she has authored over seventy five additional books. Throughout the world today, there are thousands of inst!ructors teaching her quiltmaking methods. Her first Quilt in a Day TV series began airing on PBS in 1990 and is still broadcast nationwide and abroad and now her shows can be seen on the world wide web on QNN and Quilters TV.</p><h2>Almost Interesting: The Memoir</h2><p><p>A hilarious and biting memoir from the actor, comedian and&nbsp;<em>Saturday Night Live</em>&nbsp;alumni David Spade.</p><p>David Spade is best known for his harsh &#x201c;Hollywood&#x201d; Minute Sketches on&nbsp;<em>SNL</em>, his starring roles in movies like&nbsp;<em>Joe Dirt</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Tommy Boy</em>, &nbsp;and his seven-year stint as Dennis Finch on the series&nbsp;<em>Just Shoot Me.</em>&nbsp;Now, with a wit as dry as the weather in his home state of Arizona, the &#x201c;comic brat extraordinaire&#x201d; tells his story in&nbsp;<em>Almost Interesting.</em></p><p>First Taking fans back to his childhood as a wannabe cool younger brother and recounting his excruciating road-tour to fame&#x2014;when he was regularly mistaken for a ten year-old, Spade then dishes about his time crisscrossing the country as a comedian, for low-paying gigs and dragging along his mother&#x2019;s old suitcase full of props.

Trips</b><p>The truth about fishing trips is that they're often more about where you go and how you get there than about what you catch: not really about the fishing at all, in other words, although without it you wouldn't have gone in the first place. You naturally plan your trip for when you think the fishing will be at its best and try to make the most painless travel arrangements -- aiming at what you hope will be a satisfying narrative arc that begins and ends in your own driveway -- but the earmark of every fishing trip is still uncertainty. If it weren't, why even go?</p><p>However you travel, there are questions that go unasked because they're unanswerable but that hover there in the middle distance nonetheless. If you're driving, will your pickup break down? If not, will it make it up the last pitch on that four-wheel-drive road? If you're flying, will your flight leave on time -- or at all? Will your checked gear arrive at the same place you do, and if not, will someone have a spare rod you can borrow?</p><p>The airlines say they'll deliver your luggage to you if it comes in late, but they're picturing a hotel near the airport. I still remember my relief when a guy from Air Canada finally delivered my fly rods to me in the lobby of a hotel in Halifax at two in the morning. By the end of the next day I'd have been two more flights and a boat ride away and the drama might have ended differently.</p><p>And then there's the fishing itself. Even if it's a familiar fish in a recognizable setting, there are bound to be regional quirks. On the Namekagon River in Wisconsin, the smallmouth bass were exactly where I expected themto be and they'd eat the same commercially tied deer-hair bugs I always try first, but there they were noticeably partial to the yellow-belly version instead of the otherwise identical white-bellied ones I brought from home. Fishing is full of those minute details that actually matter.</p><p>If you're after a new species of fish, you're pretty much in the dark and you only have a short time to turn on the light. A lot of being able to catch a particular kind of fish in a particular way boils down to instinct bred of familiarity, but even if you have the instinct, you're still in unfamiliar territory. (That's why it can take a second or even a third trip to really crack a fishery.) You're an adult with your head on straight and you know the drill, but some of this stuff isn't easy and you've seen people emotionally broken by a bad skunk.</p><p>And there are bound to be potential hazards that are especially dangerous because they're outside your normal day-to-day experience. They could be as big and obvious as grizzly bears, as small and neatly camouflaged as rattlesnakes, or as obscure as a regional strain of cow parsnip with sap that burns your hands when they get wet.</p><p>Or maybe it's bush flying. Small planes are more homey and comfortable than big ones (they're sort of like pickup trucks with wings), but they have worse safety records, and it's not comforting to learn that the majority of all aviation accidents are caused by simply running out of gas. A bush pilot in Alaska once said, "The only time you can have too much fuel on an airplane is when it's on fire."</p><p>Some trips are punctuated by little shocks of realization that are profoundly exotic. A friend was once fishing somewhere in Mexico, wading ankle-deep where he was safe from sharks and stingrays, when he saw a track in the mud and asked his guide what it was. The guide said, "Jaguar, se�or." Things like that heighten your consciousness to the point that you're more acutely awareof your surroundings than usual. That's why your memories of a fishing trip are invariably more vivid than your memories of the same number of days at work.</p><p>Of course most of us are perfectly safe on even the most adventurous fishing trips, and statistically most accidents happen at home or while driving within twenty-five miles of your front door. It's not that your house and neighborhood are so dangerous, but they're so familiar you become complacent to the extent that you won't notice the dog's tennis ball left on the stairs or a new stop sign on the corner. Whatever else happens on a fishing trip, you pay attention.</p><p>I prefer driving to flying for reasons that will be obvious if you've been on a commercial airliner in the last few years. (Jim Harrison once said that commercial flying wouldn't be much worse if they towed you behind the plane in a gunnysack full of fish guts.) Driving gives you a feeling of self-reliance and allows time and distance to pass at a more human pace. If you're going a long way, it takes a long time -- as it should -- and you get to see the landscape, vegetation, wildlife and maybe even the climate gradually change. That's a romantic idea and I don't apologize for it, but there's also the practical effect that you're not jet-lagged and time-warped for your first few days of fishing.</p><p>Long drives can also make you appreciate the little things. In parts of eastern Wyoming the sight of a single tree can lift your heart, and on a rainy trip it's possible to find the almost infinite settings on your intermittent windshield wipers deeply fascinating. You're probably still on some kind of schedule when you drive, but unlike with an airline, if your partner is an hour late getting started, no one's gonna give your seats away to strangers.</p><p>If you have a moderately roomy four-wheel-drive vehicle (I drive a medium-sized, six-cylinder pickup), you can go where you have to and bring what you need -- within reason on both counts. Everyone knows that having four-wheel drive doesn't mean you can't get stuck, it just means you can get stuck in more desperate situations or even wreck your car. Once, on the worst four-wheel-drive road I'll knowingly go on, I found a brand-new Jeep Wagoneer -- complete with a temporary tag in the back window -- abandoned with a broken axle. Years later, just past an especially gnarly spot on that same road, I followed the narrow, greasy trail from a cracked oil pan but never found the vehicle. This old logging track is my absolute benchmark for difficulty. There's a worse one nearby known as Oh-My-God Road, but I've never been on it.</p><p>As for cargo room, you can get a lot of stuff in the six-foot bed of a pickup, but remember that you'll have to paw through everything you brought once you get there and that whatever you're looking for will be on the bottom of the pile. Packing lightly is symbolic of paring away the clutter of your life at least for the duration of the trip, if not permanently, and when it's done right, it can make you feel young and nimble. For years after I left home, I didn't (that is <i>couldn't</i>) own more than would fit in whatever vehicle I was driving at the time. That lean core still exists, like a fossil obscured by more recent deposits, but I can only unearth it now when I'm packing for a fishing trip.</p><p>For that matter, if there are too many comforts you can't do without, even for a week, maybe you should just stay home, although of course definitions of <i>necessity</i> and <i>luxury</i> are entirely personal. I know people who'd never think of going anywhere without a cell phone, even though they often don't work in the rural West or far North. I don't own one myself, and when someone asks "How can I reach you?" I thoroughly enjoy saying "You can't; I'll be fishing." I'm still waiting for Americans to realize that being in constant communication is not an advantage, but a short leash. Cell phones have changed us from a nation of self-reliant pioneer types into a bunch of men standing alone in supermarkets saying "Okay, I'm in the tampon aisle, but I don't see it."</p><p>The new satellite phones are obscenely expensive, but they supposedly work anywhere. That can be handy in a dire emergency, but owning one also means there's now no place left on earth aboveground where you can hide.</p><p>I do swallow my pride and fly now and then for the same reason everyone else does: to save time. I'd actually love to drive someplace like the Northwest Territories for big grayling, but I balk at the prospect of weeks on the road for a week of fishing. So I just book a flight. My one rule for trips is: Always try to spend more time fishing than you do traveling. Still, I'm always uncomfortable flying on big airlines out of big-city airports. There are dozens of little tricks that make air travel go more smoothly, but I don't know any of them, so I invariably end up in the longest, slowest line, and when I hear one of those announcements asking you to report suspicious activity, I immediately begin to wonder if I'm acting suspiciously.</p><p>On the other hand, I have done enough flying over the years to get my packing down to a science. It's really pretty simple: you bring everything you'll need and nothing you <i>won't</i> need, while at the same time staying under the baggage weight limit. I usually check a single twenty-eight-inch canvas duffle (always with trepidation) and walk on the plane carrying a small backpack and a short rod tube that passes as my "personal item," which is normally defined as a briefcase or laptop. In a pinch, I can get all three pieces down to a total of forty pounds, which is the lowest allowable weight limit I've ever encountered on a float plane.</p><p>A friend of mine keeps detailed, permanent lists of what he packs for various kinds of trips, constantly going back to cross out things he brought but didn't use and add items that might have come in handy if he'd had them. Some of these lists have been fine-tuned for decades and, needless to say, the guy is the most efficient traveler I know. I admire that kind of thinking, but apparently I'm incapable of it. Instead, I depend on a series of mental snapshots from previous trips. I don't quite have the knack my friend has, but I do okay.</p><p>The only real glitch in my packing program came a few seasons ago when I'd seen so many people breezing through airports with wheeled bags while I lugged mine on a shoulder strap that I finally began to experience duffle envy. So I bought a wheeled duffle: a great big one that would take a three-piece,...</p></p><h2>By Pond and River: Illustrated</h2><p>By Pond and River by Arabella Buckley, first published in 1907. Through life stories of frogs, dragon-flies, fish, water-bugs, water birds, otters, and voles, children&#39;s interest in water creatures is awakened. An exhibit of water plants at a flower show concludes the volume. Seven color illustrations and numerous black and white drawings complement the text. The book is intended to interest children in country life. They are written in the simplest language, so as to be fit for each class to read aloud. But the information given in them requires explanation and illustration by the teacher. I have, in fact, tried to make each lesson the groundwork for oral teaching, in the course of which the children should be en- couraged to observe, to bring in specimens, and to ask questions. Then when the chapter is read and re-read, as is the case with most school books, it will become part of the child&#39;s own knowledge.</p><p></p><h2>The Transfer Agreement: The Dramatic Story of the Pact Between the Third Reich and Jewish Palestine</h2><p>First published to international acclaim in 1984, The Transfer Agreement stunned readers worldwide with its revelations of a pact between Zionist leaders and Hitler&#39;s Third Reich. Concluded in 1933, this controversial pact transferred 55,000 Jews and $100 million to Palestine on the condition that Zionist organizations call a halt to their economic boycott of Nazi Germany -- a potent tactic that was threatening to topple Hitler&#39;s government, then only in its first year in power. The debate over this controversial deal virtually tore apart the Jewish world in the pre-World War II era, and it remains unresolved today. Whereas the transfer agreement indeed ultimately saved lives, rescued assets, and helped lay the foundation for what would become the Jewish state in 1948, it also -- arguably -- allowed the Nazi regime to survive its first year and, over the next twelve, to plumb the depths of ethnic intolerance and implement massive genocide. With the world today confronting such morally complex issues as the compensation for slave labor during the Holocaust and the refusal of Swiss banks to return Jewish assets to their rightful heirs, the transfer agreement and the boycott that preceded it stand out even more startlingly as early examples of Jewish initiatives against Nazi terror. However ambiguous the choices made by the Jewish leaders in the turbulent prewar 1930s, they stand in a new and different light today. The Transfer Agreement is a remarkable and revelatory book that has now found its time.</p><p>Edwin Black is the award-winning, New York Times and international investigative author of 80 bestselling editions in 14 languages in 61 countries, as well as scores of newspaper and magazine articles in the leading publications of the United States, Europe and Israel.

In his sober moments Jack aspires to become Ireland&#x2019;s best private investigator, not to mention its first&#x2014;Irish history, full of betrayal and espionage, discourages any profession so closely related to informing. But in truth Jack is teetering on the brink of his life&#x2019;s sharpest edges, his memories of the past cutting deep into his soul and his prospects for the future nonexistent.<br><br>Nonexistent, that is, until a dazzling woman walks into the bar with a strange request and a rumor about Jack&#x2019;s talent for finding things. Odds are he won&#x2019;t be able to climb off his barstool long enough to get involved with his radiant new client, but when he surprises himself by getting hired, Jack has little idea of what he&#x2019;s getting into.<br><br>Stark, violent, sharp, and funny, <i>The Guards</i> is an exceptional novel, one that leaves you stunned and breathless, flipping back to the beginning in a mad dash to find Jack Taylor and enter his world all over again. It&#x2019;s an unforgettable story that&#x2019;s gritty, absorbing, and saturated with the rough-edged rhythms of the Galway streets. Praised by authors and critics around the globe, <i>The Guards</i> heralds the arrival of an essential new novelist in contemporary crime fiction.&nbsp;<i>The Guards</i> is a 2004 Edgar Award Nominee for Best Novel.</p><p>There's something about the job that leads (fictional) cops and PIs to drink, which is why booze always seems to be a minor character in the genre. This is certainly the case in Ken Bruen's debut thriller about melancholy Irishman Jack Taylor, whose luck at finding things keeps him in beer money after he's kicked out of Ireland's Garda Siochna. When the mother of a young suicide victim asks him to investigate her daughter's death, Taylor discovers that Sarah Henderson isn't the only teenager to take a long walk off a short Galway pier. His search for the perpetrator gets his best friend killed, destroys his nascent relationship with his client, and sets him up for a final betrayal few readers will see coming. This promising writer doesn't need all the tricky punctuation and excess quotations from other writers to punch up his sharp, lyrical prose, but these are minor quibbles--he's a newcomer to watch. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Advance Praise for Ken Bruen and <i>The Guards</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Guards</i> blew me away. It&#x2019;s dark, funny, and moving&#x2014;just for starters. With a sharp eye and a lyrical voice, Ken Bruen takes us on a powerful odyssey through the mean streets of Galway, straight into the Irish heart. Bruen&#x2019;s tale is a potent draft of desire and hopelessness, conviction and surrender, inadvertent heroism and unexpected grace. This is mystery writing of a high order.&#x201d;&#x2014;T. Jefferson Parker, author of <i>Black Water </i>and <i>Silent Joe</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Guards</i> is a wonderful book, wrenching and real, fast, funny and wise in every sense. Why the hell haven&#x2019;t I heard of Ken Bruen before? He&#x2019;s a terrific writer and The Guards is one of the most mesmerizing works of crime fiction I&#x2019;ve ever read.

Hall, author of <i>Blackwater Sound</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Guards</i> is raw, hard, bitter, and amazing. It&#x2019;s got that ancient feel to it, as of a primal story being retold with a fine, careless Irish swagger. It&#x2019;s as if Bruen made up his mind to tell us this story whether we wanted to hear it or not. Oh, we do. For sure.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jon A. Jackson, author of <i>Badger Games</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Guards</i> is an astounding novel, a poetic account of a desperation as deep and cold as the North Sea, retribution, and resurrection. It&#x2019;s so good I can&#x2019;t think of it as a crime novel.

Escaping the ills of the British climate, the Durrell family - acne-ridden Margo, gun-toting Leslie, bookworm Lawrence and budding naturalist Gerry, along with their long-suffering mother and Roger the dog - take off for the island of Corfu. But the Durrells find that, reluctantly, they must share their various villas with a menagerie of local fauna - among them scorpions, geckos, toads, bats and butterflies. Recounted with immense humour and charm My Family and Other Animals is a wonderful account of a rare, magical childhood. &#39;Durrell has an uncanny knack of discovering human as well as animal eccentricities&#39; Sunday Telegraph &#39;A bewitching book&#39; Sunday Times</p><p>As a self-described "champion of small uglies," English writer Gerald Durrell (1925-1995) devoted his life to writing and the preservation of wildlife, from the Mauritius pink pigeon to the Rodriques fruit bat. <i>My Family and Other Animals</i> was intended to embrace the natural history of the Greek island of Corfu, but ended up as a delightful account of his family's experiences that were, according to him, "rather like living in one of the more flamboyant and slapstick comic operas." <p> As a 10-year-old boy, Gerry left England for Corfu with "all those items that I thought necessary to relieve the tedium of a long journey: four books on natural history, a butterfly net, a dog, and a jam-jar full of caterpillars all in imminent danger of turning into chrysalids." Durrell's descriptions of his family and its many eccentric hangers-on (he stresses that "all the anecdotes about the island and the islanders are absolutely true") are highly entertaining, as is the procession of toads, scorpions, geckos, ladybugs, glowworms, octopuses, the puppies Widdle and Puke, and the Magenpies. This is a lovely book.</p>Gerald Durrell was born in Jamshedpur, India, in 1925. He returned to England in 1928 before settling on the island of Corfu with his family. In 1945 he joined the staff of Whipsnade Park as a student keeper, and in 1947 he led his first animal-collecting expedition to the Cameroons. He later undertook numerous further expeditions, visiting Paraguay, Argentina, Sierra Leone, Mexico, Mauritius, Assam and Madagascar. His first television programme, Two in the Bush� which documented his travels to New Zealand, Australia and Malaya was made in 1962; he went on to make seventy programmes about his trips around the world. In 1959 he founded the Jersey Zoological Park, and in 1964 he founded the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust. He was awarded the OBE in 1982. Encouraged to write about his life&#39;s work by his brother, Durrell published his first book, The Overloaded Ark, in 1953. It soon became a bestseller and he went on to write thirty-six other titles, including My Family and Other Animals, The Bafut Beagles, Encounters with Animals, The Drunken Forest, A Zoo in My Luggage, The Whispering Land, Menagerie Manor, The Amateur Naturalist and The Aye-Aye and I. Gerald Durrell died in 1995.</p><h2>Liberty&#39;s Torch: The Great Adventure to Build the Statue of Liberty</h2><p>The Statue of Liberty is one of the most recognizable monuments in the world, a powerful symbol of freedom and the American dream. For decades, the myth has persisted that the statue was a grand gift from France, but now <i>Liberty's Torch</i> reveals how she was in fact the pet project of one quixotic and visionary French sculptor, Fr�d�ric Auguste Bartholdi. Bartholdi not only forged this 151-foot-tall colossus in a workshop in Paris and transported her across the ocean, but battled to raise money for the statue and make her a reality.<br><br>A young sculptor inspired by a trip to Egypt where he saw the pyramids and Sphinx, he traveled to America, carrying with him the idea of a colossal statue of a woman. There he enlisted the help of notable people of the age - including Ulysses S. Grant, Joseph Pulitzer, Victor Hugo, Gustave Eiffel, and Thomas Edison - to help his scheme. He also came up with inventive ideas to raise money, including exhibiting the torch at the Phildaelphia world's fair and charging people to climb up inside. While the French and American governments dithered, Bartholdi made the statue a reality by his own entrepreneurship, vision, and determination.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, July 2014:</strong> The real story of Lady Liberty doesn't come close to what Americans have been taught. The Statue of Liberty wasn&#x2019;t designed as a symbol of freedom; it began life as a sculpture of an Egyptian slave. It wasn&#x2019;t a "gift" from the French; it was an orphan in need of a home. Elizabeth Mitchell's myth-busting Liberty&#x2019;s Torch is a hoot of a story packed with entertaining cameos by Victor Hugo, Ulysses Grant, Thomas Edison, and more. At center stage is the maddeningly egotistical artiste Fr�d�ric Auguste Bartholdi, a snobbish boor who disliked America and her "subpar" people. Yet, through persistence and will, he found a home for his statue in New York Harbor and wooed newspaper magnate Joseph Pulitzer into raising money for the pedestal on Bedlow's Island, a former military fort. (One of Pulitzer's fund-raising contests yielded the poem by Emma Lazarus that&#x2019;s inscribed on the statue's base: "Give me your tired, your poor...") After nearly twenty years of construction, with the artist using his mother as the model for the statue's face, Liberty--by far the tallest statue in the world, at over 300 feet--was unveiled to near unanimous adoration on October 28, 1886. Relying on Bartholdi's diaries and letters, Mitchell reveals the unlikely truth behind a sculptor&#x2019;s obsession becoming a nation's icon. <em>--Neal Thompson</em></p><b>Elizabeth Mitchell</b> is an editor, journalist, and author.

She uses the life of Joseph Stilwell, the military attache to China in 1935-39 and commander of United States forces and allied chief of staff to Chiang Kai-shek in 1942-44, to explore the history of China from the revolution of 1911 to the turmoil of World War II, when China&#39;s Nationalist government faced attack from Japanese invaders and Communist insurgents.

Although her official title as personal secretary was relatively humble, her power and influence were unparalleled. Everyone in the White House knew one truth: If you wanted access to Franklin, you had to get through Missy.

From modest Irish Catholic Boston roots, Missy rose to become an indispensable intimate confidante, adviser, chief of staff and exclusive conduit to the most consequential personality of the Twentieth Century. No woman has ever wielded more influence in a presidential administration. Likewise, Missy was admired and respected by Eleanor, the Roosevelt children, and every other key member of the Roosevelt administration. Because of a severely disabling stroke at just forty-five years of age, Missy&#x2019;s contribution to history has been marginalized and nearly forgotten. This definitive biography, published with the authority of her family and containing much information never before revealed, is long overdue,and will finally afford Missy the credit she deserves as one of the most important female figures in American History.&#x201d; Author: Dr. Steve Lomazow, assistant professor of neurology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, author of FDR's Deadly Secret (Public Affairs, 2011), and Trustee at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Library.<br><br>"Behind every great president is a small group of advisors selflessly devoting themselves to the task of making their president as successful as possible.

And it&#39;s up to her to prove his innocence--before the blue moon creates even bigger problems for Richard...</p><p>Anita Blake makes a living raising the dead. She also executes rogue vampires and villains among the local were-folk. Marks bind her to Jean-Claude, the Master vampire of St. Louis and her lover, and to her ex-fianc�, a powerful werewolf who heads up the local pack. Anita shares some of their magic, and her own power over the dead keeps growing. But so does the body count and the situations that force Anita to bend or break her own rules.<p> In <i>Blue Moon</i>, Anita's ex Richard is jailed in Tennessee, accused of rape. When Anita arrives with a lawyer and an entourage of vampires and 'weres' supplied by Jean-Claude, it's clear that something is rotten in Myerton. The local cops are corrupt, and the trolls Richard was studying are threatened. But if she sticks around to investigate, the local Master vampire will attack her and her friends. The local werewolf clan isn't rushing to welcome her either, and her self-control is going to the, um, wolves. </p><p><i>Blue Moon</i> is the eighth book in Hamilton's <i>Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter</i> series; newcomers should start with earlier books. The protagonists' development and their relationships to each other and to the large cast of continuing secondary characters are what make these books so compelling. Be warned--there's steamy sex and graphic violence here, though Anita <i>does</i> reflect on her moral position. But if dark urban fantasy featuring those who hunt the night appeals, pounce on this series. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>Laurell K. Hamilton is a full-time writer and mother.

There was a kind of gleeful magic to the shows, a cumulative joy that transcended the crude animation and occasionally muddy sound, and it's this quality that was the essence of the legendary Jay Ward and Bill Scott. <br><br>Jay Ward was the magnificent visionary, the outrageous showman who lobbied Washington for statehood for Moosylvania, and invited the press to a picnic on the floor of the Plaza Hotel's august Grand Ballroom. Bill Scott was the genial, brilliant head writer, coproducer, and all-purpose creative whirlwind, often described as the "soul" of the shows. In fact, Scott even provided the voices for most of the star characters, giving life to Bullwinkle J. Moose, Mr. Peabody, Dudley Do-Right, and George of the Jungle. From their tiny, oddball animation studio, Jay Ward Productions, they created some of the most memorable animation of all time, and gave birth to a family of characters whose undying popularity has cast them forever into the pop culture firmament. With their distinctively unorthodox, artist-friendly philosophy, Ward and Scott attracted some of the most talented writers and voice actors in the industry, and for a time, Jay Ward Productions was a kind of Camelot of cartoons. Now, through exclusive interviews with Bill Scott, Tiffany Ward, June Foray, and dozens of others intimately involved with the Ward epoch, as well as access to original scripts, artwork, story notes, letters, and memos, Keith Scott has created the definitive history of Jay Ward Productions, including episode guides and voice credits for all the Jay Ward cartoons. <br><br>From the first "Hey Rocky, watch me pull a rabbit out of a hat!" to the last "Watch out for that tree!" this is not only the record of a legendary chapter in animation history, but also the story of a rare and magical relationship between two artists who were wildly, exuberantly ahead of their time, and the fascinating story of the struggle to bring their vision of bad puns and talking animals to unforgettable life.<br><br></p><p>Although <i>Rocky and His Friends</i> remains the cleverest and best-loved cartoon series of the baby boom era, information about the creation of the program is notoriously hard to come by. Jay Ward declined to give interviews in his later years, key artists have died, and virtually nothing survives from the hastily organized studio in Mexico City where much of the animation was done. Despite these handicaps, Australian actor Keith Scott, the voice of Bullwinkle in the 2000 film, has assembled an impressively complete studio history.<p> Unlike other television cartoon producers, Ward and his partner, writer and voice actor Bill Scott, insisted on making shows they thought were funny. The witty scripts, read by a cast of superb voice artists, remain as entertaining today as they were when <i>Rocky</i> debuted in 1959. And, as Scott documents, what occurred off-camera was often just as zany. The Coney Island Film Festival, a lavish publicity stunt to promote "Fractured Flickers," Ward's send-up of silent films, turned into a spectacular disaster when a rainstorm drenched the park--and the guests. The book has some weaknesses: there are only a few black-and-white illustrations, and Scott fails to address the impact of the cartoons--Matt Groening has frequently cited them as an influence on <i>The Simpsons</i>. The often repetitious text would have benefited from judicious editing. These caveats aside, <i>The Moose That Roared</i> will delight the legions of vociferous fans whose love for Rocky, Bullwinkle, Boris, Natasha, Dudley Do-Right, George of the Jungle, Super Chicken, Fred, and the rest of the Jay Ward characters continues, 40 years after <i>Rocky</i> began its initial run. Also available: the original cartoons on VHS, the large-format episode guide <i>The Rocky and Bullwinkle Book</i>, and <i>Fractured Fairy Tales</i>, updated by an <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> writer. <i>--Charles Solomon</i></p><br>Keith Scott is a veteran voice artist and animation historian who, beginning in his late teens, became friends with his childhood idols Jay Ward and Bill Scott. He has worked extensively in animation and radio as an expert voice mimic. He recently narrated Disney's live action movie based on the Jay Ward creation George of the Jungle, and is now starring as the voice of Bullwinkle J.

Frances Hamerstrom published over 100 scientific papers and wrote <br>several books, including two for children. Twice she won the Wildlife Society Award.</p><h2>Surrendered Wife</h2><p>At 30, Laura Doyle, like millions of women, was miserable in her marriage, but she couldn&#39;t put her finger on the cause. &#39;I was lonely and I was exhausted from trying to do everything myself. When I learned to stop controlling and criticising my husband and practised receiving graciously, something magical happened. The union I had always dreamed of appeared. The man who had wooed me was back,&#39; writes Doyle. In THE SURRENDERED WIFE, Laura Doyle presents a radical and controversial approach to relationships: women can enjoy great sex, harmony and the intimacy they crave when they stop controlling their partner. Surrendering, she says, is the simplest principle for a great marriage and thousands of women swear by it. Covering both the emotional and practical aspects of marriage, it teaches women valuable lessons including how to respect the man they married, how to resist the temptation to bicker and how to trust their man. But most importantly, it shows how you can fall in love with your man all over again. With marriages and relationships fast becoming the first casualty of modern life, THE SURRENDERED WIFE could be the key to &#39;happy ever after&#39;.</p><p>Self-proclaimed "feminist and former shrew" Laura Doyle sets forth a whopper of a game plan for establishing profound intimacy in one's marriage. Building on the gender stereotypes defined by bestselling author John Gray (<i>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus</i>), Doyle seeks to heal the overworked, underappreciated wife who snarls at her mate's every thought or action. Her message to these smart, self-sufficient types: check the nitpicking, the unsolicited opinions, and--egads!--the finances at the marital door (although she says it's still okay to wield control at work). Many women will find such advice archaic and offensive; some will simply laugh off this credential-free anachronism when they receive the book as a bridal-shower gag gift. Still others, identifying with Doyle's profile of a controlling wife, will be curious enough to dabble in her proposed art of "surrendering."<p> According to Doyle, the wife who chooses to surrender must learn to take care of herself first, overcome the desire to have more power, and abandon the myth of equality. Delving into the personal tales and sisterly advice shared within each chapter's pages, surrendering wives will further note the need to master unsavory phrases like "I can't," and "Whatever you think"--tough to swallow for a generation of women who value their own opinions. While she fully acknowledges that a few bills will go unpaid and a few deadlines or freeway exits will occasionally be missed, she also insists that surrendered wives will encounter less worry and fear, more money, and better sex. Hey, "Whatever you think...." <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p>Relinquishing Control is Wife's Key to Intimacy <p>While this book will certainly cause more of a stir than the average relationship book, particularly among feminists, it may also prove more significant. Doyle's philosophy is noticeably out of step with the prevailing thinking of our time, but she seems to have her finger on the pulse of a new trend. </p><p>"Surrendering to your husband is about being intimate with him in a way that's both gratifying and terrifying" Doyle writes. "A surrendered wife is vulnerable where she used to be a nag, trusting where she used to be controlling, grateful where she used to be dissatisfied and has faith where she once had doubt." </p><p>Doyle should know. Much of the book is written from her personal experience of morphing from a controlling, self-described shrew into a respectful wife who decided to take her husband's name for their ninth anniversary. </p><p>Written with a healthy dose of humor, The Surrendered Wife describes a movement that started with women meeting in Doyle's living room to support each other in embracing a philosophy that sounds outlandish. Still, the real-life anecdotes from the relationships of the women who pioneered this movement are inspiring. More importantly, they illustrate Doyle's point that wives who practice the fine art of receiving graciously are happier than those who "do it all." </p><p>Like ancient wisdom passed quietly around the homefires from one wise woman to the next, Doyle shares the radical, powerful philosophy of The Surrendered Wife in a way that is both compelling and comforting. This extraordinary guide is full of practical exercises designed to help women relinquish inappropriate control of their husbands and find the courage to be vulnerable: a vital ingredient for an intimate marriage. </p><p>This book epitomizes an ironic twist in the evolution of feminism--a movement that ad-dressed what women wanted in the workplace, but said little about what to expect from their husbands. The Surrendered Wife encourages every controlling wife to make her own paradigm shift and take a spiritual path to find the union she always dreamed was possible.</p></p><h2>Where The Wild Things Are</h2><p>When Max puts on hiswolf suit and makes mischief, his mother calls him &#39;Wild Thing&#39; and sends him to bedwithout any supper. But Max is not scared. Instead,Max tames the wild things and is made their king. When things have gone far enough, Max sends the wild things off to bed without theirsupper and returns to the safety of his bedroom. Alone in his room, Max enters amagical world and sets sail across the sea to the placewhere the wild things are. The wild things roar theirterrible roars and gnash their terrible teeth and roll theirterrible eyes and show their terrible claws ...</p><p><i>Where the Wild Things Are</i> is one of those truly rare books that can be enjoyed equally by a child and a grown-up. If you disagree, then it's been too long since you've attended a wild rumpus. Max dons his wolf suit in pursuit of some mischief and gets sent to bed without supper. Fortuitously, a forest grows in his room, allowing his wild rampage to continue unimpaired. Sendak's color illustrations (perhaps his finest) are beautiful, and each turn of the page brings the discovery of a new wonder. <p> The wild things--with their mismatched parts and giant eyes--manage somehow to be scary-looking without ever really being scary; at times they're downright hilarious. Sendak's defiantly run-on sentences--one of his trademarks--lend the perfect touch of stream of consciousness to the tale, which floats between the land of dreams and a child's imagination. </p> <p> This Sendak classic is more fun than you've ever had in a wolf suit, and it manages to reaffirm the notion that there's no place like home.</p><p>Fiftieth Anniversary Edition</p> <p><em>Where the Wild Things Are</em></p> <p>Winner of the 1964 Caldecott Medal for the Most Distinguished Picture Book of the Year</p> <p>The original pictures have never before been as faithfully reproduced as they are in this new edition.

No sooner has he settled in than he realizes his new neighbors are creating even more havoc than the Great Leader did. A family of outlaws, armed to the teeth, the Ameses have local law enforcement too intimidated to take them on. Then Sunderson&#x2019;s cleaning lady, a comely young Ames woman, is murdered, and black sheep brother Lemuel Ames seeks Sunderson&#x2019;s advice on a crime novel he&#x2019;s writing which may not be fiction. Sunderson must struggle with the evil within himself and the far greater, more expansive evil of his neighbor.<br><br>In a story shot through with wit, bedlam, and Sunderson&#x2019;s attempts to enumerate and master the seven deadly sins, <i>The Big Seven</i> is a superb reminder of why Jim Harrison is one of America&#x2019;s most irrepressible writers.<br></p><p><b>Jim Harrison</b> is the author of over thirty-five books of poetry, nonfiction, and fiction, including <i>Legends of the Fall, The Road Home, The English Major</i>, and <i>The Farmer's Daughter</i>.

You can't help but like feckless, unpretentiously intellectual Sunderson, inclined to tie himself in metaphysical knots when not fishing or otherwise engaging with the natural world whose splendors, movingly described, succor him in a way nothing else can . . .

So wrote John Jay, one of the revolutionary authors of <i>The Federalist Papers,</i> arguing that if the United States was truly to be a single nation, its leaders would have to agree on universally binding rules of governance--in short, a constitution. In a brilliant set of essays, Jay and his colleagues Alexander Hamilton and James Madison explored in minute detail the implications of establishing a kind of rule that would engage as many citizens as possible and that would include a system of checks and balances. Their arguments proved successful in the end, and <i>The Federalist Papers</i> stand as key documents in the founding of the United States.<b>James Madison</b> is frequently referred to as "the father of the Constitution" because of the important role that he played in the drafting of the US Constitution during the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia during the summer of 1787. He also played a key role in drafting the Bill of Rights in the First Federal Congress in 1789. He later served as secretary of state under Thomas Jefferson, and succeeded Jefferson as president, serving two terms in that office and overseeing the United States victory over Great Britain in the War of 1812. He was the last Founding Father to die, in 1836, in Montpelier, Virginia. <br> <br> <b>Alexander Hamilton</b> was born in the British West Indian island of Nevis sometime between 1755 and 1757. During the American War of Independence, he was captain of a New York artillery company and soon thereafter was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, serving as George Washington's secretary and aide-de-camp. He was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 from New York, Following that Convention, he organized the writing of <b><i>The Federalist</i></b> essays, enlisting John Jay and James Madison in the effort. From 1789 to 1795 he served as America&#x2019;s first secretary of the Treasury. A growing animosity between Hamilton and his longtime New York political rival Aaron Burr culminated in a duel between the two men in 1804. Hamilton was fatally shot and died the day after their encounter <br> <br> <b>John Jay</b> was a consistent voice for reconciliation with Great Britain in the Continental Congress. While he did not sign the Declaration of Independence, he later worked to secure support for independence in his home state of New York. He was an influential member of the peace delegation that negotiated the treaty of peace with Great Britain ending the Revolutionary War. Recruited by Alexander Hamilton to write essays for <b><i>The Federalist</i></b>, his effort was hampered by illness. He later served as the first chief justice of the Supreme Court. He retired from the Supreme Court in 1795 and served as governor of New York for six years before retiring to a farm for the last twenty-seven years of his life. <br> <br> <b>Richard Beeman</b>, the John Welsh Centennial Professor of History Emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania, has previously served as the Chair of the Department of History, Associate Dean in Penn's School of Arts and Sciences, and Dean of the College of Arts of Sciences.

In late 2011, the social media site LinkedIn reported that the word most used by its members to describe themselves was &#x201c;Creative.&#x201d;&nbsp;In this newly revised and expanded edition of his now classic book, Florida has brought all of its statistics up to date (and provided a host of new ones); further refined his occupational, demographic, psychological, and economic profile of the Creative Class; incorporated a decade&#x2019;s worth of his own and his colleagues&#x2019; quantitative and qualitative research; and addressed his major critics. &nbsp;Five completely new chapters cover the global effects of the Creative Class and explore the integral features and factors that shape &#x201c;quality of place&#x201d; in our rapidly changing cities and suburbs. Florida delves into the roles played by technology, race, and poverty in perpetuating and exacerbating income inequality and the pervasive influence of class throughout every aspect of society. Throwing down the gauntlet, he proposes a dramatic new social compact for our time&#x2014;one that can turn our emerging Creative Economy into an enduringly Creative Society.&nbsp;We currently inhabit a strange period of interregnum in which the old order has collapsed and the new order is not yet born, Florida writes. The old order has failed; attempts to bail it out, to breathe new life into it or to somehow prop it back up are doomed to history&#x2019;s dustbin. The key is not to limit or reverse the gains that the Creative Class has made but to extend them across the board, to build a more open, more diverse, more inclusive Creative Society that can more fully harness its members&#x2019;&#x2014;<i>all </i>of its members&#x2019;&#x2014;capacities.</p><p>Author of the bestselling <i>The Rise of the Creative Class </i>and <i>Who's Your City?</i><b>Richard Florida </b>is a regular columnist for <i>The Atlantic</i>.

Gerina Dunwich's enthusiasm spills onto every page, with fascinating historical tidbits about the symbols, rituals, foods, and superstitions surrounding this spooky yet festive time of year. Most of her entries are brief and offer a pinch of practical magic. For example, she suggests a Rowan Tree Protection Spell to ward off Halloween bewitchment as well as a spell to "prevent drunkenness," so revelers can party all night without losing their wits. Long ago the Scots protected themselves from Halloween "vampires, wicked Witches, demons and all person possessing an evil eye" by hanging garlic around the house. The Irish went with a sweeter scent--a wreath made of dried apples and/or heather to keep away the malevolent half of the fairy population. In the final pages, Dunwich offers recipes for Samhain Cider and other traditional delights. This makes an excellent guidebook for households that want to honor the pagan roots of this ancient holiday. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Gerina Dunwich is a High Priestess of the Old Religion and has been practicing Witchcraft for more than twenty-five years.

If you have a loved one with bipolar, you know how disruptive and straining this disorder can be to your relationship. You may experience feelings of fear, loss, and anxiety as well as a constant uncertainly about your loved one&#x2019;s ever-changing moods. </p> <p>This book is designed to help you overcome the unique challenges of loving someone with bipolar disorder. With the supportive and helpful information, strategies, and real-life examples contained here, you&#x2019;ll have all the tools you need to create a loving, healthy, and close relationship. </p> <p>Find out how to:</p> <ul> <li>Identify which coping approaches work and which do not</li> <li>Recognize and transform a &#x201c;bipolar conversation&#x201d;</li> <li>Use new strategies to help manage episodic crises</li> <li>Survive the financial turbulence manic spending may cause</li> <li>Deal with problematic sexual issues Increase closeness and stability in your relationship</li> </ul></p><p>Julie Fast and John Preston have written a ground breaking book for couples who want to prevent manic depressive disorder from hijacking their relationship. Fast, a health writer diagnosed with bipolar illness and clinical psychologist Preston are ideal companions. Their innovative ideas will be welcomed by exhausted partners of "bipolar individuals"--whose illness can cause them to alternate between manic and depressed behavior. Once medication has been prescribed, the key is studying the specific ways your partner is effected. This allows couples to develop pro-active strategies for treating and stabilizing mood swings and symptoms, before they develop into full-blown crises. The techniques emphasize prevention, rather than putting out fires. These include understanding the difference between the person and the disease (know when "the bipolar disorder is talking") listing your partner's specific symptoms, identifying the triggers that lead to these symptoms and transforming the "bipolar conversation" The goal of all the tools is to pinpoint early warning signs of a manic or depressive episode and be prepared with a holistic treatment plan. Other segments of the book deal with the work (checkered resumes) and financial problems (spending sprees) created by this illness. The author's ideas are engaging, compassionate and realistic--an oasis of relief and hope. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i>New studies estimate that 5% of the world&#39;s population has some form of bipolar disorder. This is a much higher number than originally thought. Many of the people with the illness have a significant other who is also impacted by the illness. This book is the first of its kind: written to the partner of someone with bipolar disorder and designed to mend strained relationships. Through the tools offered in the book, readers learn how to control episodic crises and discover how to create a loving, healthy, and supportive relationship with a person who has bipolar disorder.</p><h2>A Contrarian&#39;s Guide to Knowing God: Spirituality for the Rest of Us</h2><p>"Contrarian thinking at its best simply asks, <i>Is this really true</i>?

His book, THE UNITY FACTOR is now in its fourth edition. <br></b><b>SPIRITUALITY FOR THE REST OF US<br></b>I &#x2019;ve noticed that much (if not most) teaching on spirituality is a lot like books I&#x2019;ve read on marriage.<br>My wife and I always thought we had a great one until we started reading books and going to the conferences designed to tell us how to have a great marriage. We viewed our relationship as characterized by oneness of spirit, soul, and mind&#x2014;a connectedness that made two truly become one. But the books and conferences informed us that we were doing it all wrong. We weren&#x2019;t eating enough meals together, the TV was on too much, our date nights were far too rare, and our prayer time as a couple was sorely lacking. The message was clear: The fact that we had a strong marriage didn&#x2019;t matter; how we got there was what mattered most. And we&#x2019;d apparently gotten there the wrong way.<br>Their <i>tools </i>for building a great marriage had somehow become the <i>measure </i>of a great marriage.<br>And on that scale, we didn&#x2019;t measure up.<br><b><br></b><br>COOKIE-CUTTER CHRISTIANS<br>When it comes to having a great relationship with God, the same thing often happens. The tools and spiritual disciplines that can help us get there frequently become an end in themselves. Books and conferences on the inner life end up presenting a cookie-cutter approach to spirituality that focuses more on the steps we take than on the actual quality of our walk with God. The emphasis of this book is that God wants a great relationship with all of us, but it can&#x2019;t be found in a one-size-fits-all approach.<br>It&#x2019;s the end result that matters, not the path we take to get there. If something produces a great walk with God for you, it&#x2019;s a great path to take. If not, it&#x2019;s probably a waste of time, even if lots of other folks highly recommend it. Fact is, what works for one can be worthless&#x2014;even harmful&#x2014; for another. The way we&#x2019;re wired really matters. Whenever we project what works for us onto everyone else, we create frustration and legalism. When we let others project their stuff onto us we too often end up with unfounded guilt or a nervous twitch. Neither of which is very helpful when it comes to producing a great relationship with God.<br><br>DOES GOD PLAY FAVORITES?<br>As a new Christian, the more I pursued what it meant to know God and experience genuine spirituality, the more I found many of the standard answers confusing. The conventional paths to pleasing God seemed heavily tilted in the direction of certain personality types. The playing field didn&#x2019;t appear to be level. I wondered if God played favorites. On the one hand, I was told that spirituality was within the reach of everyone. On the other hand, I noticed that almost all the books on spirituality and the inner life were<br>written by introverts&#x2014;smart ones at that. I got the distinct impression that God was somehow partial to reflective types with high IQs, impressive vocabularies, and lots of self-discipline. And that left a lot of us on the outside looking in.<br><br>DO GOOD READERS MAKE BETTER CHRISTIANS?<br>I also noticed that reading seemed to be rather important. I&#x2019;m obviously not down on reading, or why write a book? But I&#x2019;m not quite sure how the ability to read well became the essential tool for<br>spiritual growth. If I want to know God and experience genuine spirituality, I&#x2019;m told to read the Bible daily. If I want to grow <i>really </i>deep, I&#x2019;m told to also read the time-honored classics written by the saints of old.<br>Now, I know the Bible is important; no argument there. But if daily Bible reading and mining the depths of the ancient scholars and mystics is the key to knowing God and God-pleasing spirituality, I wonder how regular folks got there before Gutenberg invented his printing press? Even more to the point, if reading skills are so vital, how can my friend Tony, who&#x2019;s severely dyslexic, ever hope to know God?<br><br>DO BIBLE SCHOLARS MAKE BETTER CHRISTIANS?<br>I was also puzzled by our widespread emphasis on proper doctrine as central to having a good relationship with God. I want to make it clear that I personally believe theology and sound doctrine are important&#x2014;incredibly important. What I believe about God has an undeniable impact on how I live. Wrong thinking leads to wrong decisions; always has, always will. But didn&#x2019;t Jesus say something about the kingdom of heaven belonging to those who are like little children? If he really meant it, how does our insistence on sound doctrine being essential for knowing and pleasing God fit in with a child&#x2019;s theological naivet�? Anyone who has ever been around a children&#x2019;s Sunday school class knows that these kids have some pretty messed-up theology. They haven&#x2019;t got a clue about propitiation, the Trinity, or any of<br>the other important doctrines of Scripture. If asked, they&#x2019;ll say the darnedest things.<br>But as Jesus pointed out, many of them can and do have a great relationship with God&#x2014;and often, a relationship worth emulating. That&#x2019;s caused me to wonder if sound doctrine is perhaps more the <i>result </i>of knowing and pleasing God than the primary and indispensable first step before he shows up.<br><br>WHEN THE MOLD DOESN&#x2019;T FIT<br>Finally, I wondered why I kept running across so many godly people who felt so ungodly.<br>I now realize it had more to do with our faulty definitions of spirituality than anything else. In most cases, these people felt like spiritual failures not because they were far from God, but because they&#x2019;d been unable to live up to generally accepted measures of spirituality.<br>They had stalled out in Leviticus each time they tried to read through the Bible. They were kinetic types who found extended prayer not only unfulfilling, but nearly torturous. Or extroverts who&#x2019;d bought one of those fancy leather journals, but never got around to putting anything in it.<br>Mostly, they were regular folks who for whatever reason didn&#x2019;t fit the mold too well. They tried it, but sadly found it didn&#x2019;t work for them.<br><br>A CONTRARIAN&#x2019;S PERSPECTIVE<br>As we explore what it means to know God and experience Godpleasing spirituality in a way that&#x2019;s accessible for everyone, you&#x2019;ll notice that we take some admittedly contrarian paths. But rest assured, they&#x2019;re not contrarian for contrarian&#x2019;s sake. If that were the case, they would have no value. Contrarian thinking for the sake of being contrarian is an arrogant waste of time. Claiming that the world is flat just because everyone else says it&#x2019;s round is a fool&#x2019;s playground. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with conventional wisdom when it&#x2019;s right. And most of the time it is. But when it&#x2019;s not, someone has to speak up.<br>Contrarian thinking at its best simply asks, <i>Is that really true? </i>And it speaks up when the politically correct answer or conventional wisdom doesn&#x2019;t match reality&#x2014;when things don&#x2019;t work the way<br>everyone says they do or thinks they do. Contrarianism also represents a much-needed form of candor. It dares to speak the unspeakable, to voice what others may have been thinking but for some reason have been afraid to say out loud. Much like a young boy standing by the roadside asking, &#x201c;Why is the emperor butt naked?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s the kind of thinking, candor, and courage I hope you&#x2019;ll find on the pages to follow. My bet is that you&#x2019;ll find some of it incredibly freeing, some of it annoying, some maddening, and some of it still open to debate.<br><br><b>Contrarian thinking<br>at its best simply asks,<br>Is that really true?<br></b><br>I also hope you&#x2019;ll find yourself thinking more than a few times, &#x201c;You know, I always thought the same thing&#x2014;but I didn&#x2019;t know anybody else did too.&#x201d;</p><h2>�crits: A Selection</h2><p><p><strong>A major new translation of one of the most influential psychoanalytic works of modern times.</strong></p> Brilliant and innovative, Jacques Lacan's work has had a tremendous influence on contemporary discourse.

Billions had died, billions more were doomed. Moons, planets, the very stars themselves, faced destruction, cold-blooded, brutal, and worse, random. The Idirans fought for their Faith; the Culture for its moral right to exist. Principles were at stake. There could be no surrender. Within the cosmic conflict, an individual crusade. Deep within a fabled labyrinth on a barren world, a Planet of the Dead proscribed to mortals, lay a fugitive Mind. Both the Culture and the Idirans sought it. It was the fate of Horza, the Changer, and his motley crew of unpredictable mercenaries, human and machine, actually to find it, and with it their own destruction.

Clive flourished amid the confusion. He quickly distinguished himself both in battle, showing bravery and unusual presence of mind, and in trade. The combination was profitable for his employer, the East India Company, and although Clive committed suicide in the wake of political scandal in 1774, he set in motion what would become the British conquest of India and the establishment of the Raj, a mixed form of government in which the English ruled through a network of Indian politicians and civil servants. Outwardly stable, the Raj was constantly under threat both by Indian aspirations to self-rule and by other imperialists' intrigues, notably on the part of Russia, Britain's chief competitor in what would come to be called "the great game." Lawrence James, a longtime student of British military history, offers a sweeping, and wholly absorbing, narrative account of the Raj, taking it from Clive's time to the era of Mahatma Gandhi and the flamboyant Viscount Mountbatten, the last British viceroy of India. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Lawrence James studied History and English at York University and subsequently undertook a research degree at Merton College, Oxford. Following a career as a teacher, he became a full-time writer in 1985. He lives in St. Andrews, Scotland, with his wife, who is the headmistress at St,. Leonard&#39;s School, and his two sons.</p><h2>The Christmas Mouse (The Fairacre Series #10)</h2><p>WONDERING AT THE PLEASURE IT HAD GIVEN HER.

Miss Read was awarded an MBE in the 1998 New Year Honours list for her services to literature. She was the author of many immensely popular books, including two autobiographical works, but it was her novels of English rural life for which she was best known. The first of these, Village School, was published in 1955, and Miss Read continued to write about the fictional villages of Fairacre and Thrush Green for many years.

And Reynolds's friendly, pseudo-academic style seamlessly blends new information with old. (In the Sand People description, you can't help but hear Alec Guinness's voice when Reynolds reveals that "Sand People ride in single file to hide their numbers.") In a few instances, the book shines an embarrassing light on the movies (Max Rebo is clearly no alien lifeform, just a poofy, blue elephant muppet), but the countless close-ups of thermal detonators, imperial blasters, and gaffi sticks more than make up the difference. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Exciting new photography and exhaustive research reveal previously onknown features of Star Wars characters, creatures, droids, and equipment.

In her senior year she edited the college magazine, having decided at the age of sixteen to become a writer. Her first novel, Strangers on a Train, was made into a classic film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1951. The Talented Mr Ripley, published in 1955, introduced the fascinating anti-hero Tom Ripley, and was made into an Oscar-winning film in 1999 by Anthony Minghella. Graham Greene called Patricia Highsmith &#39;the poet of apprehension&#39;, saying that she &#39;created a world of her own - a world claustrophobic and irrational which we enter each time with a sense of personal danger&#39; and The Times named her no.1 in their list of the greatest ever crime writers. Patricia Highsmith died in Locarno, Switzerland, in February 1995. Her last novel, Small g: A Summer Idyll, was published posthumously, the same year.<b>Praise for Patricia Highsmith</b><br><br>"[Highsmith's] characters are irrational, and they leap to life in their very lack of reason. . . . Highsmith is the poet of apprehension rather than fear."&#x2014;Graham Greene<br><br>"For some obscure reason, one of our greatest modernist writers, Patricia Highsmith, has been thought of in her own land as a writer of thrillers. She is both. She is certainly one of the most interesting writers of this dismal century."&#x2014;Gore Vidal<br><br>"Miss Highsmith's genius is in presenting fantasy's paradox: successes are not what they seem. . . . Where in the traditional fairy tale the heroine turns the toad into a prince, in Miss Highsmith's fables the prince becomes a toad&#x2014;success is nearly always fatal. . . . Combining the best features of the suspense genre with the best of existential fiction&#x2014;a reflection&#x2014;the stories are fabulous, in all the senses of that word."&#x2014;Paul Theroux<br><br>"Patricia Highsmith's novels are peerlessly disturbing&#x2014;bad dreams that keep us restless and thrashing for the rest of the night."&#x2014;Terrence Rafferty, <i>New Yorker</i><br><br>"Highsmith, who can change reality to nightmare with one well-turned phrase, is a legendary crime writer."&#x2014;<i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i><br></p><h2>Maigret Sets a Trap (A Harvest/Hbj Book)</h2><p>Five women have been found stabbed to death in the Montmatre district of Paris and the killer is still at large; desperate, angry and exhausted, Maigret sets a trap for the killer - with terrible consequences.

Hundreds of Bible verses are organized according to 52 common types of misbehavior, along with numerous parenting ideas and suggestions. Now in its 3rd edition, For Instruction in Righteousness has been updated and expanded after 18 years of faithful service. This new edition has over 50 pages added, with many chapters expanded as a result of additional parenting experience and Bible study. This book was originally written for our own benefit, to help us fulfill the important duties Scripture requires of us as parents: We must discipline our children when they disobey God&#39;s standards We must encourage our children when they obey We must exhort our children daily, and restore them when they show repentance We must warn unruly children of the consequences of their sin We must direct our children to God&#39;s Word for guidance We must deliver appropriate consequences promptly and consistently We must provide an example of God&#39;s justice and mercy For Instruction in Righteousness is a valuable tool that will help you, in specific ways, to fulfill each of these duties God has given us. Most chapters include each of the following sections: What the Bible says will, or should, happen to a person who sins in this way, with ideas for discipline that parallel these Biblical consequences. Instructions the Bible gives for repenting of this sin (newly added in this edition!) What the Bible likens a person to when he indulges in this sin, and ideas for practical object lessons using these examples. How God blesses the person who resists temptations to this sort of sin, with parallel ideas for &#34;rewards&#34; and encouragement when children show progress in overcoming this sin. Stories and people in the Bible that illustrate obedience and disobedience in this area.

She was a respected senior professor of English who had celebrated her fiftieth birthday a month before. As she crested a hill, she caught a branch in the spokes of her bicycle, which instantly pitched her to the pavement. Her chin took the full force of the blow, and her head snapped back. In that instant, she was paralyzed.</p><p>In A Body, Undone, Crosby puts into words a broken body that seems beyond the reach of language and understanding. She writes about a body shot through with neurological pain, disoriented in time and space, incapacitated by paralysis and deadened sensation. To address this foreign body, she calls upon the readerly pleasures of narrative, critical feminist and queer thinking, and the concentrated language of lyric poetry. Working with these resources, she recalls her 1950s tomboy ways in small-town, rural Pennsylvania, and records growing into the 1970s through radical feminism and the affirmations of gay liberation.</p><p>Deeply unsentimental, Crosby communicates in unflinching prose the experience of "diving into the wreck" of her body to acknowledge grief, and loss, but also to recognize the beauty, fragility, and dependencies of all human bodies. A memoir that is a meditation on disability, metaphor, gender, sex, and love, A Body, Undone is a compelling account of living on, as Crosby rebuilds her body and fashions a life through writing, memory, and desire.</p></p><p><b>Christina Crosby </b>is a Professor of English and Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Wesleyan University. She is the author of The Ends of History: Victorians and the 'Woman Question' (1991) and has published essays and reviews in Victorian Studies, PMLA, College English, and elsewhere."Crosby weaves poetry and literary references into her her story in an attempt to find meaning in her life. Her poignant, well-written, and thoughtful memoir will be of interest to scholars in feminist, gay, and disability studies." (<i>Journal of American Culture</i>)<br><br>"In its intellectual generosity, its frankness, and its dexterous deployment of the resources of scholarship toward the ends of life writing,A Body, Undonerecalls other invaluable memoirs of illness and disability by feminist academics like Susan GubarsMemoir of a Debulked Womanand Eve Kosofsky SedgwicksA Dialogue on Love, though unlike those antecedents Crosby engages explicitly with the now-robust field of disability studies." (<i>Feministing.com</i>)<br><br>"Perhaps the most profound lesson of Crosby's book is how lonely pain is...[she] is not the person whose suffering can be made into a vessel for other people's metaphors. Her book's drama lies in trying to decode who she really is." (<i>New Republic</i>)<br><br>"[S]harp and transformativeA Body, Undoneis about a calamitous accident, yes, but its also about the accident of all our lives, and the inevitable mortality that informs every one of our days." (<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"Part grueling diary of living with chronic pain and part celebration of survival, this is a complicated understanding of what it means to change your definition of living while living through it." (<i>Elle</i>)<br><br>"[A Body, Undone]is fascinating and painful, humiliating and beautiful...There's no bitterness in these pages, no anger at the action that led to her injury." (<i>Mediander.com</i>)<br><br>"Our sense of ourselves cannot exist outside our bodies. As such, Crosby's act of writing the body is a powerful act of self-preservation." (<i>Inside Higher Ed.</i>)<br><br>"Crosby discusses her reality with a candor that must be experienced to be believed. And the reader is left to face the truth that one's embodiment and the world that goes with it) can change utterly and forever, in a heartbeat." (<i>Inside Higher Ed.</i>)<br><br>"Christina Crosby insists on the challenge of living on after great pain and loss and shows us what it is like to begin this altered life in ones middle years. Tender, fierce, and eloquent, A Body, Undone is a necessary, even life-altering book." (Laura S. Levitt,author of American Jewish Loss after the Holocaust)<br><br>"Most memoirs about life with a disability 'almost always move toward a satisfying conclusion of lessons learned, Crosby writes. But Crosby knows that there are no satisfying conclusions when one lives 'a life beyond reason'--and that bit of wisdom alone is cause to read this elegant and harrowing book."

Ballard used a specially designed remote imaging system to locate and photograph the wreck and then returned the following year to further survey and photograph the site in a three-person submarine. This pictorial record of his expedition is filled with good quality color and black-and-white pictures. Wherever possible he compares the modern-day pictures to original ones of the Titanic . After briefly discussing other attempts to find the Titanic , he gives a solid account of the sinking, then details the events that led to the ship's discovery. Highly recommended for libraries with an interest in the Titanic.

They were a humble bunch: an accountant, a life insurance salesman, a newspaper editor, an engineering student, and a diplomat. Together they formed one of the most effective assassination squads in history. They named their operation Nemesis, after the Greek goddess of retribution. The assassins were survivors, men defined by the massive tragedy that had devastated their people. With operatives on three continents, the Nemesis team killed six major Turkish leaders in Berlin, Constantinople, Tiflis, and Rome, only to disband and suddenly disappear. The story of this secret operation has never been fully told, until now. <br><br>Eric Bogosian goes beyond simply telling the story of this cadre of Armenian assassins by setting the killings in the context of Ottoman and Armenian history, as well as showing in vivid color the era's history, rife with political fighting and massacres. Casting fresh light on one of the great crimes of the twentieth century and one of history's most remarkable acts of vengeance, Bogosian draws upon years of research and newly uncovered evidence. <i>Operation Nemesis </i>is the result--both a riveting read and a profound examination of evil, revenge, and the costs of violence.</p><p><strong>Eric Bogosian</strong> is an actor, playwright, and novelist of Armenian descent. He was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his play <i>Talk Radio</i>, and is the recipient of the Berlin Film Festival's Silver Bear Award, as well as three Obie Awards and the Drama Desk. In addition to his celebrated work in the theater and onscreen, he has authored three novels. He lives in New York City with the director Jo Bonney."Absorbing reading.... To his great credit, Bogosian recognizes [the moral contradiction] and refuses to portray Tehlirian or any of the other members of his group as heroes. He's aware of the gravitas of his story and the need to set it in context....Where it matters most he delivers: in his gripping action accounts of Nemesis at work, and in the sober assessment of its terrible aftermath."&#x2015;<b><i>Joseph Kanon, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></i></b><br><br>"Hitler asked, 'Who remembers the Armenians?' Eric Bogosian, that's who. Read his potent, action-packed account of how a little known assassination plot harkens back to a world-historical genocide and so will you. So take that, Hitler."&#x2015;<b><i>Sarah Vowell, author of <i>The Wordy Shipmates</i> and <i>Assassination Vacation</i></i></b><br><br>"A dark and compelling tale of blood vengeance. In <i>Operation Nemesis</i>, Eric Bogosian tells the remarkable story of how a small group of powerless, post-war assassins sought revenge against the all-powerful masterminds of the Armenian genocide."&#x2015;<b><i>Annie Jacobsen, author of <i>Operation Paperclip</i></i></b><br><br>"Absorbing and accessible, Bogosian presents this complex and multi-layered history with a master dramatist's flair. <em>Operation Nemesis </em>is an engaged and provocative account of an unforgettable tragedy and a cathartic attempt at finding justice."&#x2015;<b><i>Atom Egoyan, Academy Award-nominated writer and director of <i>The Sweet Hereafter</i> and <i>Ararat</i></i></b><br><br>"Eric Bogosian, actor, playwright and novelist, can now add historian to his resume with this carefully researched tale of organized revenge on the perpetrators of one of the most heinous state-engineered genocides in modern history--the murderous expulsion of the Armenian people from Ataturk's newly reconstituted Turkey."&#x2015;<b><i>Richard Price, author of <i>The Whites</i></i></b><br><br>"A dramatic work of history that reads like a thriller.... Though others have covered Operation Nemesis, Bogosian's extensive reliance on the assassin's memoirs, published seven years before his death in 1960, injects his account with the psychological highs and lows Tehlirian endured. Bogosian also uncovers intriguing details about the role of the British in the assassination plot, introducing a new twist to a story that reads like a John le Carr� novel."&#x2015;<b><i>Michael Bobelian, <i>Los Angeles Times</i></i></b><br><br>"An engrossing, heavily-researched account.... The details read like a Hollywood epic, but Bogosian plays it straight, letting the facts tell the story without sensationalizing or romanticizing.... Highly readable."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly</i></i></b><br><br>"Bogosian dives passionately into an underreported piece of history, a surprisingly effective conspiracy to assassinate the planners of Turkey's Armenian genocide."&#x2015;<b><i>Boris Kachka, <i>Vulture</i></i></b><br><br>"If you think you know all the great thriller stories of the last century, you don't. And this one is true. <i>Operation Nemesis</i> reads like a high-stakes suspense novel, but it tells us something essential about the world we're living in right now."&#x2015;<b><i>Peter Blauner, author of <i>Slipping Into Darkness</i> and <i>Slow Motion Riot</i></i></b><br><br>"This genocide has finally come to light and Eric's book takes you uncomfortably close to it.

In the states, their faith flourished and the family grew, even in the hard times. All his life, Demos wondered about his destiny. Not a gifted speaker, he discovered his gift of &#34;helps&#34; and he and his wife sponsored many evangelists and meetings in southern California. Despite his commercial success in the dairy and grain business, though, he often wondered what God had planned for his life. Faithfulness and patience paid off as, step by step, the Lord led him through the founding and expansion of the Full Gospel Businessman&#39;s Fellowship International - the largest group of its kind in the world. Sharing testimonies and real life encounters with the power of God, businessmen from around the world encourage, support and reach out to people for the sake of the gospel. This is an insightful, powerful book as you walk through the years with Demos and his faith.</p><p></p><h2>Flights</h2><p><b>SHORTLISTED FOR THE MAN BOOKER INTERNATIONAL PRIZE 2018</b> <p><i>Flights</i>, a novel about travel in the twenty-first century and human anatomy, is Olga Tokarczuk's most ambitious to date. It interweaves travel narratives and reflections on travel with an in-depth exploration of the human body, broaching life, death, motion, and migration. From the seventeenth century, we have the story of the Dutch anatomist Philip Verheyen, who dissected and drew pictures of his own amputated leg. From the eighteenth century, we have the story of a North African-born slave turned Austrian courtier stuffed and put on display after his death. In the nineteenth century, we follow Chopin's heart as it makes the covert journey from Paris to Warsaw. In the present we have the trials of a wife accompanying her much older husband as he teaches a course on a cruise ship in the Greek islands, and the harrowing story of a young husband whose wife and child mysteriously vanish on a holiday on a Croatian island. With her signature grace and insight, Olga Tokarczuk guides the reader beyond the surface layer of modernity and towards the core of the very nature of humankind.</p></p><p>'Olga Tokarczuk is a household name in Poland and one of Europe's major humanist writers, working here in the continental tradition of "thinking" or essayistic novel. <i>Flights</i> has echoes of WG Sebald, Milan Kundera, Danilo Kis and Dubravka Ugresic, but Tokarczuk inhabits a rebellious, playful register very much her own...<i>Flights</i> is a passionate and enchantingly discursive plea for meaningful connectedness, for the acceptance of "fluidity, mobility, illusoriness". After all, Tokarczuk reminds us, "Barbarians don't travel. They simply go to destinations or conduct raids". Hotels on the continent would do well to have a copy of <i>Flights</i> on the bedside table. I can think of no better travel companion in these turbulent, fanatical times.' --Kapka Kassabova, <i>Guardian</i><br><br>'a profound meditation on time, mythology, the self and human anatomy...[W]e drift along happily on her flights of fancy, as her travels across space give way to journeys through history and deep into the psyche. Jennifer Croft's bump-free translation only adds to the reader's pleasure.'- Chris Moss, <i>Prospect Magazine</i> <p>'In the vein of WG Sebald [<i>Flights</i>] knits together snippets of fiction, narrative and reflection to meditate on human anatomy and the meaning of travel: this is a delicate, ingenious book that is constantly making new connections.' --Justine Jordan, <i>Guardian</i><br><br>'Tokarczuk examines questions of travel in our increasingly interconnected and fast-moving world....Trained as a psychologist, Tokarczuk in interested in what connects the human soul and body. It is a leitmotif that, despite apparent lack of a single plot, tightly weaves the text's different strands - of fiction, memoir and essay - into a whole. Some chapters are more akin to traditional travel notes: sketches of airport encounters, fellow travellers' 'confessions of whole lifetimes', and other things people often jot down when on a journey. There are also beautiful set pieces, occasionally split into recurring threads.' --Anna Aslanyan, <i>Spectator</i></p>Olga Tokarczuk is one of Poland's best and most beloved authors. In 2015 she received the Brueckepreis and the prestigious annual literary award from Poland's Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, as well as Poland's highest literary honour, the Nike, and the Nike Readers' Prize. Tokarczuk also received a Nike in 2009 for <i>Flights</i>.

There are plenty of sight gags and silly puns (a worried buffalo complains about his cell phone's roaming charges), but don't expect to get through without picking up on a literary reference or two.

It has become Gaborn's fate to follow, even into the depths.</p><p>Raj Ahten, the great warlord endowed with the strength and qualities of thousands of men, once the primary threat to Gaborn, now struggles to retain his own empire. His war of conquest thwarted, his very life is now threatened by the Reaver thousands.</p><p>And a young girl, Averan, who has eaten a Reaver and absorbed some of its memories, becomes a keystone in the search for the dark Reaver lair.</p></p><p>This is the third book in David Farland's epic fantasy Runelords series, following <i>The Runelords</i> and <i>Brotherhood of the Wolf</i>. Having sacrificed most of his Earth-based magical powers in the previous book, King Gaborn is sworn to pursue the army of unfathomable Reavers across the land of Mystarria, hoping to slay them before they can take refuge in their underground lair. A revelation from Averan, a young girl who's gained the memories of a Reaver by eating its brain, forces a change in plan, however. If the Reavers get underground, she learns, they will be rallied by the magic of the One True Master Reaver and return to fight, more deadly than ever. Averan's own budding Earth Power leads to her being chosen as apprentice by Gaborn's Earth wizard Binnesman, and her Reaver knowledge will make her an indispensable part of Gaborn's forces. In the meantime, evil forces seek to murder Gaborn's wife and prevent her from giving birth to a son who could be more powerful than his father, while Gaborn's enemy Raj Ahten--who, like Gaborn, is also losing his endowed Earth Power--pursues the Reavers through his kingdom as well. <p> In the end, the book stops just as things are finally starting to move, but while offering little plot development and no real surprises, this latest chapter in the Runelords saga is still likely to please Farland's dedicated fans. <i>--Charlene Brusso</i></p><p>The towering third book of the immensely popular Farland epic,<i> The Runelords</i></p><p>Certain works of fantasy are immediately recognizable as monuments, towering above the rest of the category.

I have to sign my name in a book and then he hands me a security dog tag on a silver chain, which I slip into the hip pocket of my suit trousers.&nbsp;"Just take a seat beyond the stairs. Someone will be down to see you in a moment."&nbsp;The wide, high-ceilinged hall beyond the reception area exudes all the splendor of imperial England. A vast paneled mirror dominates the far side of the room, flanked by oil portraits of gray-eyed, long-dead diplomats. Its soot-flecked glass reflects the bottom of a broad staircase, which drops down in right angles from an unseen upper story, splitting left and right at ground level. Arranged around a varnished table beneath the mirror are two burgundy leather sofas, one of which is more or less completely occupied by an overweight, lonely-looking man in his late twenties. Carefully, he reads and rereads the same page of the same section of The Times, crossing and uncrossing his legs as his bowels swim in caffeine and nerves. I sit down on the sofa opposite his.&nbsp;Five minutes pass.&nbsp;On the table the fat man has laid down a strip of passport photographs, little color squares of himself in a suit, probably taken in a booth at Waterloo station sometime early this morning. A copy of The Daily Telegraph lies folded and unread beside the photographs. Bland nonstories govern its front page: IRA hints at new ceasefire; rail sell-off will go ahead; 56 percent of British policemen want to keep their traditional bobbies' helmets. I catch the fat man looking at me, a quick spot-check glance between rivals. Then he looks away, shamed. His skin is drained of ultraviolet, a gray flannel face raised on nerd books and Panorama. Black oily Oxbridge hair.&nbsp;"Mr. Milius?"&nbsp;A young woman has appeared on the staircase wearing a neat red suit. She is unflustered, professional, demure. As I stand up, Fat Man eyes me with wounded suspicion, like someone on his lunch break cut in line at the bank.&nbsp;"If you'd like to come with me. Mr. Lucas will see you now."&nbsp;This is where it begins. Following three steps behind her, garbling platitudes, adrenaline surging, her smooth calves lead me up out of the hall. More oil paintings line the ornate staircase.&nbsp;Running a bit late today. Oh, that's okay. Did you find us all right? Yes.&nbsp;"Mr. Lucas is just in here."&nbsp;Prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet.&nbsp;A firm handshake. Late thirties. I had expected someone older. Christ, his eyes are blue. I've never seen a blue like that. Lucas is dense boned and tanned, absurdly handsome in an old-fashioned way. He is in the process of growing a mustache, which undercuts the residual menace in his face. There are black tufts sprouting on his upper lip, cut-rate Errol Flynn.&nbsp;He offers me a drink, an invitation seconded by the woman in red, who seems almost offended when I refuse.&nbsp;"Are you sure?" she says, as if I have broken with sacred tradition. Never accept tea or coffee at an interview. They'll see your hand shaking when you drink it.&nbsp;"Absolutely, yes."&nbsp;She withdraws and Lucas and I go into a large, sparsely furnished room nearby. He has not yet stopped looking at me, not out of laziness or rudeness but purely because he is a man entirely at ease when it comes to staring at people. He's very good at it.&nbsp;He says, "Thank you for coming today."&nbsp;And I say, "It's a pleasure. Thank you for inviting me. It's a great privilege to be here."&nbsp;There are two armchairs in the room, upholstered in the same burgundy leather as the sofas downstairs. A large bay window looks out over the tree-lined Mall, feeding weak, broken sunlight into the room. Lucas has a broad oak desk covered in neat piles of paper and a framed black-and-white photograph of a woman whom I take to be his wife.&nbsp;"Have a seat."&nbsp;I drop down low into the leather, my back to the window. There is a coffee table in front of me, an ashtray, and a closed red file. Lucas occupies the chair opposite mine. As he sits down, he reaches into the pocket of his jacket for a pen, retrieving a blue Mont Blanc. I watch him, freeing the trapped flaps of my jacket and bringing them back across my chest. The little physical tics that precede an interview.&nbsp;"Milius. It's an unusual name."&nbsp;"Yes."&nbsp;"Your father, he was from the Eastern bloc?"&nbsp;"His father. Not mine. Came over from Lithuania in 1940. My family have lived in Britain ever since."&nbsp;Lucas writes something down on a brown clipboard braced between his thighs.&nbsp;"I see. Why don't we begin by talking about your present job. The CEBDO. That's not something I've heard much about."&nbsp;All job interviews are lies. They begin with the r�sum�, a sheet of word-processed fictions. About halfway down mine, just below the name and address, Philip Lucas has read the following sentence:&nbsp;I have been employed as a Marketing Consultant at the Central European Business Development Organization (CEBDO) for the past eleven months.&nbsp;Elsewhere, lower down, are myriad falsehoods: periods of work experience on national newspapers ("Could you do some photocopying please?"); a season as a waiter at a leading Genevan hotel; eight weeks at a London law firm; the inevitable charity work.&nbsp;The truth is that CEBDO is run out of a small, cramped garage in a mews off Edgware Road. The kitchen doubles for a toilet; if somebody has a crap, no one can make a cup of tea for ten minutes. There are five of us: Nik (the boss), Henry, Russell, myself, and Anna. It's very simple. We sit on the phone all day talking to businessmen in central--and now eastern--Europe. I try to persuade them to part with large sums of money, in return for which we promise to place an advertisement for their operation in a publication known as the Central European Business Review. This, I tell my clients, is a quarterly magazine that enjoys a global circulation of four hundred thousand copies, "distributed free around the world." Working purely on commission I can make anything from two to three hundred pounds a week, sometimes more, peddling this story. Nik, I estimate, makes seven or eight times that amount. His only overheads, apart from telephone calls and electricity, are printing costs. These are paid to his brother-in-law who desktop publishes five hundred copies of the Central European Business Review four times a year. These he posts to a few selected embassies across Europe and to all the clients who have placed advertisements in the magazine. Any spares, he throws in the bin.&nbsp;On paper, it's legal.&nbsp;I look Lucas directly in the eye.&nbsp;"The CEBDO is a fledgling organization that advises new businesses in central--and now eastern--Europe about the perils and pitfalls of the free market."&nbsp;He taps his jaw with the bulbous fountain pen.&nbsp;"And it's entirely funded by private individuals? There's no grant from the EC?"&nbsp;"That's right."&nbsp;"Who runs it?"&nbsp;"Nikolas Jarolmek. A Pole. His family have lived in Britain since the war."&nbsp;"And how did you get the job?"&nbsp;"Through the Guardian. I responded to an advertisement."&nbsp;"Against how many other candidates?"&nbsp;"I couldn't say. I was told about a hundred and fifty."&nbsp;"Could you describe an average day at the office?"&nbsp;"Broadly speaking, I act in an advisory capacity, either by speaking to people on the telephone and answering any questions they may have about setting up in business in the UK or by writing letters in response to written queries. I'm also responsible for editing our quarterly magazine, the Central European Business Review. That lists a number of crucial contact organizations that might prove useful to small businesses that are just starting out. It also gives details of tax arrangements in this country, language schools, that kind of thing."&nbsp;"I see. It would be helpful if you could send me a copy."&nbsp;"Of course."&nbsp;To explain why I am here.&nbsp;The interview was set up on the recommendation of a man I barely know, a retired diplomat named Michael Hawkes. Six weeks ago I was staying at my mother's house in Somerset for the weekend, and he came to dinner. He was, she informed me, an old university friend of my father's.&nbsp;Until that night I had never met Hawkes, had never heard my mother mention his name. She said that he had spent a lot of time with her and Dad when they were first married in the 1960s. But when the Foreign Office posted him to Moscow, the three of them had lost touch. All this was before I was born.&nbsp;Hawkes retired from the Diplomatic Service earlier this year to take up a directorship at a British oil company called Abnex. I don't know how Mum tracked down his phone number, but he showed up for dinner alone, no wife, on the stroke of eight o'clock.&nbsp;There were other guests there that night, bankers and insurance brokers in bulletproof tweeds, but Hawkes was a thing apart. He had a blue silk cravat slung around his neck like a noose and a pair of velvet loafers embroidered on the toe with an elaborate coat of arms. There was nothing ostentatiously debonair about any of this, nothing vain; it just looked as if he hadn't taken them off in twenty years. He was wearing a washed-out blue shirt with fraying collar and cuffs and stained silver cuff links that looked as though they had been in his family since the Opium Wars. In short, we got on. We sat next to each other at dinner and talked for close on three hours about everything from politics to infidelity. Three days after the party my mother told me that she had spotted Hawkes in her local supermarket, stocking up on Stolichnaya and tomato juice. Almost immediately, like a task, he asked her if I had ever thought of "going in for the Foreign Office." My mother said that she didn't know.&nbsp;"Ask him to give me a ring if he's interested."&nbsp;So on the telephone that night my mother did what mothers are supposed to do.&nbsp;"You remember Michael, who came to dinner?"&nbsp;"Yes," I said, stubbing out a cigarette.&nbsp;"He likes you. Thinks you should try out for the Foreign Office."&nbsp;"He does?"&nbsp;"What an opportunity, Alec. To serve Queen and Country."&nbsp;I nearly laughed at this, but checked it out of respect for her old-fashioned convictions.&nbsp;"Mum," I said, "an ambassador is an honest man sent abroad to lie for the good of his country."&nbsp;She sounded impressed.&nbsp;"Who said that?"&nbsp;"I don't know."&nbsp;"Anyway, Michael says to give him a ring if you're interested. I've got the number. Fetch a pen."&nbsp;I tried to stop her. I didn't like the idea of her putting shape on my life, but she was insistent.&nbsp;"Not everyone gets a chance like this. You're twenty-four now. You've only got that small amount of money your father left you in his Paris account. It's time you started thinking about a career and stopped working for that crooked Pole."&nbsp;I argued with her a little more, just enough to convince myself that if I went ahead it would be of my own volition and not because of some parental arrangement. Then, two days later, I rang Hawkes.&nbsp;It was shortly after nine o'clock in the morning. He answered after one ring, the voice crisp and alert.&nbsp;"Michael. It's Alec Milius."&nbsp;"Hello."&nbsp;"About the conversation you had with my mother."&nbsp;"Yes."&nbsp;"In the supermarket."&nbsp;"You want to go ahead?"&nbsp;"If that's possible. Yes."&nbsp;His manner was strangely abrupt. No friendly chat, no excess fat.&nbsp;"I'll talk to one of my colleagues. They'll be in touch."&nbsp;"Good. Thanks."&nbsp;Three days later a letter arrived in a plain white envelope marked private and confidential.&nbsp;Foreign and Commonwealth Office&nbsp;No. 46A------Terrace&nbsp;London SW1&nbsp;PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL&nbsp;Dear Mr. Milius,&nbsp;It has been suggested to me that you might be interested to have a discussion with us about fast-stream appointments in government service in the field of foreign affairs which occasionally arise in addition to those covered by the Open Competition to the Diplomatic Service. This office has a responsibility for recruitment to such appointments.&nbsp;If you would like to take this possibility further, I should be grateful if you would please complete the enclosed form and return it to me. Provided that there is an appointment for which you appear potentially suitable, I shall then invite you to an exploratory conversation at this office. Your travel expenses will be refunded at the rate of a standard return rail fare plus tube fares.&nbsp;I should stress that your acceptance of this invitation will not commit you in any way, nor will it affect your candidature for any government appointments for which you may apply or have applied.&nbsp;As this letter is personal to you, I should be grateful if you could respect its confidentiality.&nbsp;Yours sincerely,&nbsp;Philip Lucas&nbsp;Recruitment Liaison Office&nbsp;Enclosed was a standard-issue, four-page application form: name and address, education, brief employment history, and so on. I completed it within twenty-four hours--replete with lies--and sent it back to Lucas. He replied by return post, inviting me to the meeting.&nbsp;Copyright � 2001 by Charles Cumming.

It assembles 20 years worth of paintings, sculptures, and drawings that map the evolution of one of the most influential and internationally renowned artists working today. The book and exhibition will draw connections between Nara&#x2019;s work and the sensibilities of youth subcultures worldwide, focusing on themes of alienation and rebellion, particularly in relation to rock and punk music, the inspiration and subject of many of Nara&#x2019;s works. Featuring artworks that have never before been exhibited, this is the book Nara&#x2019;s legion of devoted followers have been waiting for.&nbsp;<br><br>Praise for <i>Yoshimoto Nara</i>:<br><br>"Nara's work has an irresistible appeal well represented here." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i><p></p></p><p>Melissa Chiu and Miwako Tezuka are the director and associate curator of Asia Society Museum and cocurators of the 2010 exhibition. <p></p><br> &nbsp;<p></p><br> Midori Matsui is a noted Japanese art critic. Michael Wilson is an associate editor for <i>Artforum </i>magazine. <p></p><br> &nbsp;<p></p><br> Hideki Toyoshima founded <i>graf </i>design collective, which has collaborated with Nara on multiple installations.<p></p><p></p>In September the work of the contemporary Japanese artist Yoshitomo Nara will fill New York City's Asia Society Museum (of which Chiu is director) in an unprecedented one-man show. This catalogue also pulls out all the stops. Mimicking the windows in Nara's installations, an elaborate slipcase has cutouts with several of Nara's captivating characters peeking out. The essays, of uneven quality, place Nara in the company of animator Walt Disney, indie rock, and Margaret Keane, a painter of kitschy, wide-eyed child-people. Nara speaks best for himself in 300 illustrations and in several blog entries. He describes his love of album jacket art: "Once I spilled coffee over a jacket. It didn't affect the sound, but I ended up buying the same record again (laugh...)." These excerpts represent Nara as a truly contemporary artist engaged with social media and unafraid to pop up on mass merchandise. With its punk music influences and Morton-salt-girl-meets-David-Lynch aesthetic, Nara's work has an irresistible appeal well represented here. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Two students of Sufism, James Fadiman and Robert Frager, have collected some of the jewels of Sufic literature, polished them up a bit, and organized them for ready contemplation.

The extensive introduction provides practical context, and preambles to each section set the tone for what's to come. If you haven't encountered the wisdom of Sufi mysticism, the material in this book is a good place to start; if you have, it's a comfortable place for return."The Sufis are the mystics of Islam. Every upright Muslim expects to see God after death, but the Sufis are the impatient ones. They want God now--moment by moment, day by day, in this very life. And they are willing to undergo the disciplines that make that possible. This book presents selections from a multitude of saints and sages whose hearts were opened through the Sufi path." (Huston Smith, from the Foreword) <p>Written by Sufi prophets, saints, and teachers, these luminous stories, fables, and aphorisms help us to see the love and generosity of God in all of creation, and to experience the love for all things that embodies the Sufi's relationship with God. Voicing a passionate faith that aims to soften hearts hardened by daily life and open them to love, the Sufi tradition as illustrated in these pages teaches us to seek the Divine while remaining engaged in the world, to find our opportunities for spiritual growth, awareness, and generosity, and to realize that there is nothing in this world or the next that is not both loved and loving.</p></p><h2>Patriot Games</h2><p>CIA analyst Jack Ryan and his family are caught in a deadly game of international terrorism when an ultra-left-wing faction of the IRA targets him for stopping one of their assassination attempts.

We live in a time of remarkable discovery. The world of quantum physics is revealing that the sub-atomic, &#x201c;energetic&#x201d; level of creation relates directly to our health both physically and emotionally. Rapid and effective healing treatments of many kinds have arisen out of this discovery but they have been developed from a New Age worldview. Subsequently, these advances have been considered off limits for the Christian community. But the Splankna Therapy Institute is changing that. In this groundbreaking book Sarah J. Thiessen teaches us how to think redemptively in our current healing culture. Grounded in scripture, she walks the reader through the two main arguments against the Christian&#x2019;s use of energy healing techniques: New Age and witchcraft. She leaves the reader with new clarity and empowerment. The energetic level of creation belongs to God. It&#x2019;s time He got the credit for it.</p><p></p><h2>George H.

Whether examining Lord Acton&#x2019;s dictum that &#x201c;absolute power corrupts absolutely&#x201d; or explicating John Stuart Mill&#x2019;s contention that it is &#x201c;better to be a human dissatisfied than a pig satisfied,&#x201d; Alan Ryan evokes the lives and minds of our greatest thinkers in a way that makes reading about them a transcendent experience. Whether writing about Plato or Augustine, de Toqueville or Thomas Jefferson, Ryan brings a wisdom to his text that illuminates John Dewey&#x2019;s belief that the role of philosophy is less to see truth than to enhance experience. With this unparalleled tour de force, Ryan emerges in his own right as one of the most influential political philosophers of our time.</p><p>Alan Ryan was warden of New College, Oxford University, where he was a professor of political theory. He is the author of John Dewey and the High Tide of American Liberalism, Bertrand Russell: A Political Life, and On Politics: A History of Political Thought from Herodotus to the Present.&#x201c;With an unmatched magisterial command, Alan Ryan powerfully reminds and teaches us how the leading thinkers since classic times can and must inform our debates over how to envision the better world we must build.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Anthony W. Marx, President, New York Public Library</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Alan Ryan has created a vision of the entire surge of Western political thought which is equal to the heroic venture of George Sabine, which I studied in my youth. Ryan demonstrates throughout vivacity, and a tenacious grasp of the human meaning of everything that has transpired in political speculation from the ancients on through the threshhold of our own dark age. I commend particularly his terse eloquence, his capacious erudition, and the verve and judicious intensity with which he somehow allows his whole being to inform his vast scope and deep concern of our human limitations.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Harold Bloom</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In a work of astonishing scope and ambition, Alan Ryan, surveying the whole vast field, concisely charts the welter of conflicting positions and tracks the sometimes thrilling, sometimes catastrophic consequences of political thought.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Stephen Greenblatt, author of <i>The Swerve: How the World Became Modern</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;If you want to understand why we think as we do, go back to the ancient Greeks. Alan Ryan brilliantly explains why that is true&#x2015;and why it matters.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Mary Beard, author of <i>The Roman Triumph</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Alan Ryan has taken a vast range of challenging material written over twenty five centuries in the West and engaged with it in prose of stunning clarity. He displays the intrinsic interest of reflection on writers from Herodotus to yesterday, while showing how it can be a powerful resource for dealing with politics today. It is an amazing achievement to combine so much learning with such lucidity.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Anthony Appiah, author of <i>Cosmopolitanism</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In an age of specialization, we have lost much of the sense of the sweep of the story of Western thinking about politics. In his new book, Alan Ryan has recovered the greatness and deficiencies of that experience. ...Written with an exceptional clarity and presence of voice, Ryan&#x2019;s book is the best comprehensive statement of the achievements and failures of the Western liberal tradition.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tracy B. Strong, UCSD Distinguished Professor, Political Science Department, University of California, San Diego</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In lucid, precise and accessible prose, Alan Ryan has written an unparalleled guide for our times to the Western tradition of political thought.

In more than a thousand pages, Alan Ryan, a longtime Oxford professor who now teaches at Princeton, undertakes to introduce the reader to most of the major political thinkers in Western history...The tensions of modern liberal democratic societies are the intellectual motor of the book... Lively and intellectually engaging... <em>On Politics</em>, like the great works of philosophy it examines, constitutes a powerful brief against the unexamined life.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Adam Kirsch, <em>New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Monumental... At the heart of the project is a belief that this stuff matters, that the thinkers it revolves around&#x2015;Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, Karl Marx&#x2015;remain relevant and fresh...

The monumental stone edifice, built in a stolid, neoclassical style, loomed behind the young blond woman, silent and dark. Roberta peered at her wristwatch; it was ten past two in the morning, only ninety seconds later than the last time she'd checked her watch. <i>What's keeping Seven and that darn cat?</i> she wondered anxiously. <i>They should be back by now.</i> </p><p> Restless and apprehensive, she strolled down the sidewalk, wincing at the sound of her own heels clicking against the pavement. The echo of her footsteps rang out far too loudly for Roberta's peace of mind. The last thing she wanted to do was attract the attention of the local cops or, worse yet, one of the innumerable informants working for the Stasi, the dreaded East German secret police. </p><p> Fortunately, Unter den Linden, the wide city boulevard running north past the embassy, seemed deserted at this ridiculously late hour. The only traffic she heard was an elevated train rattling by a few streets over. Roberta clung to the shadow cast by the huge building, keeping a safe distance from the streetlamps at either end of the block, while also maintaining a careful lookout for any sign of trouble. "C'mon, c'mon," she muttered impatiently, wishing Seven could hear her. <i>You'd think I'd be used to this sort of thing by now,</i> she thought; after all, she'd been working with Gary Seven, alias Supervisor 194, for nearly six years now, ever since that unforgettable afternoon in 1968 when she'd shown up for what she'd thought was an ordinary secretarial job, only to find herself caught up in a bizarre happening involving nuclear missiles, talking computers, and a starship from the future. </p><p> <i>Heck,</i> she mused, <i>what's a little East German espionage compared to some of the spacey shenanigans Seven has dragged me into over the last few years?</i> Nevertheless, she shivered beneath a heavy gray overcoat, and not just from the cold. The thick wool garment she wore was neither flattering nor fashionable, but it helped to preserve her anonymity while simultaneously warding off at least some of the winter's chill. A black beret and matching kerchief, the latter tied below her chin, concealed most of her tinted honey-blond hair, while her gloved hands were thrust deeply into the pockets of her coat for warmth. Her fidgety fingers toyed with a thin silver device, snugly stowed away in the right pocket, that looked and felt like a common fountain pen. A mere pen, however, wouldn't have reassured Roberta nearly as much as this particular mechanism, even as she prayed devoutly that she wouldn't have need to use the servo before this night was over. </p><p> A pair of headlights approached from the north and Roberta turned her back on the empty street. <i>Probably just a delivery truck making a late-night run,</i> she guessed, stepping deeper into the gloomy shadow of the embassy, but her heart raced a little faster anyway. Roberta held her breath, while casting a wistful glance southward toward the lights of the Brandenburg Gate, only a block and a half away. The imposing marble arches, along with their attendant armed border guards and vigilant watchdogs, marked the frontier between East and West Berlin, making the safety of the Allied Sectors seem tantalizingly close by. </p><p> Granted, those brown-uniformed guards were under orders to shoot any would-be escapees on sight, but Roberta couldn't help experiencing an irrational urge to make a run for it. <i>Don't be silly,</i> she scolded herself. <i>It's not going to come to that. Seven will be back any second now...I hope.</i> </p><p> A covered truck rumbled past her, and she breathed a sigh of relief as the unassuming vehicle rounded the corner two blocks farther up the boulevard, disappearing down the adjacent cross-street. <i>That would be Friedrichstrasse,</i> she remembered, mentally calling up the maps she'd memorized for this mission. Her briefing had been exhaustively thorough, but no amount of preparation was going to help her, she realized, if she got caught on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain. </p><p> A rueful smile lifted the corners of her lips. She could just imagine trying to explain her situation to a stone-faced Stasi interrogator: <i>No, no, I'm not affiliated with the CIA or the U.S. government at all. I'm actually working for an independent operator trained by a bunch of secretive extraterrestrials who want to keep humanity from nuking itself into extinction...</i>Boy, wouldn't that go over great with the Commies! She's probably end up in a Soviet asylum, if she wasn't simply shot at dawn. </p><p> <i>"Guten abend, fraulein,"</i> a voice whispered in her ear. </p><p> Gasping out loud, Roberta spun around to find a stranger standing beside her. Where the heck had he come from? In her effort to evade detection from the passing truck, she had completely overlooked the newcomer's arrival. <i>Sloppy, sloppy,</i> she castigated herself for her carelessness. <i>Some spy girl I am. Emma Peel would never let someone sneak up on her like this.</i> </p><p> Thankfully, the speaker did not look like much of a threat, at least not on the surface. To Roberta's vast relief, the man wore neither a police nor an army uniform; instead he looked like a middle-aged accountant or shopkeeper, out for a post-midnight stroll. The man was short and jowly, his balding head exposed to the frigid night air and a pair of plain, black spectacles perched upon his bulbous, somewhat florid nose. Like Roberta's, his hands had sought the warmth of his coat pockets, but, despite the cold, his face was flushed and red. <i>Germany's the beer-drinking capital of the world,</i> Roberta recalled. Maybe the stranger was just heading home after an especially long night at his favorite bar? </p><p> "Er, hello," Roberta replied uncertainly. She spoke in English, but her automatic translator, ingeniously disguised as a silver pendant shaped like a peace symbol, converted her awkward greeting into perfect German, just as her matching earrings conveniently translated the stranger's every utterance into English. <i>Beats a Berlitz course any day,</i> she thought, grateful for Seven's advanced alien technology. </p><p> "You shouldn't be out so late, pretty girl," the man warned her ominously. The avid gleam in his eyes, as well as a sinister smile, belied the cautionary nature of his words. Peering past the stranger's spectacles, Roberta flinched at the sight of the German's glazed, bloodshot eyes. <i>I haven't seen eyes that crazy since the last time Charlie Manson was on TV,</i> she thought, stepping backward and away from her unwelcome visitor. "Don't you know it's not safe?" he taunted her. His left hand emerged from his pocket, clutching the ivory handle of something that looked alarmingly like a closed switchblade. </p><p> Just my luck! Roberta lamented silently. You try to do a little innocent night's spying and what do you get? Attacked by some sort of psycho/mugger/ rapist! "Stay back!" she whispered hoarsely, afraid even now to raise her voice so near the soldiers guarding the gate. "I'll scream, I swear it!" </p><p> She was bluffing, of course. She didn't dare raise an alarm. That could compromise the entire mission, putting Seven in danger as well, not to mention the cat. </p><p> "Go ahead," the German said, licking his fleshy lips in anticipation. With a click, a silver blade sprang from the ivory handle, catching the light of the streetlamps. "Old Jack likes screams, especially from pretty young things who know they're about to die." </p><p> Roberta fumbled in her pocket for her servo, briefly losing track of the pen-shaped weapon amid a clutter of loose change and wadded-up Kleenex. Before she could seize hold of it again, her assailant's knife slashed across the outside of her coat, slicing through the fabric and sending the contents of her pocket spilling onto the sidewalk. Roberta's eyes widened as the slender silver instrument bounced twice upon the cracked, uneven pavement, then rolled to a stop only a few inches away from the slasher's feet. </p><p> The man caught the hopeless yearning in her gaze and glanced downward. "Hah!" he laughed at the sight of Roberta's errant servo. Saliva sprayed from his mouth as he mocked her. "What were you planning to do, <i>fraulein?</i> Write Old Jack a nasty letter?" </p><p> "Hey, the pen is mightier than the sword, or the switchblade, or whatever," Roberta answered defiantly, yanking her hand free from the perforated pocket and assuming a defensive stance. "Or haven't you heard?" </p><p> Her glib response elicited an angry scowl from the knife-wielding German. His ruddy features took on a bestial appearance as he advanced on Roberta with premeditated slowness, waving his blade back and forth before her watchful eyes. The yellow radiance of a distant lamp glinted off the shining, sharpened metal. "You ought to be more afraid, harlot. You should scream, scream for your life!" </p><p> <i>Nothing doing,</i> Roberta resolved, guessing that the psycho probably got off on his victims' fear. Struggling to maintain a confident expression, she raised her hands before her, karate-style. "Watch who you're calling names, you cornball creep. Who do you think you are, Jack the Rip-Off?" <i>That was a good one,</i> she thought, the wisecrack bolstering her courage. <i>Too bad the gag's probably lost in translation...</i> </p><p> The German smirked, as though at a private joke of his own. "You have no idea who you're dealing with, you stupid trollop, but I'll slice the impertinence from your bones, bit by bloody bit!" He lunged at Roberta, stabbing at her wildly while growling like a rabid beast. A string of drool trailed down his chin while his blood-streaked eyes bugged from their sockets. "Die, harlot, die!" </p><p> If he expected Roberta to shriek or run away, he was to be severely disappointed. Six years of covert missions alongside Gary Seven, facing everything from radioactive mutants to cyborg zombies, had taught the twenty-four-year-old woman how to take care of herself. </p><p> As her assailant stabbed his knife at her belly, she pivoted to the left, dodging the thrust, while parrying the blow with her right arm. Then she used her left to block and trap Jack's own arm long enough for her to grab on to his knife hand and steer it away from her body. As the German snarled in frustration, Roberta pressed her left arm against his elbow, forcing him to the pavement with a flawless forearm takedown. Dropping her knee onto his hyperextended arm freed her left hand, allowing her to wrestle the knife from his grip. <i>Guess all those jujitsu classes finally paid off,</i> she thought triumphantly. </p><p> Jack suddenly found himself facedown upon the asphalt, unarmed and at her mercy. Her knee kept his arm pinned to the ground, while both hands held on to his captured arm. She could have broken the limb easily from this position, but settled for pulling back on it painfully. Twisting his head, the crazed German stared back over his shoulder at Roberta, blinking in confusion. Clearly, he had not anticipated that his attractive young prey would offer such stiff resistance, let alone refuse to be intimidated by his threats and vicious attacks. "How -- ?" he murmured, breathing heavily from his exertions. His spectacles dangled precipitously upon the tip of his nose. "Who -- ?" </p><p> "I am woman, hear me roar," she stated, apr�s Helen Reddy. Had that song been a hit in East Germany, too? Roberta wasn't sure, but she hoped that her twisted adversary had gotten the message. <i>That'll teach this lunatic to underestimate us liberated American chicks!</i> </p><p> A rustle from above caught their attention. Still sprawled upon the sidewalk, Jack looked upward, past Roberta. His jaw dropped at the sight of a man in a business suit rappelling down the front of the embassy. </p><p> <i>About time,</i> Roberta thought. </p><p> The bottom end of a black nylon cable struck the sidewalk only seconds before the man himself touched down on the pavement. A tall, slender individual in a conservative gray suit, he looked to be in his late thirties, with touches of gray streaking his neatly trimmed brown hair. Shrewd gray eyes coolly assessed the situation: Roberta's torn coat, the knife-wielding stranger on the ground. </p><p> "Trouble, Ms. Lincoln?" Gary Seven asked calmly, arching a nearly invisible, faint-brown eyebrow. As if his dramatic entrance were not incongruous enough, a sleek black cat was draped over his shoulders. A white collar studded with sparkling transparent gems glittered against the feline's glossy fur. </p><p> "You might say that," Roberta conceded. The cat squawked at her indignantly, as if criticizing the human female for her carelessness in attracting the likes of Old Jack. <i>And hello again to you, too,</i> Roberta thought peevishly, glaring back at her four-legged nemesis, who sprang from Seven's shoulders onto the pavement, looking grateful to be back on solid ground. <i>Mrraow,</i> the feline squawked once more. </p><p> "Quiet, Isis," Seven addressed the cat. "I'm sure this wasn't Ms. Lincoln's fault at all." </p><p> All of this was much too weird for the dumbfounded slasher; with a burst of unexpected strength, he threw Roberta off him and scrambled to his feet. Abandoning his knife, he darted away, eager to make a hasty exit. <i>No way!</i> Roberta thought angrily. <i>You're not getting away from me that easily.</i> Snatching up her servo from where it had fallen, she set the weapon on Subdue and fired at the fleeing bad guy. </p><p> Despite his frantic haste, Jack was still in range. Watching his scurrying figure slow down, then collapse onto Unter den Linden, Roberta started to take off toward the tranquilized maniac, only to feel Seven lay a restraining hand upon her shoulder. "Not now, Ms. Lincoln," he advised. "We have no time for this." </p><p> "But -- ?" she blurted. The man was a menace to women everywhere. She couldn't just let him off with a warning. </p><p> "Leave him to the local authorities," Seven instructed firmly, no doubt anticipating her outraged arguments. </p><p> As if to prove his point, a shrill whistle suddenly blared from the vicinity of the gate. <i>"Achtung!"</i> a harsh voice cried out, followed by the sound of boots pounding on asphalt. "Put your hands up and stay where you are!" </p><p> <i>Oh, no!</i> Roberta realized that her altercation with Jack had finally drawn the attention of the border guards. Lights came on in the previously darkened windows of the embassy. Voices inside shouted in Russian, even as an enormous searchlight, mounted atop a sentry tower just before the Brandenburg Gate, swung in their direction, exposing all three of them -- Roberta, Seven, and Isis -- to a blinding glare that lit up the entire block. The spotlight stretched the trio's shadows out like taffy behind them. </p><p> "This way," Seven instructed.

Reissue.</p><p>Here is the famous first case that launched the legendary career of Hercule Poirot and his ingenious creator Agatha Christie, now the most popular mystery writer of all time, as well as the world's best-selling author (over two billion copies of her books are in print). With The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Agatha Christie's cerebral and eccentric Belgian detective steps out of retirement and into the limelight of a classic mystery.<p>Styles Court is a magnificent English manor house owned by a rich, strong-willed matron who, to the dismay of her stepson, has recently married a fortune hunter. The scene is set for death by violence. The murder of the mistress of Styles Court is so baffling, so cleverly-plotted, that it challenges even the skill of Hercule Poirot, notwithstanding the legions of tiny gray cells that take residence in his ever-so-fertile mind.</p>Who poisoned the wealthy Emily Inglethorpe, and how did the murderer penetrate and escape from her locked bedroom? Sus-pects abound in the quaint village of Styles St. Mary--from the heiress's fawning new husband to her two stepsons, her volatile housekeeper, and a pretty nurse who works in a hospital dispensary. Making his unforgettable debut, the brilliant Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is on the case. <br>"The key to the success of this style of detective novel," writes Elizabeth George in her Introduction, "lies in how the author deals with both the clues and the red herrings, and it has to be said that no one bettered Agatha Christie at this game."</p><h2>Penguin Classics Fear and Trembling: Dialectical Lyric By Johannes De Silentio (Penguin Pocket Hardbacks)</h2><p>In Fear and Trembling, S�ren Kierkegaard&#39;s infamous and controversial work made a lasting impression on both modern Protestant theology and existentialist philosophers such as Sartre and Camus. This Penguin Classics edition is translated from the Danish with an introduction by Alistair Hannay. Writing under the pseudonym of &#39;Johannes de silentio&#39;, Kierkegaard expounds his personal view of religion through a discussion of the scene in Genesis in which Abraham prepares to sacrifice his son Isaac at God&#39;s command. Believing Abraham&#39;s unreserved obedience to be the essential leap of faith needed to make a full commitment to his religion, Kierkegaard himself made great sacrifices in order to dedicate his life entirely to his philosophy and to God. The conviction shown in this religious polemic - that a man can have an exceptional mission in life - informed all Kierkegaard&#39;s later writings. His &#39;teleological suspension of the ethical&#39; challenged the contemporary views of Hegel&#39;s universal moral system, and was also hugely influential for both protestant theology and the existentialist movement. Alastair Hannay&#39;s introduction evaluates Kierkegaard&#39;s philosophy and the ways in which it conflicted with more accepted contemporary views. This edition also includes detailed notes to complement this groundbreaking analysis of religion, and a new chronology. Danish-born S�ren Kierkegaard (1813-55) wrote on a wide variety of themes, including religion, psychology, and literature. He is remembered for his philosophy, which pioneered the idea of the Absurd, and was influential and in the development of 20th century existentialism. His other works include The Sickness unto Death, Either/Or, and Papers and Journals, all of which are available in Penguin Classics. If you enjoyed Fear and Trembling, you might like Kierkegaard&#39;s The Sickness unto Death, also available in Penguin Classics.</p><p>Danish-born S�ren Kierkegaard (1813-55) wrote on a wide variety of themes, including religion, psychology, and literature.

A member of the Church since 1832 and an apostle after 1835, Brigham Young served as president of the Council of Twelve Apostles after the death of Joseph Smith in 1844 and in January 1848 was sustained as president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Brigham Young served as president until his death on August 29, 1877. Acknowledged to be one of America&#39;s great colonizers, Brigham Young was also governor of Utah Territory from 1850 to 1858, superintendent of Indian Affairs from 1851 to 1858, a founder of about 350 communities in the far west, and founder of several score business enterprises. A believer in the principle of plural marriage practiced by the Mormons during his lifetime, Brigham Young was the head of one of America&#39;s largest families. Sixteen of his wives bore him fifty-seven children. Of these children, forty-six grew to maturity, including seventeen sons and twenty-nine daughters. The Church Archives has more than one hundred letters written by Brigham Young to his children, including letters written to sons while they were away on proselyting missions for the Church, others written to sons who studied in eastern universities, still others written to sons away on business trips, and letters to two sons who were in the military service. The Church Archives has the responsibility of collecting and preserving manuscript materials related to the history of the Mormon people. It also has the responsibility of making available materials in the archives that would be edifying and informative. Among the most interesting of these pertaining to Brigham Young are his letters to his sons that are presented in this volume. Enjoying a warm relationship with his sons, Brigham Young gave them fatherly counsel through these letters. This advice is as relevant today as it was when written a century ago.</p><p></p><h2>The Flower Master</h2><p>Family secrets come to haunt half-American, half-Japanese Rei Shimura, a Tokyo antiques dealer, when she attempts to reveal the murderer of her instructor in ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arranging. By the author of Zen Attitude. Reprint.</p><p>Rei Shimura, a twentysomething Japanese American antiques dealer, returns for a third outing in Sujata Massey's series set in Japan (<i>Zen Attitude</i>, <i>The Salaryman's Wife</i>). In <i>The Flower Master</i>, Rei's former boyfriend has left Japan, and her antiques business is only slightly more successful than her love life. Then she's dragooned by her aunt Norie into enrolling at a famous Tokyo ikebana school. Rei's not a natural at the ancient art of flower arranging, but she has a talent for sleuthing, which comes in handy when the head teacher at the Kayama School is found dead--with a pair of flower shears exactly like the ones Norie gave her lodged in her neck. <p> Rei's efforts to find the killer and unravel the secrets entwining her Tokyo family with the Kayamas move the action along, but the real mystery is whether the budding romance between the California girl who can't quite find her place in the tradition-bound society of modern Japan and the handsome environmental activist slated to take over as <i>iemoto</i> (headmaster) of the school will flower into lasting love. Intrigue and multiple murders spice the romance, along with a fascinating explication of ikebana's enduring history.

PSALM 126:3 Eddie Travilla&#39;s face was scrunched into a quizzical expression. &#39;I&#39;ve thunk and I&#39;ve thunk, Papa, and I just can&#39;t remember,&#39; the little boy said. Edward Travilla struggled not to laugh. &#39;You&#39;ve thought and you&#39;ve thought,&#39; he corrected gently, &#39;and still you can&#39;t remember. But it was a day very important to your life, Son.&#39; &#39;I &#39;member Missy&#39;s birthday and my birthday and Vi&#39;s birthday and the day Harold and Herbert were born.&#39; Eddie&#39;s eyes brightened. &#39;Is that it, Papa? Is it the twins&#39; birthday?&#39; he asked excitedly. &#39;No, Son, their birthday is not until next spring.&#39; Eddie&#39;s face fell again. &#39;It&#39;s not yet Christmas and not the Fourth of July,&#39; he said as his brow wrinkled in concentration. &#39;And it can&#39;t be Bruno&#39;s birthday. That&#39;s a very important day, but we wouldn&#39;t have a big party for Bruno. We wouldn&#39;t have a party for our dog, would we?&#39; &#39;No, we probably wouldn&#39;t,&#39; Edward agreed. &#39;It&#39;s understandable that you don&#39;t remember the day we are going to celebrate. It happened before you were born. Shall I tell you what it was?&#39; With a big sigh of relief, Eddie replied, &#39;Please do, Papa. I&#39;ve thunk---thought so hard I&#39;ve worn my brain out.&#39; At this Edward did laugh, and he lifted his son onto his lap. &#39;Your brain is much too good to be worn out by a little thinking. But now, let me solve this mystery for you. The day we are going to celebrate happened ten years ago. It was one of the most important days of my life, and one of the happiest. Everyone I knew was gathered at The Oaks, and your grandmother Rose had decorated the house with white roses and evergreens. I can still remember the wonderful smell of those flowers.&#39; &#39;Was Mamma there, too?&#39; Eddie asked. &#39;Indeed she was, Son. She was the center of attention.&#39; Edward&#39;s voice had softened as the image of his wife formed in his memory. &#39;She was wearing the most beautiful gown of white satin and lace. She had flowers in her hair, silk orange blossoms as I recall, and a veil of the finest silk net. She carried a bouquet of white roses, and she looked just like a princess.&#39; Eddie had begun to squirm with excitement. &#39;I know now, Papa!&#39; he exclaimed. &#39;It was Mamma in the picture of your wedding!&#39; Edward gave the boy a hug and declared, &#39;That&#39;s it, Son. You&#39;ve solved the mystery with just a few hints.&#39; Eddie beamed and his little chest swelled with pride. &#39;Then our party is for your wedding,&#39; he said with satisfaction. &#39;It will be your mother&#39;s and my anniversary,&#39; Edward explained. &#39;Do you remember when we attended your grandparents&#39; anniversary dinner at The Oaks?&#39; Eddie nodded. &#39;Well, this will be a similar evening,&#39; his father continued. &#39;Your mother and I have been married for ten years, and we have been blessed in each one of those years. God has given us five splendid children, and you and your sisters and brothers have each made us even happier than we were on our wedding day. So we want to share our good fortune and our thanks to our Heavenly Father with all our friends and loved ones. And that is why your mother and Aunt Chloe and all the servants are working so hard on this party.&#39; &#39;What was that word, Papa? Anna...anna...&#39; &#39;Anniversary, my boy. An anniversary is the day that marks every year that passes after an important event.&#39; &#39;An-ni-ver-sary,&#39; Eddie said slowly so that he would remember the word. &#39;Will I be able to come?&#39; he asked anxiously. &#39;Oh, yes, my boy. Your mother and I have agreed that you and Missy will be allowed a late evening for the party. Even Vi and the twins are invited.&#39; &#39;But they can&#39;t stay up late, can they?&#39; &#39;No, for they are very young, and we don&#39;t want them overly excited,&#39; Edward said in a man-to-man tone. &#39;&#39;Course not, Papa,&#39; Eddie replied seriously. &#39;They&#39;re too little for all the &#39;citement, and they&#39;ll cry. But Missy and me know how to be good at a party.&#39; &#39;And I know that I can count on your good behavior, Son. That&#39;s why you may stay up until nine o&#39;clock that night.&#39; Eddie was amazed, for he had never been allowed so late a bedtime before, not even on Christmas Eve. &#39;I&#39;ll be very good for you, Papa. I promise,&#39; he said in a whisper. A few minutes later the bell for breakfast rang out. Edward and Eddie, who were having their chat in the sitting room of Ion, hurried to join the family in the dining room. The twins, born the previous spring, had already been fed and were in the nursery, but everyone else was present. Edward hurried to help his wife to her seat at the head of the table, and Missy---now nine and so like her mother in appearance that strangers sometimes mistook them for older and younger sisters---took her chair. Eddie sat opposite her, and Violet, a vivacious three-year-old, sat in her high chair between Eddie and their mother. Edward sat down last, and the table was immediately silent as all heads were bowed and little hands were clasped. In words both simple and heartfelt, Edward asked God&#39;s blessing on the food and gave thanks for the bounty that they were about to receive. When the prayer was finished, a servant began passing the dishes from person to person. Following the customs she had learned from her own father, Elsie filled Vi&#39;s plate with warm stewed apples and gave the little girl a slice of fresh bread and a piece of golden cheese. Each of the children also received a glass of milk, and in addition to their fruit and bread, Missy and Eddie were given a poached egg---a recent addition to their breakfast menu. As the family ate, they conversed about plans for the coming day. Missy and Eddie quite naturally were anxious to know about the plans for the upcoming party.</p><h2>Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession</h2><p>The author of Working and Hard Times examines the leading issue in American politics, presenting the feelings of nearly one hundred Americans on such issues as affirmative action, changing neighborhoods, secret prejudices, and more.</p><p>America&#39;s foremost oral historian tackles the most difficult and complicated issue in America today -- race relations -- by interviewing nearly a hundred blacks and whites.

Lidia Bastianich introduced us to Italian cooking. Now Daisy Martinez will introduce all of America to Latin cooking-her way. In a country where salsa now outsells ketchup, Daisy Martinez is out on a mission to change the way we cook. In her new cookbook, a tie-in to her public television show, Daisy introduces us to the mouthwatering meals of her Latin ancestry-and not just to the pork, beans, rice, and burritos many people associate with Latino culture. Here are Stuffed Yucca Fritters, Peruvian Minestrone, and Braised Chicken with Figs, to name just a few. By combining the delicious flavor of Latino cultures with ingredients available in any kitchen, Daisy shows us how to -daisy-fy+ regular meals and turn them into something extraordinary.Divided into twelve chapters such as Turnovers and Tamales, Appetizers and Little Bites, Soups and One-Bowl Meals, and Chicken, Duck, and Turkey, and filled with more than 200 recipes and color photographs throughout, this is a cookbook that will introduce a new culinary star.Special features in the book include: l-Daisy+s Top Ten: palate-rocking staple dishes and condiments that will expand your repertoire.l-Daisy+s Corner: a series of essays about the intersection of food, family, and culture.</p><p><strong>Daisy Maria Martinez</strong> was born to mainland Puerto Rican parents in Brooklyn, New York, where she lived at her grandmother's house until she was almost five years old. Her extended family includes relatives from Central America, Spain, and other parts of the Spanish-speaking world. She has modeled and acted in commercials and in numerous films including <em>Carlito's Way</em> and <em>Scent of a Woman</em>. She attended Long Island University and the French Culinary Institute before establishing her catering business, The Passionate Palate. Daisy lives with her husband and children in Brooklyn.Martinez serves up a jazzy tie-in to her new public television cooking show of the same name, and while the subtitle's claim that the recipes within will "rock your world" is pure hyperbole, Martinez does offer a decent introduction to Latin "soul food." The overly chirpy tone can feel cloying, yet Martinez succeeds in demystifying staples of Latin cooking. Starting with important such basics as Sofrito (a blend of onions, peppers, tomatoes and herbs that adds "zing" to dishes), Achiote Oil (which also adds a "quick kick") and Recaito (a Sofrito-like seasoning, sans the color and extra liquid), she moves on to tapas, soups, meats, vegetables, starches and desserts. Recipes for the truly cooking-impaired (e.g., Guacamole, Black Beans, Basic White Rice) are unnecessary, but exotic dishes like Breadfruit Tostones (twice-fried crispy chips), Sole Baked in a Banana Leaf, and Stuffed Flank Steak are welcome. Health-conscious readers, beware: this cuisine is laden with animal products, carbs and things fried and refried, and Martinez admits to leaning toward too-large portions, which she calls "Daisy Servings." Still, anyone new to Latin classics like Paella, Ropa Vieja, and Dulce de Leche should find plenty of motivation within these colorful pages.

Beginning with a section on perception, the authors emphasize how the artist can learn to be open to the painting experience, both consciously and unconsciously. They then discuss composition in terms of the elements of shape, pattern, planes, positive/negative space, and dynamics of movement. The next section explores the influences on composition of value and mass, light and shade, texture, proportion, and perspective. Finally, the authors specify creative approaches which the artist can experiment with to increase compositional skill and painting facility.

Visiting Japan in 1902 and again in 1907, he fell in love with the country&#x2019;s distinctive cherry blossoms, or&nbsp;<i>sakura,</i> and brought back hundreds of cuttings with him to England, where he created a garden of cherry varieties.<br><br> On a 1926 trip to Japan to search for new specimens, Ingram was shocked to find a dramatic decline in local cherry diversity. A cloned variety was taking over the landscape and becoming the symbol of Japan&#x2019;s expansionist ambitions, while the rare and spectacular <i>Taihaku,</i> or &#x201c;Great White Cherry,&#x201d; had disappeared entirely. <br><br> But thousands of miles away, at Ingram&#x2019;s country estate, the <i>Taihaku</i> still prospered. After returning to Britain, the amateur botanist buried a living cutting from his own collection into a potato and repatriated it to Japan via the Trans-Siberian Express. Over the decades that followed, Ingram became one of the world&#x2019;s leading cherry experts and shared the joy of <i>sakura </i>both nationally and internationally, sending more than a hundred varieties of cherry tree to new homes around the globe, from Auckland, New Zealand to Washington, D.C.<br><br> As much a history of the cherry blossom in Japan as it is the story of one remarkable man, <i>The Sakura Obsession </i>follows the flower from its significance as a symbol of the imperial court, through the dark days of the Second World War, and up to the present-day worldwide fascination with this iconic blossom.</p><p>Naoko Abe is a Japanese journalist and nonfiction writer.

Within the hat, the bird had fashioned a nest using fur pulled from Collingwood&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s sable cap and bedroom slippers. In the nest, the jackdaw, drawn as she was to shiny objects, had stored a silver pen and some forks.<br><br> When a servant rang the gong to announce meals, Darlie flew to the dining room and hopped around the table, helping herself to morsels from each plate. Joining Darlie on these culinary circuits were four albino, or leucistic, sparrows &#x2013; Isidor, Tiny, Wildie and Zimbi &#x2013; along with Albine and Bil-Bil, two pink-eyed albino blackbirds that loved scoffing hard-boiled eggs. There were at least a dozen other albino birds in the house, including thrushes, a hedge sparrow, a redpoll, a starling and a swallow. <br><br> The genetic mutation that these birds carried left them with poor eyesight, poor hearing and an ever poorer chance of finding a mate, and their survival outdoors was not assured. So Collingwood and his mother, Mary, kept the birds indoors, where they lived as part of the family, even travelling with them on overseas trips. When Darlie died, Collingwood and Mary set aside a corner of a cabinet in her memory, in which they placed photographs of her, five of her eggs in cotton wool and a brooch containing her feathers. John Jenner Weir, a friend of Charles Darwin and a significant inspiration to the young Collingwood, would call Darlie &#x2018;the most charming bird it has ever been my fate to meet with&#x2019;.<br><br> History doesn&#x2019;t record whether Jenner Weir had any comment about the Ingrams&#x2019; other compulsion: Japanese Chin dogs. Bred and prized by Japanese nobility and samurai lords, these flat-faced, wide-eyed pets resembled Persian cats in many ways. Having been brought to England after Japan opened its doors to the West in the 1850s, the tiny dogs became exotic fixtures in moneyed households throughout Europe. Queen Alexandra, for instance, who had married the future King Edward VII in 1863, had been given a Chin soon after her wedding and had helped to popularise the breed. The Ingrams so loved these dogs that at Westgate-on-Sea, their second home, they kept as many as thirty-five Chins at one time.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Mary Ingram and some of her Japanese Chin dogs</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Each Chin had distinct variations. Most were black and white, but others were red and white, or gold and black. After dinner, according to Collingwood Ingram&#x2019;s cousin, Edward Stirling Booth, the Chins were &#x2018;brought in like a set of children into the drawing room for a short time with two dog nurses in attendance. The dogs used to have very particular habits with regard to meals. Every dog had to be completely indulged. Occasionally one little dog would be rushed out and brought back again, and then another one would be rushed out and brought back again. This was another thing which visitors had to put up with.&#x2019; Booth also noted the presence in the Ingrams&#x2019; extensive garden of an African wildebeest. <br><br> Even in Victorian Britain, where the foibles of the wealthy were generally indulged, the Ingrams&#x2019; collections marked them as atypical. And there was no doubt, among the residents of Westgate-on-Sea, that the Ingrams were unusual. Unusually wealthy, too. The family head was Collingwood&#x2019;s proud father, Sir William James Ingram, the Liberal Party&#x2019;s Member of Parliament for Boston, Lincolnshire. He was also managing director of <i>The</i> <i>Illustrated London News</i>, one of Britain&#x2019;s most influential and popular newspapers. Willie, as his friends called him, was an energetic big thinker, much like his father Herbert, the newspaper&#x2019;s founder. Sir William&#x2019;s many critics had other descriptions for him, considering him arrogant, litigious and unforgiving, as indeed they had his father. Further detractors included Sir William&#x2019;s five sisters and his mother, Ann, whose remarriage in 1892 at the age of eighty would plunge the family into open warfare. <br><br> Sir William&#x2019;s wife, Mary Eliza Collingwood Ingram, was an Australian whose accent had been smoothed out by elocution lessons in London. The couple, both passionate about birds and the natural world, had met in London and married in November 1874 at Christ Church, Paddington. Their three boys, who called their parents Min and Pids, completed the quintet. The eldest, Herbert or Bertie, and his brother, Bruce, attended an elite boarding school, Winchester College, their father&#x2019;s alma mater.<br><br> Collingwood, the baby of the family and a sickly child, had never attended school. So while Bertie studied Virgil&#x2019;s Aeneid, Collingwood roamed the countryside, studying birds &#x2013; wagtails and warblers, whinchats and wrynecks. And while Bruce learned about <i>Whistler&#x2019;s Mother</i> and Constable&#x2019;s <i>The Hay Wain</i>, Collingwood learned to whistle the <i>whit-whit</i> call of the quail in the marshes of East Sussex. From his earliest childhood, birds were Collingwood&#x2019;s fixation. At the age of three, his Norwegian nurse had held him over a shrub to look into a hedge sparrow&#x2019;s nest containing a clutch of turquoise-blue eggs. &#x2018;The study of birds,&#x2019; he later recalled, &#x2018;and in particular the study of their nests and young became an obsession with me &#x2013; an obsession that persisted for at least half of my life.&#x2019; <br><br> Nature was the boy&#x2019;s religion, and Darwinism his creed. And one day in 1891, quite by chance, he ran into John Jenner Weir, one of Britain&#x2019;s most accomplished ornithologists and botanists. That meeting, Ingram recalled, was a transformational, almost evangelical experience: &#x2018;The manner in which I came to know that stranger has remained an inexplicable episode in my life.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br><br> I was only about 10, a shy introspective child who in normal circumstances would have never dreamt of accosting a perfect stranger. Yet that was exactly what I did. I was wandering about the countryside by myself in search of birds, when I saw coming towards me, also alone, an elderly gentleman dressed from head to foot in urban black. He might have been anything &#x2013; a lawyer, a doctor, a businessman. <br><br> There was therefore no ostensible reason why I should have suddenly felt irresistibly drawn towards the man. Was it telepathy or was it intuition? I know not. Anyhow, something seemed to tell me that here at last I had found a kindred spirit. Impelled by an uncontrollable urge, I walked straight up to him, and without so much as a word of explanation, bluntly asked him if he was interested in birds &#x2013; a fatuous question since I already instinctively knew the answer.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> In fact, Jenner Weir kept birds and butterflies in an aviary in his garden in south London, where he experimented to see which variety and colour of caterpillars the birds would eat. Darwin cited a number of Jenner Weir&#x2019;s observations in <i>The Descent of Man</i> and other books. For three formative years after they met, Jenner Weir lent Collingwood materials and books about the natural world. He died suddenly in March 1894, aged seventy-one, when his young admirer was just thirteen, but his influence lasted throughout Ingram&#x2019;s life. In his final publication, <i>Random Thoughts on Birds</i>, self-published when he was ninety-eight years old, Ingram wrote of his &#x2018;deepest gratitude for his [Jenner Weir&#x2019;s] encouragement&#x2019;.<br><br> Collingwood was already passionate about collecting all varieties of fauna that interested him. His meetings and correspondence with Jenner Weir further encouraged those pastimes. Diverse species must be protected and preserved: that, to Collingwood, was a given. Indeed, it was variety that made life so rich and fulfilling for him. <br><br> Darwin&#x2019;s theories of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection &#x2013; the &#x2018;survival of the fittest&#x2019; &#x2013; which Collingwood discussed with Jenner Weir, argued against the natural survival of the family&#x2019;s albino birds, yet survive they did, at least in small numbers; just as Collingwood himself had defied the odds at his birth and would live for more than 100 years.</p><h2>The Pit Dragon Trilogy</h2><p>Used, Very Good Condition, Clean, Kept Smoke Free Environment</p><p></p><h2>The Dog Who Bit a Policeman</h2><p>As Russian mafia members begin to be the targets of a series of murders, Inspector Rostnikov investigates, but two undercover agents are closer to the truth as they try to determine who is behind an illegal dog fighting ring in Moscow</p><p>Stuart M. Kaminsky won an Edgar for <i>A Cold Red Sunrise</i>, the fourth book in his deliciously mordant series about Moscow cop Porfiry Rostnikov, and number 12, <i>The Dog Who Bit a Policeman</i>, might be even better. Rostnikov, a one-legged inspector who lifts weights and sleeps in a black T-shirt emblazoned with "The Truth Is Out There" in white letters, is one of the most engaging and relevant characters in recent crime fiction, a sharp and caring policeman as well as the perfect tour guide to a changing (that is, disintegrating) Russia. Now working in the Office of Special Investigation under a corrupt but efficient boss known as the Yak, Rostnikov has been promoted and promised full support "if one or more of the varied criminal organizations and the confused state bureaucracy attempted to impede the performance of his duties. Up to now, the Yak had been as good as his word and had successfully bought the loyalty of Rostnikov and his staff." That staff, as rich as in a work by Gogol, includes a mad pathologist who talks to cadavers; an obsessive detective called Emil Karpo, "the Vampire," who spends "all his waking hours relentlessly pursuing criminals from both the past and present"; and Rostnikov's son Iosef, a failed actor/playwright and veteran of the war in Afghanistan. While Porfiry and Karpo try to head off a war between two Mafia leaders, Iosef and his partner are looking into the latest disappearance of a popular, Yeltsinesque politician with a drinking problem. Another pair of detectives pose as Ukrainian high rollers to infiltrate a burgeoning business in illegal dogfights--hence the possibly ungrammatical (shouldn't it be "The Dog That..." rather than "The Dog Who..."?) but definitely appropriate title for this beautifully researched and energetically written story. <i>--Dick Adler</i><p>Stuart M.

Over the course fo a century, bustling commerce grew up between East and West, carried on the decks and in the holds of great sailing ships and steam-powered vessels. Maxtone-Graham and Marshall bring to life this remarkable era.</p><p>As a child, Ian Marshall made his own "passage to India" through the Suez Canal aboard one of the great British luxury liners that carried everyone from military men to ladies' maids to the East. Marshall grew up to be an architect, but his love of the sea and the ships that sailed it never abated; he turned his artistic talents to portraiture, producing two books of maritime watercolors, <i>Armored Ships</i> and <i>Ironclads and Paddlers</i>, which captured exactly the power and majesty of warships. In <i>Passage East</i>, he does it again, this time evoking an era of privilege and class consciousness that vanished along with the Raj. Photographs and sketches illuminate Marshall's text and all work together to make this both a beautiful piece of art and a fascinating work of history. An added bonus is the detailed introductory essay by marine historian John Maxtone-Graham.Ian Marshall is a member of the American Academy of Marine Artists and the author of two other books of maritime paintings, ARMORED SHIPS and IRONCLADS AND PADDLERS.</p><h2>The Classical Cookbook</h2><p>The daily life of classical Greece and Rome, although separated from us by 2000 years, can be recreated in almost photographic detail. <em>The Classical Cookbook</em> is the first book of its kind, exploring the daily culture of the Mediterranean through the center of its social life--food and drink. Combining narrative texts and recipes, authors Dalby and Grainger draw on a mass of fascinating resources to describe household life for different social groups and occasions. Each chapter provides a historical outline, with translations of the original recipes followed by versions for the modern cook. The book is illustrated throughout with delightful scenes of food, hunters, and revelers from wall paintings, mosaics, and Greek vases. And the array of delicacies, from Sweet Wine Scones to Chicken Stuffed with Olives to Honey Nut Cake, is sure to tempt any connoisseur.</p><p><i>The Classical Cookbook</i> combines carefully researched history with recipes that are interpretations of ancient Greece and Rome. Two Britons, historian Andrew Dalby and chef Sally Grainger, collaborated on this book, which discusses the banquets and feasts of Athens and Rome, but focuses mostly on how average people ate every day. Many of the seasonings favored from around 700 B.C. up to the fall of Rome in the 5th century, it turns out, are not that foreign to what we use today: leeks, nuts, vinegar, wine. The authors provide easy equivalents for the more exotic ingredients. Imagine how Socrates, in the 1st century, may have enjoyed honey-glazed shrimp or cheesecake. Such dishes make it tempting to try the culinary adaptations of classical cookery. Here's a rare example of history brought to life.<br><strong>Andrew Dalby</strong> is librarian of the London House for Overseas Graduates and has written for numerous food history and classics journals. <strong>Sally Grainger</strong> is a professional pastry chef and regularly organizes Roman banquets.<br></p><h2>How to Make Love All Night (And Drive a Woman Wild : Male Multiple Orgasm and Other Secrets for Prolonged Lovemaking)</h2><p>An experienced therapist and sex surrogate combines ancient techniques with modern knowledge to help men, and the women who are their partners, get the most possible pleasure out of lovemaking by increasing its duration and intensity</p><p>From the author of <i>Sexual Pleasure</i> and <i>Sexual Healing</i> comes this remarkable book that will help men achieve a new kind of pleasure in bed--and please their partners in the process.

Without requiring any formal commitment to Wicca and its beliefs, this one-of-a-kind collection emphasizes simple recipes using ingredients at their seasonal peak, from Rose Petal Jam and Dandelion Wine to Medieval Honey Cakes and, of course, Witches' Brew. Whether youvre a practicing Wiccan or an adventurous cook, THE WICCA COOKBOOK is a charming and historically accurate tome to be treasured. Organized according to eight naturebased festivals called sabbats, it offers a variety of main dishes, side dishes, desserts, and drinks. &nbsp;</p><p>TARA SEEFELDT, a practicing Wiccan, teaches cooking classes while earning her Ph.D. in medieval history. She lives in Arizona.<br>JAMIE WOOD has formally practiced various forms of Wicca for more than ten years, and strongly identifies with the faery tradition. Jamie leads workshops, lectures, and retreats on manifesting the Divine and earth-based spirituality in everyday life. She is the author of THE TEEN SPELL BOOK and THE WICCA HERBAL and the coauthor of THE WICCA COOKBOOK. Jamie lives in California with her husband and two sons.A witches' cookbook need not be simply a hodgepodge of recipes calling for "eye of newt." Wood has compiled <i>The Wicca Cookbook </i> to inform followers of the relationship of ancient paganism to eating. Those merely curious about this nature-based religion will also find good information here. Spell-casting and creation of sacred spaces precede a discussion of medieval cookery, source of many of these updated recipes. Nature forming the core of this religion, the authors organize recipes through seasons from Candlemas into the dark days of winter solstice.

Thompson, Ames and Taibbi cover everything from decadent club scenes to the nation&#39;s collapsing political and economic systems - no person or institution is spared from their razor sharp satiric viewpoint. They take you beneath the surface of the Russia that most Western journalists cover, bringing to life the metropolis that Ames describes as &#34;manic, nihilistic, grotesque, horrible; and yet, in its own way, far superior to any city on Earth.&#34; Featuring artwork and articles from their groundbreaking newspaper, The eXile is the inside story of how the tabloid came to be and how Ames and Taibbi broke their biggest stories - all the while playing hysterically vicious practical jokes, racking up innumerable death threats, and ingesting a motherlode of speed. It&#39;s a darkly funny, up-close profile of the sordid underbelly of the New World Order that you will never forget.</p><p>In 1997, two American college-educated slackers began publishing the eXile, a no-holds-barred newspaper, in Moscow. The paper includes irreverent discussions of Russia's sex and drug scene and off-color humor pieces, such as an article poking fun at a U.S. African-American basketball player who was toiling for a Moscow team after he was kicked out of the NBA following a forced sodomy charge in the U.S. Their attitude toward Russia's expatriate community, including themselves, is clear: "Any affluent or even middle-class American who renounces the good life of sushi and 50-channel cable delivery" is "motivated by a highly destructive personality defect." The pranks the newspaper plays are entertaining: convincing an aide to Mikhail Gorbachev that New York Jets football coach Bill Parcells wanted the former Soviet leader to give a series of inspirational pep talks to his team, for example. The eXile also takes on the herd mentality of reporters, managing to convince one of its rival papers that basketball hall-of-famer Wilt Chamberlain was considering a comeback in Russia. (In between its humor and its testosterone, the eXile has reported some important stories, most notably that much aid money from the U.S. went directly into the hands of some top Russian politicians.) Only those with a National Lampoon mentality will enjoy the descriptions of the editors' sexual conquests and their comparisons of Russian and American women. Like much of the paper itself, the book, which recounts the newspaper's history, is tasteless. There's little doubt, however, that both incisively probe contemporary Russian reality--and the expatriate mindset. (Mar.) <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.Full of drugs, sex, and booze, this book initially strikes one as an ode to bad taste. The authors, editors of the English-language Moscow tabloid newspaper The eXile, know this: "we stood for all the wrong things--but at least we weren't bores." True enough. Still, Chapter 3 has good reporting on USAID, the World Bank/IMF, and the Investor Protection Fund and how they waste money and benefit the Russian rich. Similarly, Chapter 8 contains news items (e.g., former Yeltsin adviser Anatoly Chubais's "loans-for-shares" auctions) incorrectly analyzed in the Moscow press, along with the correct analysis by the editors of The eXile. The authors also describe The eXile's first year, 1997, which one editor saw as his "first experience...with taking life seriously." Like most coming-of-age stories, this is bittersweet.

However, these tales don't follow traditional plot structures or character-development methods. They read more like travelogues, or socio-anthropological articles on foreign nations or tribes. They explore exotic literary planes lying somewhere between Jorge Luis Borges's <i>ficciones</i> and Horace Miner's anthropological satire <i>Body Ritual Among the Nacirema</i>. However, unlike Miner's parody, Le Guin's wise tales are rarely satirical, though "The Royals of Hegn" sharply skewers the absurdity of royalty-worship, and "Great Joy" rightly attacks the boundless corporate criminality familiar to anyone who's read a newspaper since 2001.</p><p> One of America's greatest authors, Ursula K.

These predictions tended, however, to run toward the non-specific. Things like: Something terrible will happen to you today. It might involve the number six. Or: Money is coming. Open your hand for it. Or: You have a big decision and it will not make itself. </p><p> The people who came to the little, bright blue house at 300 Fox Way didn't mind the imprecise nature of their fortunes. It became a game, a challenge, to realize the exact moment that the predictions came true. When a van carrying six people wheeled into a client's car two weeks after their psychic reading, he could nod with a sense of accomplishment and release. When a neighbor offered to buy another client's old chainsaw if they were looking for a bit of extra cash, she could recall the promise of money coming and sell it with the sense that the transaction had been foretold. Or when a third client heard his wife say this is a decision that has to be made, he could remember the same words being said by Maura Sargent over a spread of tarot cards and then leap decisively to action. </p></i><p><i> But the imprecise nature of the fortunes kept them from feeling complete. They could be dismissed as coincidences, hunches. They were a chuckle in the Wal-mart parking lot when you ran into an old friend as promised. A shiver when the number seventeen appeared in an electric bill. A realization that even if you had discovered the future, it really didn't change how you lived the present.

Forged antiquities. A country at war. A camel in the garden. A cameo by Lawrence of Arabia. Add in Peters&#x2019;s trademark intelligent plotting, engaging characters, and stylish writing and we can hardly ask for anything more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most beloved characters in mystery/suspense fiction, archeologist and Egyptologist Amelia Peabody bravely faces gravest peril in Cairo on the eve of World War One in <i>New York Times </i>bestselling Grandmaster Elizabeth Peters&#x2019;s magnificent Egyptian adventure, <i>He Shall Thunder in the Sky.</i> The <i>San Francisco Examiner </i>calls these heart-racing exploits of Amelia and her courageous family, the Emersons, &#x201c;pure delight.&#x201d; But perhaps the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> states it best: &#x201c;Between Amelia Peabody and Indiana Jones, it&#x2019;s Amelia&#x2014;in wit and daring&#x2014;by a landslide.&#x201d;</p></p><p><i>He Shall Thunder in the Sky</i> completes an internal quartet (which also includes <i>Seeing a Large Cat</i>, <i>The Ape Who Guards the Balance</i>, and <i>The Falcon at the Portal</i>) within Elizabeth Peters's legendary series starring Amelia Peabody, the intrepid Edwardian Egyptologist, her husband, Emerson, and her extended family. The quartet comprises not only Amelia's diary of those years but also parts of a mysterious "Manuscript H," an omniscient viewpoint that allows a glimpse into the minds of Amelia's son--the dashing and brilliant Ramses--and her ward, Nefret Forth, as they mature into adults with their own secrets and agendas. <i>The Falcon at the Portal</i> left readers hanging impatiently in the enormous rift that book's events gouged between Ramses and Nefret, both madly in love but unrelentingly proud. <p> The winter of 1914-15 finds the Peabody-Emerson family back in Cairo--now under British martial law, with the Suez Canal under constant threat of attack from the Ottoman Empire. The city's young Englishmen are rushing to enlist, except for Ramses, who is widely scorned for his pacifism. Yet Amelia and Emerson soon find out that Ramses is (literally) playing a mysterious and potentially explosive part in the conflict between Egyptian nationalists and the British authorities, for reasons both political and familial. Nefret, for her part, is still running a health clinic for the city's fallen women and trying to avoid the attentions of Percy, Amelia's odious nephew. In the meantime, the Emersons' excavations at Giza reveal an unexpected treasure so remarkable that the uneasy Amelia immediately senses the fine hand of Sethos, the Master Criminal (who through many previous books has alternately plagued her and protested his boundless affection for her), at work. The climax and denouement are entirely worth the price of admission--tying up a decade's worth of loose strings and explaining some nagging points so subtle that less observant readers might easily have missed them. It's Peters's great gift that in the grand scheme of things, no clues are wasted. Her plotting is wonderfully complex and intriguing, and it fits seamlessly into the detailed historical background she builds so carefully. It may have taken years for her to complete this four-part dance (she promises more Amelia Peabody mysteries in the future), but she's charmed us right out of our dancing slippers along the way. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p><blockquote><em>There are dark storm clouds gathering above a land of mystery and antiquity. And no one will escape the fury of the tempest to come.</em></blockquote><p><b>He Shall Thunder In The Sky</b></p><p>Egypt and her hoary secrets are no match for <em>New York Times-bestselling</em> Grandmaster Elizabeth Peters and her indomitable archaeologist sleuth Amelia Peabody. The sand-and-wind blown ambience of this strange and colorful world, the ancient enchantments and delicious menace are more vibrantly realized than ever in this thrilling new adventure that places the intrepid Amelia and her equally remarkable family in the dangerous path of an onrushing World War.</p><p>The pursuit of knowledge must never be deterred by Man's folly. So the close of 1914 finds Amelia Peabody and her husband Radcliffe Emerson back in Egypt for another season of archaeological excavation--despite the increasing danger of an attack on the Suez Canal and on Egypt itself. Trouble is brewing in Cairo and the defiantly pacifist stance of Amelia and Emerson's headstrong son Ramses is earning the young man the derision, and much worse, of the British expatriate community. Meanwhile, the charismatic nationalist <em>el Wardani </em>is said to be fomenting insurrection in the ancient city. And since there is no way to stand outside the political hurricane that is suddenly threatening their lives, Amelia plunges directly into it.</p><p>When <em>el Wardani</em> escapes a police dragnet, thanks to the direct intervention of Amelia and Emerson, the family's stake in a perilous game is raised considerably. But it's Ramses' strange secret role in it that could truly bring ruin down upon all their heads. However, there is more than intrigue and espionage, plots and counterplots, at work here. For an artifact uncovered at a Giza dig--an exquisite sculpture found where it ought not to be confirms Amelia's most unsettling suspicion: that the chaos consuming Cairo has masked the nefarious re-emergence of Amelia's villainous archnemesis, Sethos, the Master Criminal.</p><p>The extraordinary Elizabeth Peters raises exotic intrigue to a new level with <em>He Shall Thunder in the Sky</em>. If you have never before experienced Amelia and her singular clan, prepare to be enthralled by the droll wit, the richly evoked locale, and a story that twists sensuously and mysteriously like an asp writhing beneath the desert sun. And longtime devotees will relish the return of dear friends--and await the resolution of a love affair that may change the Emersons' destiny forever.</p></p><h2>RN Pharmacology for Nursing Edition 7. 0</h2><p>rn pharmacology for nursing edition 7 review module [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2016] ati</p><p></p><h2>Season with Authority: Confident Home Cooking</h2><p><b>Over 130 comfort food classics revisited by <i>Chopped </i>judge and one of New York's favorite chefs</b><br><br> Marc Murphy has been cooking in the finest kitchens in the world for nearly 30 years.

She lives in New York City.A blizzard leaves a peasant family housebound at Hanukkah with the potatoes for latkes buried under the snowdrifts. There are no apples for applesauce, either, since the harvest was poor. But when the family takes in first a stray cat and later a stray dog, the two animals return the favor. On the eighth night of celebration, when the storm finally clears and the nearly starving group ventures out, the dog digs potatoes and the cat mews in the apple tree where apples are miraculously now hanging. Curious children may well ask why the family didn't prepare by digging potatoes before the holiday. Nevertheless, this gentle story is well served by Spowart's earth-toned chalk illustrations that depict the family in rounded shapes with an economy of detail.

For a start, two of the girls, Unity and Diana, were Fascists (the former was a friend of Hitler and Goebbels, and the latter married Sir Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Union of Fascists). Two others took the writing route: Jessica ran away from home and became a famous muckraking journalist, and Nancy composed maliciously witty--and transparently autobiographical--novels as well as several biographies. <i>The Pursuit of Love</i> (1945), her greatest fictional success, and its companion, <i>Love in a Cold Climate</i> (1949), keep closely to the spirit (and details) of their youthful amusements and more grown-up adventures.<p> Seen through the adoring eyes of Fanny Logan, the self-effacing cousin who records their shenanigans with a wicked sincerity, the Radletts of Alconleigh shine with Gloucestershire glamour: apoplectic Uncle Matthew; Lord Alconleigh (modeled to a fine nuance after Mitford's father, Lord Redesdale, who like Uncle Matthew used to hunt his children with bloodhounds); his kind, rather vague wife, Aunt Sadie; as well as Fanny's favorite cousin Linda and the other six Radlett children. The Radlett daughters and Fanny wait impatiently for life to become interesting. Because of their station, however, nothing but marriage is expected of them, so they hurl themselves at love like crusaders, with varied and always fascinating results. At one point Fanny recounts: </p><blockquote> A few minutes only after Linda had left me to go back to London, Christian and the comrades, I had another caller. This time it was Lord Merlin...."This is a bad business," he said, abruptly, and without preamble, though I had not seen him for several years. "I'm just back from Rome, and what do I find--Linda and Christian Talbot. It's an extraordinary thing that I can't ever leave England without Linda getting herself mixed up with some thoroughly undesirable character. This is a disaster--how far has it gone? Can nothing be done?" </blockquote> <i>The Pursuit of Love</i> follows the romantic fortunes of Linda Radlett, while <i>Love in a Cold Climate</i> ventures further afield with the story of Polly Hampton's shocking love affair and its unexpectedly funny aftermath. Fanny's inexhaustible narration is a pleasant buffer for Mitford's deft teasing, which dances along just this side of mockery. The author of <i>U and Non-U</i>, a famous tongue-in-cheek treatise on the shibboleths of upper-class mores, Mitford often leaves the reader wondering just where she stands in the class wars, and much of her humor arises in the fine distinctions of aristocratic manners and speech. Still, there's an inimitable tart sweetness to these stories of true love and its pallid imitators, making them perfect snapshots of a vanished world. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i>Few aristocratic English families of the twentieth century enjoyed the glamorous notoriety of the infamous Mitford sisters. Nancy Mitford's most famous novels, <b>The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate</b>, satirize British aristocracy in the twenties and thirties through the amorous adventures of the Radletts, an exuberantly unconventional family closely modelled on Mitford's own.<br><br>The Radletts of Alconleigh occupy the heights of genteel eccentricity, from terrifying Lord Alconleigh (who, like Mitford's father, used to hunt his children with bloodhounds when foxes were not available), to his gentle wife, Sadie, their wayward daughter Linda, and the other six lively Radlett children. Mitford's wickedly funny prose follows these characters through misguided marriages and dramatic love affairs, as the shadow of World War II begins to close in on their rapidly vanishing world.</p><h2>See How It&#39;s Made</h2><p>Filled with step-by-step photographs, a start-to-finish look at how everyday objects are made explores the design, technology, and manufacture of more than twenty common household items. 35,000 first printing.</p><p></p><h2>Nothing by Chance</h2><p>The author describes his adventures during the summer of 1966, when he emulated the gypsy pilots of the 1920s and barnstormed across America</p><p></p><h2>The Spiral Staircase: My Climb Out of Darkness</h2><p>Karen Armstrong begins this spellbinding story of her spiritual journey with her departure in 1969 from the Roman Catholic convent she had entered seven years before&#x2014;hoping, but ultimately failing, to find God. She knew almost nothing of the changed world to which she was returning, and she was tormented by panic attacks and inexplicable seizures.<br><br>Armstrong&#x2019;s struggle against despair was further fueled by a string of discouragements&#x2014;failed spirituality, doctorate, and jobs; fruitless dealings with psychiatrists. Finally, in 1976, she was diagnosed with epilepsy, given proper treatment, and released from her &#x201c;private hell.&#x201d; She then began the writing career that would become her true calling, and as she focused on the sacred texts of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, her own inner story began to emerge. Without realizing it, she had embarked on a spiritual quest, and through it she would eventually experience moments of transcendence&#x2014;the profound fulfillment that she had not found in long hours of prayer as a young nun.<br><br>Powerfully engaging, often heartbreaking, but lit with bursts of humor, <i>The Spiral Staircase</i> is an extraordinary history of self.</p><p>Karen Armstrong speaks to the troubling years following her decision to leave the life of a Roman Catholic nun and join the secular world in 1969. What makes this memoir especially fascinating is that Armstrong already wrote about this era once---only it was a disastrous book. It was too soon for her to understand how these dark, struggling years influenced her spiritual development, and she was too immature to protect herself from being be bullied by the publishing world. As a result, she agreed to portray herself only in as "positive and lively a light as possible"---a mandate that gave her permission to deny the truth of her pain and falsify her inner experience. The inspiration for this new approach comes from T. S. Eliot's <i>Ash Wednesday</i>, a series of six poems that speak to the process of spiritual recovery. Eliot metaphorically climbs a spiral staircase in these poems---turning again and again to what he does not want to see as he slowly makes progress toward the light. In revisiting her spiral climb out of her dark night of the soul, Armstrong gives readers a stunningly poignant account about the nature of spiritual growth. Upon leaving the convent, Armstrong grapples with the grief of her abandoned path and the uncertainty of her place in the world. On top of this angst, Armstrong spent years suffering from undiagnosed temporal lobe epilepsy, causing her to have frequent blackout lapses in memory and disturbing hallucinations---crippling symptoms that her psychiatrist adamantly attributed to Armstrong's denial of her femininity and sexuality. The details of this narrative may be specific to Armstrong's life, but the meanin! g she makes of her spiral ascent makes this a universally relevant story. All readers can glean inspiration from her insights into the nature of surrender and the possibilities of finding solace in the absence of hope. Armstrong shows us why spiritual wisdom is often a seasoned gift---no matter how much we strive for understanding, we can't force profound insights to occur simply because our publisher is waiting for them. With her elegant, humble and brave voice, she inspires readers to willingly turn our attention toward our false identities and vigilantly defended beliefs in order to better see the truth and vulnerability of our existence. Herein lies the staircase we can climb to enlightenment. --<i>Gail Hudson</i><b>Praise for Karen Armstrong</b><br>&#x201c;Karen Armstrong is a genius.&#x201d; --A. N.

After graduating from the University of Texas with a B.B.A. in Finance, he received his law degree from Vanderbilt University. Shortly after graduating from law school, he was partly paralyzed when struck by a falling tree while jogging. Despite his life-changing accident, he went on to become a justice on the Texas Supreme Court, Texas attorney general, and now governor of Texas. Governor Abbott is an avid sportsman and hunter. He and his wife, Cecilia, have been married for thirty-four years. She is a former schoolteacher and principal and the first Hispanic First Lady of Texas. They live in Austin. Their daughter, Audrey, attends college.<b>Ready to Run</b><br> &nbsp;<br> That afternoon, after several hours of study, I shifted my focus from the thick law books to the treasured plane tickets, smiled, and shouted to Fred, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go jogging!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This interruption was no shock to Fred, who was studying in his room. We often took a running break.<br> &nbsp;<br> A few minutes later, we were out running on well-kept sidewalks that sliced through manicured lawns of an upscale neighborhood, west of downtown Houston.<br> &nbsp;<br> From my days in Little League baseball to high school football, and an undefeated regular season in track, I had always loved to run. The challenge of running, and the physical exertion, always gave me a renewed vigor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whether it was athletics, mowing lawns in the summer, or hauling steel in a forge factory, I&#x2019;d always felt a physical, mental, and emotional renewal from hard work. Believe me, running in the July heat in Houston was hard work.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a typical muggy afternoon, but windy and overcast. Fred and I headed down the sidewalk at a brisk pace. The burden of my studies began to fall off my shoulders with every stride.<br> &nbsp;<br> We usually ran side by side, trading good-natured verbal jabs along the way. But whenever the route wasn&#x2019;t wide enough, I found myself sprinting ahead. About ten minutes into our run, I noticed the sidewalk ahead was about to narrow. I moved in front of Fred.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>One Second</b><br> The first shock was the sound&#x2014;a loud explosion that sounded like a bomb had exploded about ten feet away. Reflexively, I turned my head to the right, where the sound originated. It was a tree. A big oak, well over fifty feet tall, with a trunk two or three feet wide&#x2014;and an enormous crack at the base.<br> &nbsp;<br> And the tree was falling exactly where I was running.<br> &nbsp;<br> Think of the sense of panic you feel when you perceive imminent danger. That sudden sinking feeling in your stomach when your heart abruptly stops, then races rapidly. That moment of fright that makes your hair stand on end. Then multiply it times a hundred. That&#x2019;s what I felt.<br> &nbsp;<br> In a nanosecond, thoughts raced through my head.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>If I stop or keep going straight, I&#x2019;m gonna get clobbered, and I can&#x2019;t go left because cars are parked there. Go right!</i><br> &nbsp;<br> The next thing I knew, I was down. Flat on my back. The entire catastrophe&#x2014;from the time I heard the sound until I hit the ground&#x2014;lasted no more than a second.<br> &nbsp;<br> The good news was that I was still conscious. The bad news was that I had not lost consciousness. The pain was immediate, excruciating, and unrelenting. I had broken bones in the past and had a concussion playing football. But this was altogether different.<br> &nbsp;<br> The pain was magnified by my inability to breathe. I&#x2019;d had the wind knocked out of me before but this was beyond comparison. Trying to take in air ripped me with stabbing pains. Any attempt to exhale was sheer torture. All I could muster were short, shallow gasps.<br> &nbsp;<br> I didn&#x2019;t know what had happened, but I could tell it was bad.</p><h2>On Becoming a Novelist</h2><p>"Answers exactly the questions that a dedicated writing student would be most likely to ask . . . a miraculously detailed account of the creative process."--Anne Tyler, <em>Baltimore Sun</em></p><p>Picture the poor, young, serious-fiction writer. He toils alone at a pace not so different from that of Lincoln Tunnel traffic at rush hour in New York. His spouse has a "real" job, or perhaps he has a trust fund. His college friends are cashing in on their dot-coms and wondering if he's ever going to join the real world. He is not hell-bent on publication; he is trying to write "serious, honest fiction, the kind of novel that readers will find they enjoy reading more than once, the kind of fiction likely to survive." He's likely to have no idea whether he's succeeding. Nobody understands him.<p> Well, almost nobody. John Gardner understands him. Gardner's sympathetic <i>On Becoming a Novelist</i> is the novelist's ultimate comfort food--better than macaroni and cheese, better than chocolate. Gardner, a fiction writer himself (<i>Grendel</i>), knows in his bones the desperate questioning of a writer who's not sure he's up to the task. He recognizes the validation that comes with being published, just as he believes that "for a true novel there is generally no substitute for slow, slow baking." Gardner also has strong feelings about what kinds of workshops help (and whom they help), and what kinds hinder. But a full half of Gardner's book is devoted to an exploration of the writer's nature. The storyteller's intelligence, he says, "is composed of several qualities, most of which, in normal people, are signs of either immaturity or incivility." In addition, a writer needs "verbal sensitivity, accuracy of eye," and "an almost demonic compulsiveness." But wait--there's more. A writer needs to be driven, and to be driven, he says insightfully, "a psychological wound is helpful." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>John Gardner was the best-selling author of more than 25 books and taught creative writing at many universities, among them Chico State, Bennington College, and SUNY-Binghamton. His novels Grendel, The Sunlight Dialogues, and October Light are regarded as modern classics. He was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1982 at the age of 49.</p><h2>Revenge in a Cold River: A William Monk Novel</h2><p><b>Master of mystery and historical intrigue Anne Perry once again transports readers to the banks of the Thames in Victorian London for her thrilling new William Monk novel.

As he reached the top, the November wind struck him with chill, although it was a clear day. Or perhaps it was the figure of the customs officer McNab, waiting for him with one of his subordinates, that made him so aware of the cold.<br><br>How long had they known each other? He had no idea. In the coach accident nearly thirteen years ago, in 1856, his entire life up until then had vanished. He knew of it only through deduction, and other people&#x2019;s memories. He had bluffed it brilliantly. A handful of people closest to him knew. Each one of them, in a sense, held the quality of his life in their hands.<br><br>McNab hated him. Monk did not know why, but he knew very well why he hated McNab. McNab was behind the failure of the gunrunning arrest that had ended in open battle on the deck of the smugglers&#x2019; ship, and Orme&#x2019;s death. He just did not know exactly how McNab was involved well enough to prove it. It was months ago now, but Monk still grieved for Orme, who had been his mentor, right-�hand man, and above all friend, since the day Monk was appointed as commander of the Thames River Police.<br><br>McNab was waiting for him now, a solid man with his feet planted firmly on the dockside, the wind tugging at his heavy coat. He turned as he caught sight of Monk, and his blunt face assumed an expression of anticipation.<br><br>&#x201c;Morning, Mr. Monk,&#x201d; he said loudly enough for his voice to carry above the distant sounds of chains being hauled, the slap of water on the steps, and the shouts of bargees and lightermen out on the tide. &#x201c;Got one for you!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good morning, Mr. McNab,&#x201d; Monk replied, stopping beside him and looking down at the lumpy outline under the canvas tarpaulin in front of him. The message that had brought him here had said that a body had been pulled from the incoming tide.<br><br>Monk lifted the tarpaulin off the corpse. It was a middle-�aged man, fully dressed in well-�worn working clothes. He was very little bloated from the water, and Monk judged he had probably been in it for only a few hours. His face was vacant-�looking, but not disfigured, apart from a couple of bruises and a little swelling. Obviously that had happened before he died. Monk did not need the police surgeon to tell him so. When the heart stops, so does the bleeding, particularly into bruises.<br><br>Monk leaned forward and felt the thick, sodden hair. His fingers moved slowly, searching for an injury, either a lump, or a soft depression where the skull might be broken. He found nothing. He opened one of the eyelids and saw the tiny red spots in the white of the eye that indicated a lack of oxygen.<br><br>Monk looked up at McNab to see if he had noticed the spots, and saw in his face a moment of unguarded satisfaction. McNab smoothed it away instantly and his face became expressionless again.<br><br>Strangled? There were no marks on the throat; the larynx was not broken or crushed. Drowned? It was not uncommon in the Thames. The water was deep, filthy, and ice cold, the current fast and treacherous.<br><br>&#x201c;So why am I here, Mr. McNab?&#x201d; Monk asked. &#x201c;Who is he?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No idea,&#x201d; McNab answered quickly. His voice had a slightly rasping quality. &#x201c;Not yet. Thought you ought to be sent for before we do anything. Wouldn&#x2019;t like to damage the evidence . . .&#x201d; He let the remark hang unfinished. Then he gave a small, satisfied smile. &#x201c;Let you look at him a bit more closely, like.&#x201d;<br><br>Now Monk knew that there was far more to this than he had seen yet. McNab was waiting for him to find it or, better, to have to be shown.<br><br>He took the tarpaulin off the rest of the corpse and let it lie on the stone of the dockside. He looked at the hands and feet. The hands were whole, quite soft, without calluses and with nails clipped short, carefully. Not a manual worker. He felt the upper arms through the cloth of the woolen shirt. No heavy muscles.<br><br>The man&#x2019;s boots were ordinary brown leather, cheap but serviceable. No tears in his trousers. His coat seemed to be missing, or perhaps he had not been wearing one at the time he fell into the water.<br><br>McNab was still smiling, very slightly, and watching. It brought back to Monk some long-�ago memory of buzzards sitting on high fence posts watching for small vermin in the grass.<br><br>What had Monk missed? A drowned man with soft hands . . . With difficulty, and no help from McNab or his colleague, he turned the man over, laying him on his face. Then he saw it: the neat bullet hole through the back. If there had been any blood or powder burns the river had washed them away.<br><br>Had he been wounded before he went into the water, perhaps fatally? No, because those tiny red blood dots in his eyes said he had struggled for breath. Had he been almost suffocated, escaped, and been shot after, when he was close to the water, or already in it?<br><br>Monk looked back up at McNab. &#x201c;Interesting,&#x201d; he said with a nod of agreement. &#x201c;Better find out who he is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; McNab agreed. &#x201c;Not an accident, then, eh? Murder&#x2019;s your job. I&#x2019;d help you if I could, of course. Cooperation, right? But I&#x2019;ve no idea.&#x201d; He gave a very slight shrug. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all yours.&#x201d; He turned and walked away.<br><br>Hooper had secured the boat in which he and Monk had come, and he stood near the edge of the dock, waiting until McNab was gone. Now he came forward, his gaze still on the retreating figures until they disappeared round the side of the warehouse and he and Monk were alone on the quay. There was noise all around them of men unloading in the nearby docks. They shouted to one another. Mooring chains clanked. There were thumps and the creak of bales landing, the sharper sound of wooden kegs hitting the stone, and from below them the slurp of water.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t trust that bastard as far as I could throw him,&#x201d; Hooper said. Then he looked down at the corpse.<br><br>Hooper had taken over as Monk&#x2019;s right-�hand man since Orme&#x2019;s death. He was in many ways a contrast. Orme had been white-�haired, quiet, a compact man always in a pea coat except in the middle of summer. Good-�natured, softly spoken, he had known the river better than most men knew their own backyards. He was devoted to his daughter and new grandchild, and had been just about to retire to a house on the riverbank. He meant to spend his last years with them, talking to old friends, sharing a few pints of ale, and watching the wild birds fly over toward the Estuary.<br><br>Hooper was tall and loose-�limbed, almost gangling, and naturally untidy. He was probably at least thirty years younger than Orme. He too was quiet, most of the time, but he had a quick sense of humor. Orme had protected Monk, knowing his ignorance of the river to begin with, and his need to learn; Hooper was also loyal in a fight&#x2014;�loyal to the death&#x2014;�but he was not uncritical, as Monk had recently learned.<br><br>Now Hooper looked at the corpse&#x2019;s hands, turning them over and examining them, especially the fingers. As he did so, Monk noticed a slight stain so deep into the layers of the skin that the water had not removed it.<br><br>&#x201c;Ink?&#x201d; he said curiously.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, he&#x2019;s not a manual worker,&#x201d; Hooper responded. &#x201c;And from his clothes he doesn&#x2019;t look like a clerk or a shopkeeper.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d better find whoever pulled him from the water.&#x201d; Monk turned and stared up and down the broad river, crowded with boats. Nearest them were four-� and five-�masted schooners, riding at anchor, sails furled, waiting to unload their cargoes. A string of barges moved slowly upstream. Ferries wove their way across from bank to bank.<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose McNab didn&#x2019;t bother to tell us that,&#x201d; Hooper said darkly. He spoke of it rarely, but he too held McNab responsible for the gunfight and therefore for Orme&#x2019;s death. He had not given up hope that one day they would be able to prove it. He did not want private vengeance any more than Monk did, but he did want justice. Orme had been not only a good man; he had been in the River Police almost all his adult life. There was a loyalty to be kept, for the sake of the future as well as the past.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Monk said wryly. &#x201c;But he sent for the police surgeon, at least. That looks like him coming along the dockside now.&#x201d; He inclined his head in a slight gesture toward the figure approaching. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll talk to him. Go and see what you can find out from the watermen along at the next steps.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Hooper set off, walking surprisingly fast. He had caught up with a group of stevedores and lightermen before Monk greeted the police surgeon.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;ve you got?&#x201d; the surgeon asked, regarding the corpse without interest. He was a man in his sixties named Hyde, stocky in build with fair hair thinning at the front, and a keen face. Monk had worked with him several times before and liked his dark sense of humor.<br><br>&#x201c;A man with soft hands, suffocated and shot in the back,&#x201d; Monk replied with a twisted smile.<br><br>Hyde stared at him with very slightly raised eyebrows. He nodded slowly. &#x201c;In a nutshell,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Know who he is?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No idea. He was fished out of the water when he came up with the flood tide. If any of the watermen knew, they&#x2019;re not saying. Hooper&#x2019;s gone to see if he can find someone prepared to be a bit more exact.&#x201d;<br><br>Hyde kneeled down beside the body and examined it gently and very carefully. He looked at the head, the neck, the hands and feet, the wrists, then turned him over to see the wound in his back, exactly as Monk had.<br><br>&#x201c;It was McNab from Customs who called me,&#x201d; Hyde said at last, straightening his knees to stand up and giving a little wince as his arthritis reminded him to be more careful. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose he told you anything useful, Mr. Monk?&#x201d;<br><br>So Hyde knew of the dislike between himself and McNab.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe he didn&#x2019;t know anything,&#x201d; Monk replied noncommittally.<br><br>Hyde gave him a sharp, knowing look. &#x201c;Maybe. And maybe we&#x2019;ll get three tides today instead of two.&#x201d;<br><br>Evidently Hyde didn&#x2019;t like McNab, either.<br><br>&#x201c;One thing,&#x201d; Hyde went on. &#x201c;Customs doesn&#x2019;t know him, or McNab wouldn&#x2019;t have called you. And he&#x2019;s not a waterman or he wouldn&#x2019;t have hands like an artist. But I&#x2019;d stake a bottle of the best single-�malt whisky that whatever his art is, it&#x2019;s illegal.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Was he shot first, or after he went into the water?&#x201d; Monk asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No idea. I&#x2019;ll tell you what I&#x2019;ve found, after I&#x2019;ve found it,&#x201d; Hyde replied cheerfully. He walked over to the top of the steps and signaled for his men to come up and bring the stretcher on which to carry the body. The morgue was on the other side of the river, and by boat was the easiest way to reach it.<br><br>Monk waited until they were gone, and then went after Hooper to see what he had learned. The wind was rising and he felt colder.<br><br>It took them several hours to glean all they could, but it was not a complicated story. A lighterman moving out of his moorings early and making his way upriver had found the body tangled in a mass of rope and rotten wood wreckage near one of the many flights of steps going up from the water to the dockside. The steps were used for loading occasionally. Very often, the many ferries crossing from one bank to the other picked up fares there, or dropped them off.<br><br>The lighterman had waited for the next ferry, which arrived in a matter of a few minutes. Not able to leave his string of barges, he had told the man to call the authorities. In this case they turned out to be a couple of customs men checking an early load coming off a schooner moored nearby. At this time of the year, no daylight was to be wasted. McNab had been sent for, as someone of sufficient rank to deal with the matter.<br><br>Further inquiry turned up no one who knew the corpse. Apparently he was not a bargee, a ferryman, or a docker of any other sort. None of this information surprised Monk. He had deduced that much from the man&#x2019;s appearance.<br><br>He and Hooper were both back at their headquarters in the Wapping Police Station, when at about half past four, almost dusk, they received news that a boat had been reported stolen earlier from the south bank, a mile or two farther down. According to the local police, it was a small rowboat, easily managed by one man. They were linking this to another incident: A prisoner from Plaistow Reformatory had escaped custody while being questioned by customs officers. He was a master forger by the name of Blount, and he answered perfectly the description of the dead man.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes?&#x201d; Hooper said sarcastically. &#x201c;And McNab didn&#x2019;t know of that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I imagine that&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;ll say,&#x201d; Monk replied. &#x201c;Got away yesterday, they said.&#x201d;<br><br>Hooper turned toward him, but his expression was near invisible with his back to the gas lamp. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t believe McNab if he told me what day it was today, never mind yesterday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go to the prison in the morning, see what I can learn about this Blount,&#x201d; Monk said.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you want me to talk to the customs men that allowed him to escape?&#x201d; Hooper offered.<br><br>Monk considered for a very brief moment. &#x201c;No. I&#x2019;ll do that. Easier once I know something about the man. I wonder who shot him. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Hooper grunted, and made no reply.<br><br>Over a hot cup of tea, laced with a spoonful of whisky, Monk wrote up his notes on the day&#x2019;s work, not only the account of the corpse found by McNab&#x2019;s men, but some small thefts and one case of smuggling. It was the part of the job he liked least, but he had learned that the longer he left it, the harder it was to recall details that might matter later on. Sloppy notes and illegible handwriting had ruined more than one case.</p><h2>I Know What You Did Last Summer</h2><p>It was only an accident -- but it would change their lives forever.

"Lobotomy Bob" told Parkin that, to become a pro, he must go to Belgium. Riding along a canal in Belgium years later, Roll encountered Parkin, who he described as "a wraith, an avenging angel of misery,&nbsp;a twelve-toothed assassin". Roll barely recognized him. Belgium had forged Parkin into a pro, and changed him forever.

Of course, we all coughed up blood for the entire trip to France, but it was strangely worth it, as if we had smashed our guitars, poured beer on the audience, and walked offstage before the end of the first song." </p><p>Joe Parkin's life changed when he left America to become a professional bike racer in Belgium. In this brutally frank memoir, Parkin celebrates the glory of racing but doesn't flinch from the cold reality of that life--the drugs, the payoffs, the betrayals by teammates, the battles with team owners for contracts and money, the endless promises, and the sheer physical pain of racing day after day. </p><p>Set in the hardest place in the world to be a bike racer, <i>A Dog in a Hat</i> is one rider's story of his love affair with professional cycling. </p><b>Joe Parkin</b> was an amateur bike racer in California when he met Bob Roll (<i>Bobke II</i>), who advised him to move to Belgium to further his cycling career.

Happily, that oversight has now been rectified, and with this book people everywhere, whether or not they have ever dined at '21,' will be able to bring a bit of its fabled glamour, and much of its justifiably renowned cuisine, into their own homes.<br><br>Michael Lomonaco, the executive chef, is a celebrity in his own right. Having garnered rave reviews from such hard-to-please critics as Gael Greene (<i>New York</i> magazine), John Mariani (<i>Travel &amp; Leisure</i>), and Andy Birsh (<i>Gourmet</i>), he has appeared with Julia Child in her "Master Chefs" series, on both David Letterman shows, and on "Today" with Katie Couric.<br><br><i>The '21' Cookbook</i> contains well over 150 recipes for dishes ranging from the world-famous '21' Burger and Traditional Crab Cakes to many of Michael Lomonaco's innovative ways with grains, fish, and the game for which '21' has always been renowned. And liberally sprinkled throughout are fascinating stories about the restaurant's history, the legends that have grown up around it, and, of course, the many celebrities who have dined there over the years--all illustrated with photographs, cartoons, drawings, and other '21' memorabilia. In short, simply reading <i>The '21' Cookbook</i> is to partake of a feast nearly as opulent as a visit to '21' itself.</p><p>"Michael Lomonaco has combined his classic training with an infectious enthusiasm and a relentless passion for his metier. True knowledge and unmitigated imagination equal greatness in the kitchen."<br>--Jacques Pepin<p>"Can it truly be that a New York institution-to-the-powerful actually serves exciting food and warm hospitality?

Estimates of the number of illegal drinking establishments that sprang up in New York City alone was as high as 32,000--more than twice the number of legal pre-Prohibition drinking places.<br><br>Overnight fortunes were made by catering to this insatiable thirst, a fact not lost on cousins Jack Kriendler and Charlie Berns, two collegians who were struggling to make ends meet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their first speakeasy, The Red Head, sold dollar flasks that customers hid in their coat pockets or poured into teacups, the source of the speakeasy nickname "cup joint." But the atmosphere at Jack and Charlie's had little in common with either a tearoom or the average gin mill. Instead, it felt like one big fraternity party, with live music, gay blades, and liberated flappers doing the Black Bottom and Charleston.<br><br>The clubby feeling at each of the "speaks" Jack and Charlie ran before finding their permanent home at 21 West 52nd Street was no fluke.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack made a conscious effort to "recruit" customers from the Ivy League colleges and to create an environment where the sons of America's first families would feel at home.<br><br>Prices were stratospheric right from the start.&nbsp;&nbsp;But customers got full measure for what they paid.&nbsp;&nbsp;No rotgut hootch.&nbsp;&nbsp;No bathtub gin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack and Charlie went directly to Europe and made arrangements to have the likes of Ballantine's Scotch and Hine Cognac smuggled in.&nbsp;&nbsp;They even hired Kaiser Wilhelm's former chef to run the kitchen.<br><br>It wasn't only undergraduates who rose to the bait.&nbsp;&nbsp;Writers, artists, movie stars, and adventurers quickly staked claim to the red-and-white-check-clothed tables in Jack and Charlie's barroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Ruark, Frank Buck, John Steinbeck, and Ernest Hemingway swapped tales about the ones that got away.

Heat the vegetable oil in a deep-fryer to at least 240deg. but no more than 260deg..&nbsp;&nbsp;(For successful french fries, I strongly recommend using a thermostatically controlled electric deep-fat fryer rather than attempting stovetop frying.) Add to the hot oil a handful of potatoes at a time, so that you don't decrease the temperature of the oil dramatically or crowd the pot. Cook approximately 3 to 4 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove and shake off excess oil.&nbsp;&nbsp;Place on paper towels to drain.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the blanched potatoes are ready for their final frying, or they can be cooled and refrigerated several hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the final frying, increase the heat of the fryer to 350deg. to 360deg., add the blanched potatoes a handful at a time, and deep-fry until golden brown and crisp.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove to paper towels to drain, and salt lightly while still hot. Serve immediately.<br><i>Chef's Tip</i>: The key to avoiding soggy fries is to fry them twice, first at 240deg., then at 360deg..</p><h2>House As a Mirror of Self: Exploring the Deeper Meaning of Home</h2><p>The development of the idea of the home delves into issues such as privacy, domesticity, efficiency, and analyzes the social and cultural factors that shaped them</p><p>This is a refreshing, unique, and fascinating look at how we feel about our homes, how we shape them to suit ourselves, why some homes make is feel safe and secure and at ease, and others make us paranoid and uncomfortable.

It was not actually on the top floor, it was <i>above</i> the top floor, reached by a narrow wooden staircase, the kind the wives of New Bedford whalers climbed to prowl the balconies, hoping&#x2014;most of the time&#x2014;for familiar ships that signaled the return of their own particular Ahabs from the angry ocean.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In summer months the office was suffocating, as there was only one small window. During the winter it was freezing, as its wooden shell had no insulation and the window rattled incessantly, impervious to caulking, permitting the cold winds to whip inside as though invited. In essence, this room, this antiquated upper chamber with its sparse furniture purchased around the turn of the century, was the Siberia of the government agency in which it was housed. The last formal employee who toiled there was a discredited American Indian who had the temerity to learn to read English and suggested to his superiors, who themselves could barely read English, that certain restrictions placed on a reservation of the Navajo nation were too severe. It is said the man died in that upper office in the cold January of 1927 and was not discovered until the following May, when the weather was warm and the air suddenly scented. The government agency was, of course, the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the current occupant, however, the foregoing was not a deterrent but rather an incentive. The lone figure in the nondescript gray suit huddled over the rolltop desk, which wasn&#x2019;t much of a desk, as all its little drawers had been removed and the rolling top was stuck at half-mast, was General Mac�Ken�zie Hawkins, military legend, hero in three wars and twice winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor. This giant of a man, his lean muscular figure belying his elderly years, his steely eyes and tanned leather-lined face perhaps confirming a number of them, had once again gone into combat. However, for the first time in his life, he was not at war with the enemies of his beloved United States of America but with the government of the United States itself. Over something that took place a hundred and twelve years ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t much matter when, he thought, as he squeaked around in his ancient swivel chair and propelled himself to an adjacent table piled high with old leather-bound ledgers and maps. They were the <i>same</i> pricky-shits who had screwed <i>him,</i> stripped him of his uniform, and put him out to military pasture! They were all the goddamned same, whether in their frilly frock coats of a hundred years ago or their piss-elegant, tight-assed pinstripes of today. They were <i>all</i> pricky-shits. Time did not matter, nailing them did!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The general pulled down the chain of a green-shaded, goosenecked lamp&#x2014;circa early twenties&#x2014;and studied a map, in his right hand a large magnifying glass. He then spun around to his dilapidated desk and reread the paragraph he had underlined in the ledger whose binding had split with age. His perpetually squinting eyes suddenly were wide and bright with excitement. He reached for the only instrument of communication he had at his disposal, since the installation of a telephone might reveal his more than scholarly presence at the Bureau. It was a small cone attached to a tube; he blew into it twice, the signal of emergency. He waited for a reply; it came over the primitive instrument thirty-eight seconds later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Mac?&#x201d;</i> said the rasping voice over the antediluvian connection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Heseltine, I&#x2019;ve <i>got</i> it!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;For Christ&#x2019;s sake, blow into this thing a little easier, will you?

Then:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let you in, Mac, but then I fade until you tell me I&#x2019;ve got my uniform back.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Fair enough. Incidentally, I&#x2019;m packing everything I&#x2019;ve got here and taking it back to my place in Arlington.

In the seventh aisle, Mac�Ken�zie Hawkins stopped, his beam on an ancient volume whose leather binding was cracked. &#x201c;I think this is it, Heseltine.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Good, and you can&#x2019;t take it out of here!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I understand that, General, so I&#x2019;ll merely take a few photographs and return it.&#x201d; Hawkins removed a tiny spy camera with 110 film from his gray suit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How many rolls have you got?&#x201d; asked former General Heseltine Broke�michael as Mac�Ken�zie carried the huge book to a steel table at the end of the aisle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Eight,&#x201d; replied Hawkins, opening the yellow-paged volume to the pages he needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I have a couple of others, if you need them,&#x201d; said Heseltine. &#x201c;Not that I&#x2019;m so all fired-up by what you think you may have found, but if there&#x2019;s any way to get back at Ethelred, I&#x2019;ll <i>take</i> it!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought you two had made up,&#x201d; broke in Mac�Ken�zie, while turning pages and snapping pictures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Never!&#x201d;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t Ethelred&#x2019;s fault, it was that rotten lawyer in the Inspector General&#x2019;s office, a half-assed kid from Harvard named Devereaux, Sam Devereaux.

Brokey, I need the volume next to or near this one. It should say CXII on the binding. Get it for me, will you?&#x201d; As the head of Indian Affairs walked back into the metal stacks, the Hawk took a single-edged razor out of his pocket and sliced out fifteen successive pages of the archival ledger. Without folding the precious papers, he slipped them under his suit coat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t find it,&#x201d; said Broke�michael.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Never mind, I&#x2019;ve got what I need.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What now, Mac?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A long time, Heseltine, maybe a long, long time, perhaps a year or so, but I&#x2019;ve got to make it right&#x2014;so right there&#x2019;s no holes, no holes at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;In what?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;In a suit I&#x2019;m going to file against the government of the United States,&#x201d; replied Hawkins, pulling a mutilated cigar out of his pocket and lighting it with a World War&nbsp;II Zippo. &#x201c;You wait, Brokey-One, and you watch.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Good <i>God,</i> for <i>what</i>? . . .

It&#x2019;s not <i>in</i> the books, Heseltine, not the ones you can read. It&#x2019;s in your stomach, in your gut. Some things are right and some things are wrong, it&#x2019;s as simple as that.

I&#x2019;ve got to do it right. Real right.&#x201d; General Mac�Ken�zie Hawkins strode out between the metal racks of the archives to the exit. <i>&#x201c;Goddamn,&#x201d;</i> he said to himself. &#x201c;Now I really go to work. Get <i>ready</i> for me, you magnificent Wopotamis. I&#x2019;m <i>yours</i>!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Twenty-one months passed, and <i>nobody</i> was ready for Thunder Head, chief of the Wopotamis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The President of the United States, his jaw firm, his angry eyes steady and penetrating, accelerated his pace along the steel-gray corridor in the underground complex of the White House. In seconds, he had outdistanced his entourage, his tall, lean frame angled forward as if bucking a torrential wind, an impatient figure wanting only to reach the storm-tossed battlements and survey the bloody costs of war so as to devise a strategy and repel the invading hordes assaulting his realm. He was John of Arc, his racing mind building a counterattack at Orleans, a Harry Five who knew the decisive Agincourt was in the immediate picture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the moment, however, his immediate objective was the anxiety-prone Situation Room, buried in the lowest levels of the White House. He reached a door, yanked it open, and strode inside as his subordinates, now trotting and breathless, followed in unison.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>All</i> right, fellas!&#x201d; he roared. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s <i>skull</i>!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A brief silence ensued, broken by the tremulous, high- pitched voice of a female aide. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think in here, Mr.&nbsp;President.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What? <i>Why?</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This is the men&#x2019;s room, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh? . . .

Let&#x2019;s go. <i>Out!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The large round table in the Situation Room glistened under the wash of the indirect lighting, reflecting the shadows of the bodies seated around it. These blocks of shadow on the polished wood, like the bodies themselves, remained immobile as the stunned faces attached to those bodies stared in astonishment at the gaunt, bespectacled man who stood behind the President in front of a portable blackboard, on which he had drawn numerous diagrams in four different colors of chalk. The visual aids were somewhat less than effective as two of the crisis management team were color-blind. The bewildered expression on the youthful Vice-President&#x2019;s face was nothing new and therefore dismissible, but the growing agitation on the part of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was not so easily dismissed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Goddamn</i> it, Washbum, I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Washburn, General.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s nice.

I would have given <i>anything</i> to correct the problem!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Close it up, gumball,&#x201d; said the swarthy-skinned director of the Central Intelligence Agency, his voice low but his half-lidded, dark eyes ominous. &#x201c;The friggin&#x2019; campaign&#x2019;s over.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Now, really, Vincent, there&#x2019;s no cause for that language,&#x201d; intruded the President. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lady present.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That judgment&#x2019;s up for grabs, Prez. The lady in question is not unfamiliar with the lingua franca, as it were.&#x201d; The DCI smiled grimly at the glaring female aide and returned to the man named Washburn at the portable blackboard. &#x201c;You, our legal expert here, what kind of&nbsp;. . . creek are we up?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>That&#x2019;s</i> better, Vinnie,&#x201d; added the President. &#x201c;I appreciate it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome. . . .

And do me a favor, don&#x2019;t spend a week getting there, okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;As you wish, Mr.&nbsp;Mangecavallo,&#x201d; said the White House attorney, placing the colored chalk on the blackboard ledge. &#x201c;I was merely trying to diagram the historical precedents relative to the altered laws where the Indian nations were concerned.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What <i>nations</i>?&#x201d; asked the Vice-President, in his voice a trace of arrogance. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re tribes, not countries.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>&lt;...</p><h2>American Civil War</h2><p>Retells the story of the conflict from the attack at Fort Sumter to the surrender at Appomattox</p><p>5 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Lying On The Couch: A Novel</h2><p>Frustrated by the challenges of his psychiatric practice, Ernest Lash is compelled to create a remarkable new approach to therapy that involves a completely open, authentic relationship with his clients. $50,000 ad/promo.

By 1975 he was brought in as a staff photographer for the magazine Skateboard World. During the next five years he documented the meteoric rise of the movement, capturing thousands of photographs along the way. Back in the Day features hundreds of Sharps astounding photos from this era, the vast majority of which have never been seen before. The work is priceless, not only for its documentary value, but for the beautiful and poetic images captured and later developed by Sharp himself (many in black and white). Pipes in Arizona, aqueducts in California, pools all over the place, the locales and images must be seen to be believed. More recently, Ozzie Ausband signed on as an editor of the project, collecting present day quotes and assisting with the paring down of Sharps massive photo archive. Sharps epic photos are populated by the vanguard of the scene such as Tony Alva, Jay Adams, Jerry Valdez, Steve Caballero, and Jay Smith, among many others. <p> Ozzie Ausband lives in Los Angeles and runs a popular blog about pool skating and its history.

Recognizing photos of her mother and grandmother in the book, she discovers a horrifying fact: Her grandfather was Amon Goeth, the vicious Nazi commandant chillingly depicted by Ralph Fiennes in <i>Schindler&#x2019;s List</i>&#x2014;a man known and reviled the world over.<br><br> Although raised in an orphanage and eventually adopted, Teege had some contact with her biological mother and grandmother as a child. Yet neither revealed that Teege&#x2019;s grandfather was the Nazi &#x201c;butcher of Plasz�w,&#x201d; executed for crimes against humanity in 1946. The more Teege reads about Amon Goeth, the more certain she becomes: If her grandfather had met her&#x2014;a black woman&#x2014;he would have killed her.<br><br> Teege&#x2019;s discovery sends her, at age 38, into a severe depression&#x2014;and on a quest to unearth and fully comprehend her family&#x2019;s haunted history. Her research takes her to Krakow&#x2014;to the sites of the Jewish ghetto her grandfather &#x201c;cleared&#x201d; in 1943 and the Plasz�w concentration camp he then commanded&#x2014;and back to Israel, where she herself once attended college, learned fluent Hebrew, and formed lasting friendships. Teege struggles to reconnect with her estranged mother Monika, and to accept that her beloved grandmother once lived in luxury as Amon Goeth&#x2019;s mistress at Plasz�w.<br><br> Teege&#x2019;s story is cowritten by award-winning journalist Nikola Sellmair, who also contributes a second, interwoven narrative that draws on original interviews with Teege&#x2019;s family and friends and adds historical context. Ultimately, Teege&#x2019;s resolute search for the truth leads her, step by step, to the possibility of her own liberation.</p><p><b>Jennifer Teege</b>&nbsp;worked in advertising for 16 years before becoming an author.

Following a six-year stint as a Fulbright Scholar and military translator in Germany, he returned to New York in the sixties to more than a decade as a successful magazine article writer. These easy-going editorial years -- in a better literary America -- were punctuated by the 1968 publication of Hersh's first novel, "The Ski People" (McGraw Hill). <p>Hersh's persistent interest in contemporary American history led to the 1973 appearance of "The Education of Edward Kennedy" (Morrow), which quickly established itself as the standard work on the embattled liberal senator. "The Shadow President" (Steerforth Press) appeared in 1997, a universally acclaimed follow-up volume about Kennedy's later career. Also offered by Morrow, "The Mellon Family," came out in 1978, was a Book-of-the-Month-Club selection and, like "The Education," wound up among the top fifty books in sales in the year it came out.</p>A sprawling chronicle that details how a clutch of Ivy- educated Wall Street attorneys and their associates--the ``Old Boy network''--created the Central Intelligence Agency and influenced the formative decades of the cold war. Hersh (The Mellon Family, 1978, etc.) has performed a prodigious job of research, conducting more than 100 interviews and burrowing through mounds of archives and declassified documents. His narrative runs from the 1919 Versailles conference, where the young Dulles brothers observed uncle Robert Lansing, Woodrow Wilson's secretary of state, to the Bay of Pigs operation and the frustrating retirement years of its principals. Six men occupy the foreground here: sanctimonious John Foster Dulles and his hedonistic younger brother Allen, who before their heyday as Eisenhower cold warriors were well-heeled corporate lawyers who ran interference for German firms instrumental in the Nazis' prewar rearmament; legendary OSS chief ``Wild Bill'' Donovan; Frank Wisner, ultimately CIA operations chief; New Deal diplomat William C. Bullitt; and Carmel Offie, the dandyish assistant to Bullitt and Wisner and a master of diplomatic sleight-of-hand. Hersh hopes to show how these latter-day Wilsonian ``global salvationists,'' aching to roll back the Communist menace, forged an intelligence apparatus intoxicated with the black arts of covert activities- -loosely supervised, often amateurish, sometimes harebrained. He sheds light on the frantic wartime operations of Allen Dulles and Wisner in Europe, as well as on how much the Americans benefited from the bulging Soviet files of ex-Nazi intelligence chief Reinhard Gehlen. Yet time and again, Hersh projects his insouciance until it begins to grate (e.g., George Kennan was a ``brilliant, mavericky, neurasthenic cheese-parer''). Dulles &amp; Co. deserve a more straightforward treatment than this arch account that bites off more than it can chew.

At the top of his class at Princeton, he is snapped up by an elite valuation firm. He thrives on the energy of New York, and his budding romance with elegant, beautiful Erica promises entry into Manhattan society at the same exalted level once occupied by his own family back in Lahore.&nbsp;But in the wake of September 11, Changez finds his position in his adopted city suddenly overturned, and his relationship with Erica shifting. And Changez&#x2019;s own identity is in seismic shift as well, unearthing allegiances more fundamental than money, power, and maybe even love.<br><br> &nbsp;</p></p><p>Mohsin Hamid's first novel, <i>Moth Smoke</i>, dealt with the confluence of personal and political themes, and his second, <i>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</i>, revisits that territory in the person of Changez, a young Pakistani. Told in a single monologue, the narrative never flags. Changez is by turns naive, sinister, unctuous, mildly threatening, overbearing, insulting, angry, resentful, and sad. He tells his story to a nameless, mysterious American who sits across from him at a Lahore cafe. Educated at Princeton, employed by a first-rate valuation firm, Changez was living the American dream, earning more money than he thought possible, caught up in the New York social scene and in love with a beautiful, wealthy, damaged girl. The romance is negligible; Erica is emotionally unavailable, endlessly grieving the death of her lifelong friend and boyfriend, Chris. <p> Changez is in Manila on 9/11 and sees the towers come down on TV. He tells the American, "...I <i>smiled</i>. Yes, despicable as it may sound, my initial reaction was to be remarkably pleased... I was caught up in the symbolism of it all, the fact that someone had so visibly brought America to her knees..." When he returns to New York, there is a palpable change in attitudes toward him, starting right at immigration. His name and his face render him suspect. </p><p> Ongoing trouble between Pakistan and India urge Changez to return home for a visit, despite his parents' advice to stay where he is. While there, he realizes that he has changed in a way that shames him. "I was struck at first by how shabby our house appeared... I was saddened to find it in such a state... This was where I came from... and it smacked of lowliness." He exorcises that feeling and once again appreciates his home for its "unmistakable personality and idiosyncratic charm." While at home, he lets his beard grow. Advised to shave it, even by his mother, he refuses. It will be his line in the sand, his statement about who he is. His company sends him to Chile for another business valuation; his mind filled with the troubles in Pakistan and the U.S. involvement with India that keeps the pressure on. His work and the money he earns have been overtaken by resentment of the United States and all it stands for. </p><p> Hamid's prose is filled with insight, subtly delivered: "I felt my age: an almost childlike twenty-two, rather than that permanent middle-age that attaches itself to the man who lives alone and supports himself by wearing a suit in a city not of his birth." In telling of the janissaries, Christian boys captured by Ottomans and trained to be soldiers in the Muslim Army, his Chilean host tells him: "The janissaries were always taken in childhood. It would have been far more difficult to devote themselves to their adopted empire, you see, if they had memories they could not forget." Changez cannot forget, and Hamid makes the reader understand that--and all that follows. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i> </p><p> </p> <br><b>A Conversation with Mohsin Hamid </b><br>Set in modern-day Pakistan, Mohsin Hamid's debut novel, <i>Moth Smoke</i>, went on to win awards and was listed as a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year.

A native of Oklahoma, Tony Hillerman lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, until his death in 2008.</p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p>At first, Officer Jim Chee had felt foolish sitting on the roof of the house of some total stranger. But that uneasiness had soon faded. Now this vantage point on the roof had come to seem one of Cowboy Dashee's rare good ideas. Chee could see almost everywhere from here. The drummers directly beneath the tips of his freshly shined boots, the column of masked dancers just entering the plaza to his left, the crowd of spectators jammed along the walls of the buildings, the sales booths lining the narrow streets beyond, he looked down on all of it. And out over the flat crowded roofs of Tano Pueblo, he could rest his eyes on the ragged row of cottonwoods along the river, golden today with autumn, or upon the blue mountains blocking the horizon, or the greentan-silver patchwork of farm fields the Tanoans irrigated. </p><p>It was an excellent perch from which to witness the Tanoan kachina dance--for duty as well as pleasure. Especially with the warm, jeans-clad thigh of Janet Pete pressed against him. If Delmar Kanitewa was present, Chee would be likely to see him. If the boy didn't show up, then there was no better place from which to watch the ceremonial. Such mystical rituals had always fascinated Chee. Since boyhood Chee had wanted to follow Hosteen Frank Sam Nakai. In the Navajo family structure Nakai was Chee's "Little Father," his mother's elder brother. Nakai was a shaman of the highest order. He was a <i>hataalii</i>--what the whites called a singer, or medicine man. He was respected for his knowledge of the traditional religion and of the curing ways the Holy People had taught to keep humankind in harmony with the reality that surrounds us all. Nakai worked along that narrow line that separates flesh and spirit. Since boyhood, that had interested Chee. </p><p>"On the roof is where they like visitors to sit when they're having a kachina dance," Dashee had said. "It gets you tourists out from underfoot. Unless you fall off, there's a lot less chance you'll do something stupid and mess up </p><p>the ceremony. And it leaves room around the dance ground for the Tano people. They need to exchange gifts with the kachinas. Things like that." </p><p>Dashee was a sworn deputy sheriff of Apache County, Arizona, a Hopi of his people's ancient Side Corn Clan, and Jim Chee's closest friend. But he could also be a pain in the butt. </p><p>"But what if I spot the kid?" Chee had asked. "Is he going to wait while I climb down?" </p><p>"Why not? He won't know you're looking for him." Cowboy had then leaned against Janet Pete and confided in a stage whisper, "The boy'll think Detective Chee would be over there in Thoreau working on that big homicide. " </p><p>"You know," Asher Davis said, "I'll bet I know that guy. There was a teacher at that Saint Bonaventure School--one of those volunteers--who called me a time or two to see if I could get a good price for something some old-timer had to sell. One time it was a little silver pollen container--looked late nineteenth century--and some jerk in Farmington had offered this old man two dollars for it. I got him two hundred and fifty. I wonder if that was the teacher who got killed." </p><p>"His name was Dorsey," Chee said, sounding slightly grouchy. He didn't know Davis and wasn't sure he'd like him. But maybe that was just the mood he was in. </p><p>"Dorsey," Davis said. "That's him." </p><p>"See?" Cowboy said. "Officer Chee keeps up on those serious crimes. And he also has time to write letters to the editor telling the Tano council what to do with its old uranium mines." </p><p>Chee had been ignoring Dashee's needling all morning. At first it had been based on the letter, published in that morning's edition of the <i>Navajo Times.</i> In it, Chee had opposed a proposal to use the open pit of the abandoned Jacks Wild Mine as a toxic waste dump. He had called it "symbolic of the contempt felt for tribal lands." But then they had heard of the homicide on the car radio. A school shop teacher at Thoreau had been hit fatally on the head. Some materials were reported missing and no suspect had been identified. It was a pretty good murder by reservation standards. Certainly it was more dignified than this assignment. It had happened yesterday, on Chee's day off. Still, Lieutenant Leaphorn might have assigned him to work on it. Or at least mentioned it. But he hadn't, and that burned a little. </p><p>What burned more was Janet. Janet had encouraged Cowboy's needling with amused grins and occasional chuckles. </p><p>But now, warmed by her praise of his letter, Chee was willing to forgive all that--even to feel better about Cowboy. He had to concede that he had started the exchange by kidding Cowboy about the Hopi tendency to grow wide, instead of high. And he had to concede that what Cowboy had said about the roof was true enough. If Kanitewa was down there In the crowd watching his pueblo celebrate this autumn feast day, the boy would be feeling secure among family and friends. But, on the other hand, kids who run away from boarding school know someone will be coming after them. </p><p>Chee had been just such a kid himself, once. That feeling of fear, of being hunted, was one he could never forget. You can't relax even when, as in Chee's case, the hunt was brief and there was little time for the fear to build. The man from the boarding school had been parked out of sight behind the sheep pens, waiting, when Chee had walked up to his mother's hogan. Seeing him had been almost a relief.</p></p><h2>Guns of August</h2><p>the greatest tale of the beginning of World War I</p><p>To many people, W.W.I seems like ancient history. To me, it is the most fascinating of wars. It is when the modern world began, or, in Barbara Tuchman's opinion, when the 19th Century ended. My late Great Uncle Jimmy, a Brit, joined the Army at the age of 16 by lying that he was 18 after being encouraged to do so by a recruiter. Where did they send him? To Ireland, to train horses for the cavalry! This was the same war that saw the debut of the airplane, submarine, tank, poison gas, machine gun, flamethrower, and hand grenade!<br><br>In this Pulitzer Prize-winning history, Tuchman writes about the turning point of the year 1914--the month leading up to the war and the first month of the war. This was the last gasp of the Gilded Age, of Kings and Kaisers and Czars, of pointed or plumed hats, colored uniforms, and all the pomp and romance that went along with war. How quickly it all changed, and how horrible it became. Tuchman is masterful at portraying this abrupt change from 19th to 20th Century. And how she manages to make the story utterly suspenseful, when we already know the outcome, is the mark of a great writer, and a classic volume of history.<br><br>Doug Grad, Editor"More dramtatic than fiction...THE GUNS OF AUGUST is a magnificent narrative--beautifully organized, elegantly phrased, skillfully paced and sustained....The product of painstaking and sophisticated research."<br>CHICAGO TRIBUNE<br>Historian and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Barbara Tuchman has brought to life again the people and events that led up to Worl War I. With attention to fascinating detail, and an intense knowledge of her subject and its characters, Ms. Tuchman reveals, for the first time, just how the war started, why, and why it could have been stopped but wasn't. A classic historical survey of a time and a people we all need to know more about, THE GUNS OF AUGUST will not be forgotten.</p><h2>The Givers: Wealth, Power, and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age</h2><p><b>An inside look at the secretive world of elite philanthropists--and how they're quietly wielding ever more power to shape American life in ways both good and bad.</b> <br><br>While media attention focuses on famous philanthropists such as Bill Gates and Charles Koch, thousands of donors are at work below the radar promoting a wide range of causes. David Callahan charts the rise of these new power players and the ways they are converting the fortunes of a second Gilded Age into influence. He shows how this elite works behind the scenes on education, the environment, science, LGBT rights, and many other issues--with deep impact on government policy. Above all, he shows that the influence of the Givers is only just beginning, as new waves of billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg turn to philanthropy. Based on extensive research and interviews with countless donors and policy experts, this is not a brief for or against the Givers, but a fascinating investigation of a power shift in American society that has implications for us all.</p><p><b>DAVID CALLAHAN</b> is the author of seven previous nonfiction books including <i>The Cheating Culture: Why More Americans Are Doing Wrong to Get Ahead</i> and <i>Fortunes of Change: The Rise of the Liberal Rich and the Remaking America</i>. He is founder and editor of the media site Inside Philanthropy, and co-founder of the national think tank Demos. His writing has appeared in numerous publications, including <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>USA Today</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>The</i> <i>Washington Post</i>, and he is a frequent media commentator. He is a graduate of Hampshire College and holds a Ph.D. in politics from Princeton University.Chapter 1<br><br>The Coming of Big Philanthropy<br><br>As Michael Bloomberg prepared to step down as mayor of New York City, after twelve years on the job, he said that among his goals after leaving office was to start running outside again, which hadn&#x2019;t been practical with a security detail while mayor. He also said he wanted to &#x201c;sleep in a bit.&#x201d; Bloomberg had spent years waking up at six a.m. and working till ten p.m. or eleven p.m. at night. Just after leaving office, in January 2014, he and his partner, Diana Taylor, headed off to Hawaii and New Zealand for a two-week vacation&#x2014;his first real vacation in over a decade.<br><br>Later, as Bloomberg settled into his post-mayoral life, it became clear that he wouldn&#x2019;t be relaxing much. Bloomberg soon plunged back into the day-to-day management of his massive media company, Bloomberg L.P. In less than a year, the CEO of the company, Daniel Doctoroff, would be gone as Bloomberg reasserted his control.<br><br>Bloomberg also turned to philanthropy in a bigger way after he left office. Even as he amassed great wealth, starting in the 1980s, Bloomberg had always planned to give away most of that money. He lived extravagantly, to be sure, owning a private jet and some thirteen properties around the world by 2013&#x2014;which included estates in London, Bermuda, the Hamptons, and Westchester County&#x2014;but he gave on an equally large level.<br><br>Bloomberg had no interest in an older model of philanthropy, whereby business titans waited to the end of their lives or left the job to their heirs. Instead, he believed in giving as much as he could while still alive, a logic he pushed to other donors.<br><br>Bloomberg once recalled how, in the 1990s, he talked to a wealthy benefactor who planned to leave Johns Hopkins University $50 million upon his death. &#x201c;But I asked him: Why wait? Why deny financial aid to this generation? Why deny a possible cure for a disease to this generation?&#x201d; The donor changed his mind, giving all the money immediately. Over many years, Bloomberg himself channeled some $1 billion to Johns Hopkins, his alma mater. In a 2010 public statement about his giving intentions, Bloomberg had written &#x201c;that the reality of great wealth is that you can&#x2019;t spend it and you can&#x2019;t take it with you.&#x201d;<br><br>Bloomberg&#x2019;s fortune is vast indeed. When he started his media company, which came to dominate the market for financial data, he covered many of the start-up costs himself, drawing on a large severance package he had gotten from his former Wall Street employer, Salomon Brothers. Later, Bloomberg bought back stakes in his company from other early investors. As a result, he ended up owning 88 percent of a company that now has nineteen thousand employees and $9 billion in annual revenue. During his years as mayor, the value of the company had grown steadily. Bloomberg was worth just under $5 billion as he took office in 2002. By the time he left, that figure had soared to $33 billion. Within two years of leaving City Hall, his wealth had climbed higher still, to over $40 billion.<br><br>That kind of money isn&#x2019;t easy to give away. For example, if Bloomberg gave as much annually as did the legendary Rockefeller Foundation, it would take him almost three centuries to dispose of his fortune. To make any dent in giving away his wealth, Bloomberg has to give on the level of Bill Gates or George Soros, who rank among the world&#x2019;s top mega-donors.<br><br>Bloomberg had been an active philanthropist before becoming mayor, and he started giving more once at City Hall. Among other things, he gave many millions to nonprofit groups around the city&#x2014;giving that some saw as a naked effort to co-opt critics and bolster his power. Bloomberg offered a more benign explanation: he was simply using private funds to pay for priorities that the city couldn&#x2019;t afford. Regardless, never before had a major public official in the United States so adroitly used philanthropy to advance his agenda&#x2014;just as Bloomberg set a new record for spending his own money to get elected in the first place.<br><br>Bloomberg also quietly built up the infrastructure for his philanthropy during his years in government. He bought a $45 million Beaux-Arts mansion on 78th and Madison Avenue in 2006 to house his foundation, and in 2010, he appointed his longtime aide Patricia Harris as CEO of Bloomberg Philanthropies, a job she took on even while still working at City Hall. Harris led the push to organize and staff the foundation over subsequent years&#x2014;getting ready for much bigger giving to come.<br><br>In 2013, his last year in office, Bloomberg quietly gave away around $450 million&#x2014;an amount nearly as great as the Ford Foundation&#x2019;s annual grantmaking. Big chunks of that money went to finance a global version of the &#x201c;nanny&#x201d; agenda that Bloomberg had pursued as mayor. He put up millions of dollars for a worldwide push against smoking, as well as an effort to reduce traffic deaths in poorer countries. Bloomberg also gave big to combat climate change. In 2011, he had given the Sierra Club its biggest gift ever&#x2014;$50 million to try to shut down coal-fired power plants around the United States.<br><br>After he left City Hall, Bloomberg moved even more aggressively with his philanthropy. Within a month, he announced a $53 million commitment to fight overfishing and reform fishing practices. That issue might sound obscure to most people, but not to Bloomberg. As he said in making his gift: &#x201c;While billions of people depend on fish for food or income, only 13 percent of the world&#x2019;s fisheries are safe from being over-fished, presenting serious environmental and public health challenges. Data shows the world&#x2019;s severely threatened fish populations can rebound if fishing is properly managed.&#x201d;<br><br>Billions of hungry people, disappearing healthy food, and&#x2014;best of all&#x2014;data-driven solutions. This was Mike Bloomberg&#x2019;s kind of issue.<br><br>A month later, Bloomberg put up $10 million to help prevent children from accidentally drowning in Bangladesh. And the big numbers would keep coming. In fall 2014, Bloomberg announced he was putting another $125 million into work to cut the global carnage of traffic deaths. His foundation also rolled out an initiative to support public art in U.S. cities, on top of tens of millions of dollars Bloomberg had already donated to the arts. Meanwhile, additional grants bankrolled efforts to help cities in the United States and other countries become more innovative.<br><br>There was more, too. During his first eighteen months out of office, Bloomberg doubled down on his giving to the Sierra Club to fight coal plants, expanded his global fight against smoking, and pledged $50 million to support global reproductive health and rights.<br><br>As mayor of New York, Bloomberg was famously obsessed with data, and with identifying practical ways to improve life in the city. As a philanthropist, he&#x2019;s also driven by a keen pragmatism. Whereas many billionaires are drawn to the hardest problems or the trendiest causes, Bloomberg operates in a more utilitarian way when deciding where to put his biggest money&#x2014;crunching the numbers to figure out how his giving can do the most good.<br><br>Neither of the two biggest causes he has invested in over the years&#x2014;reducing tobacco use and improving traffic safety&#x2014;register much in the glittery precincts of philanthropy, but Bloomberg has picked two real winners. Smoking kills six million people worldwide every year, which is far more than AIDS and malaria put together. That number is projected to rise to eight million by 2030. A funder who bends this curve even slightly can save untold lives, which is why Bloomberg has so far poured at least $600 million into the cause. The same goes for road safety, where the body count is also huge: 1.25 million people die annually from accidents and tens of millions are injured. His foundation estimates that some 125,000 lives will be saved as a result of Bloomberg&#x2019;s investment of more than a quarter of a billion dollars in road safety activities across the world. Sounds like a bargain, right? Meanwhile, Bloomberg&#x2019;s quest to shut down coal-fired power plants&#x2014;a cause to which he&#x2019;s now given over $130 million&#x2014;is a twofer: shuttering such plants reduces carbon dioxide emissions but also lowers old-fashioned air pollution, saving lives. In early 2015, Bloomberg estimated that 5,500 lives annually were already being saved because of coal plant shutdowns in recent years.<br><br>Bloomberg is a savvy philanthropist in another way: He understands that influencing government is often the best way to get things done and focuses much of his giving on leveraging changes in public policy.<br><br>In a sweeping statement of his philanthropic strategy in early 2015, Bloomberg wrote: &#x201c;Some still see philanthropy as an alternative to government. I see it as a way to embolden government.&#x201d; He went on: &#x201c;Governments have the authority to drive change in ways that philanthropic organizations cannot. By leveraging our resources, and forming partnerships with government, philanthropic organizations can help push those changes forward.&#x201d; That mind-set, said Bloomberg, was &#x201c;at the heart of everything&#x201d; that his foundation did.<br><br>In 2014, Bloomberg&#x2019;s annual giving totaled $462 million. The following year, it totaled $510 million. With tens of billions of dollars to give away, this gusher of donations isn&#x2019;t likely to stop anytime soon.<br><br>Bloomberg has a reputation as a nonpartisan pragmatist, even as he&#x2019;s taken on climate change and gun violence, and he doesn&#x2019;t strike many as a scary figure. He is not feared the way that progressives fear the Koch brothers or conservatives fear George Soros. But the plain facts about Bloomberg are actually rather unnerving: One of the world&#x2019;s wealthiest men has openly said that he plans to spend the bulk of his fortune to influence government policies, not just in America but around the planet. <br><br>If you don&#x2019;t know much about philanthropy&#x2014;and few Americans do&#x2014;you may have imagined that Michael Bloomberg&#x2019;s run as a power player would end when he stepped down as mayor of New York. Of course, nothing of the kind was true. He simply pivoted to pull other levers of influence. Bloomberg, who used his great wealth to buy his way into office, now turned to using that wealth to push changes that could have more impact on the lives of more people than anything he did as mayor.<br><br>Bloomberg will give away billions in coming years at the same time that any number of great fortunes are harnessed to philanthropy. And just as few Americans are following what New York&#x2019;s ex-mayor is doing, neither are they paying attention to what some of the nation&#x2019;s other wealthiest people are up to&#x2014;or the degree to which they&#x2019;re deploying their fortunes to have a say over the great issues of the day. That power, I should add, doesn&#x2019;t just rest in the hands of those giving wealth away. It also is wielded by the people the givers entrust with their money, whether it&#x2019;s largely unknown foundation staff like Patricia Harris&#x2014;who&#x2019;s been called one of the most powerful women in the world&#x2014;or equally unknown heirs, like the three children of Warren Buffett, who together give away a larger sum every year than Michael Bloomberg. The philanthropic elite now emerging is not just more influential than most people realize; it&#x2019;s more extensive, commanding a growing array of institutions that reach into nearly every corner of American society.<br><br>the new Wealth<br><br>There are two parts to the story of the great power shift unfolding in U.S. society. One part is about the rising tide of philanthropic giving; the second is about the declining ability of government to solve big problems and provide public goods.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s start with the new private money.<br><br>For all the philanthropy we&#x2019;ve seen in recent years, it&#x2019;s nothing compared to what lies ahead.<br><br>To many of today&#x2019;s billionaires, mega-giving is the logical endgame to careers spent amassing such vast fortunes that philanthropy is the only real place the money can go. A similar phenomenon played out a century ago, when the historic fortunes of the early industrial age amassed by Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and others were used to endow large foundations that went on to wield huge influence in America and the world. This time, though, everything is bigger&#x2014;both the wealth and the clout that comes with it.<br><br>How much money are we talking about? More than you think.<br><br>Even if you&#x2019;re generally aware of the crazily large fortunes piling up at the very tippy top of the income ladder in our second Gilded Age&#x2014;say, because you thumb through the Forbes 400 special issue now and again&#x2014;chances are that you still don&#x2019;t realize just how big the fortunes at the top have become. Or how much bigger they are likely to get.<br><br>Take Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. They&#x2019;re long-familiar figures, as two of the richest men in America. But if you haven&#x2019;t been paying attention, you may not have noticed that both have gotten much richer over the past decade. Buffett added $25 billion to his fortune between 2005 and 2015. Gates added even more, pushing his net worth to nearly $80 billion.<br><br>And these fortunes may rise even further. While Gates still owns large amounts of Microsoft stock, he has largely deployed his fortune in private venture capital investments that could bring substantial returns as they mature in coming years. Buffett, meanwhile, has lately been making a string of bold acquisitions that could boost Berkshire Hathaway&#x2019;s fabled stock even further into the stratosphere down the line.<br><br>Or consider Mark Zuckerberg. Amid the uproar over his plans to give away $45 billion in Facebook stock, almost nobody mentioned an obvious point: The actual amount could end up being far greater than that. While Facebook&#x2019;s 2012 IPO was famously a disaster, its stock began a quiet upward tear in 2014, eventually soaring to over $100 a share. The smart money snickers that Facebook is overpriced and that the tech bubble will burst any day now. And maybe it will. But if the value of Facebook ever comes close to that of other top tech giants (like Google or Apple), Zuckerberg, who owns a huge stake in the company, will be far richer than he is today.<br><br>Gates, Buffett, Bloomberg, and Zuckerberg aren&#x2019;t the only billionaires who&#x2019;ve gotten much wealthier in the past decade&#x2014;a period, by the way, when the median net worth of all U.S. households fell thanks to the housing crash. The fortunes of the wealthy have kept soaring across multiple industries and through the ups and downs of the business cycle. New-economy billionaires have gotten much richer&#x2014;Larry Ellison added $40 billion to his wealth between 2005 and 2015, Jeff Bezos added $42 billion&#x2014;but so have titans of the old economy. David and Charles Koch, for example, had a combined net worth of $9 billion in 2005. In 2015, that figure stood at around $85 billion, a huge gain that helps explain why the Koch brothers have had plenty of extra cash to pour into politics and philanthropy lately. Phil Knight of Nike gained $17 billion in new wealth during the decade. Sheldon Adelson, the casino mogul, doubled his wealth to $26 billion.</p><h2>Theomatics: God&#39;s Best Kept Secret Revealed</h2><p>Asserts that a mathematical design within the Bible, in the original Hebrew and Greek, provides proof that God did in fact write every word of the Old and New Testaments</p><p></p><h2>Charles Faudree Details</h2><p><p>Finishing accessories&#x2015;by far the most important part of decorating.</p> <p>The accessories we display, their color and texture, abundance or restraint, similarity or variety, combine to establish a unique personality for each room.

He has contributed to the <i>Yale Review</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, and <i>The Paris Review</i>. He lives in Washington, DC.McCourt is the author of perhaps the best novel about opera (Mawrdew Czgowchwz, 1975, his first book recently reissued by NYRB Classics) as well as the best novel about AIDS (Time Remaining, 1992). Queer Street marks his debut in nonfiction, if such it can be called. His fans formerly waited eight or nine years for the master of camp glamour perfection to issue a new novel, yet the years since the century's turn have brought three books in rapid succession. Is this new productivity linked to a newfound confidence born out of Harold Bloom's elevation of McCourt in his appendix to The Western Canon (1994)? In McCourt's historical collage, an autobiographical thread prevails: young Brooklyn boy discovers Manhattan, grows up instinctively drawn to the artistic and pleasure centers its title evokes. Yet the book swells to bursting with other elements essays on film, lists of essential gay bars, invented characters bursting into Compton-Burnett chitchat. His wit is superb. "One cannot help noticing that a remake of Vertigo set in San Francisco today would be untenable: there is almost no one in California who does not believe in channeling and retrieved memory from former lives." McCourt can sometimes strike a needlessly provocative note (he implies a devotion to the Log Cabin Republicans just, it seems, to annoy) but readers straight and gay will be dazzled by the erudition he displays in listing every important event that happened in gay Manhattan over a 40-year period. They're all here Cardinal Spellman pinching altar boys; Douglas Sirk's shrewd casting of Rock Hudson as U.S. everyman; The Golden Apple as quintessential A-Gay musical. The staggering scale, the lighthearted valor and, most strikingly, a heavy reliance on Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1950 film All About Eve make this book, in every sense of the word, monumental: a Mount Rushmore with the familiar presidents' faces chipped away, replaced with those of Leonie Rysanek, Luchino Visconti, James Schuyler and Bette Davis. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dialectical Materialism: An Introduction (Complete Edition) Vol. 1 - Materialism and the Dialectical Method Vol. 2 - Historical ...

Trained in England, she has her own bookbinding studio and teaches classes at the Cincinnati Art AcademyMaybe it's because the book as physical object seems threatened these days that people are becoming more interested in the art of making books by hand. And it's an art available to almost anyone--for many traditional types of handmade books no special skills are needed, and no materials are required that cannot be found in a good art supply store. Fox, who owns a bookbinding studio, presents 11 projects that even the complete beginner should not find too daunting. The book begins by describing the various tools involved, from bodkins and bone folders to adhesives. Unfortunately, there isn't very much information about the many kinds of machinemade and handmade papers available. The section on tools is followed by a chapter on terminology and techniques. Projects range from a simple folded tunnel book and nonadhesive accordion book to several sewn bindings to a slipcase and a portfolio. For each project Fox includes examples of more complex variations, and she also provides a list of suppliers.

Our perspectives narrowed by hindsight, the world of that year is reduced to its most frivolous features last summers in grand aristocratic residences or its most destructive ones: the unresolved rivalries of the great European powers, the fear of revolution, violence in the Balkans.<br><br>In this illuminating history, Charles Emmerson liberates the world of 1913 from this prelude to war&#x201d; narrative, and explores it as it was, in all its richness and complexity. Traveling from Europe's capitals, then at the height of their global reach, to the emerging metropolises of Canada and the United States, the imperial cities of Asia and Africa, and the boomtowns of Australia and South America, he provides a panoramic view of a world crackling with possibilities, its future still undecided, its outlook still open.<br><br>The world in 1913 was more modern than we remember, more similar to our own times than we expect, more globalized than ever before. The Gold Standard underpinned global flows of goods and money, while mass migration reshaped the world's human geography. Steamships and sub-sea cables encircled the earth, along with new technologies and new ideas. Ford's first assembly line cranked to life in 1913 in Detroit. The Woolworth Building went up in New York. While Mexico was in the midst of bloody revolution, Winnipeg and Buenos Aires boomed. An era of petro-geopolitics opened in Iran. China appeared to be awaking from its imperial slumber. Paris celebrated itself as the city of light Berlin as the city of electricity.<br><br>Full of fascinating characters, stories, and insights, <i>1913: In Search of the World before the Great War</i> brings a lost world vividly back to life, with provocative implications for how we understand our past and how we think about our future. <br></p><p><b>Charles Emmerson</b> was born in Australia and grew up in London. After graduating top of his class in modern history from Oxford University, he took up an Entente Cordiale scholarship to study international relations and international public law in Paris. The author of <i>The Future History of the Arctic</i>, he writes and speaks widely on international affairs. He is a senior research fellow at Chatham House (the Royal Institute for International Affairs).<b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br> [Emmerson draws] upon an impressive range of contemporary source material, ranging from travel guides and memoirs to unpublished diaries, newspaper reports and diplomatic memos.

The effect is transporting; 1913 is both passport and time machine The centenary of the Great War will no doubt see the publication of many fine histories of the conflict, but few are likely to paint so alluring a portrait of the world that was consumed by it and that helped bring it about.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Daily Beast</b><br> With the looming 100th anniversary of World War I, a spate of books about the not-so-Great War have begun to emerge. Emmerson's effort stands out for several reasons. First, Emmerson ranges widely, from Germany to Paris, from Bombay to Tokyo. Second, he is a sparkling writer, his narrative rarely flags and he has amassed a startling amount of detail.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>The Scotsman</i></b><br> It is an epic, sprawling panorama of a book, intended to show the moving world as it was, to bring the past to life in order to clarify the present. It's a monumentally ambitious aim.

His book girdles the earth in an impressive fashion and conjures up a world we have lost.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Sunday Business Post</i> (Ireland)</b><br> Emmerson's book is an ambitious effort But there is so much that captivates, particularly the entertaining social detail and anecdote, such as the fact it took three years to assess JP Morgan's gargantuan estate, which included 138 watches in one of his houses in London.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>The Economist</i></b><br> [Emmerson] aims not to explain what caused or was lost to the war, but to retrieve from the partial glare of hindsight the world in which it erupted. This is no modest undertaking. Mr Emmerson draws from a wide range of sources, including memoirs, billboards and newspapers, to recreate a year that was fairly uneventful. Not unlike Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time&#x201d;, the first instalments of which were published in 1913, his narrative finds coherence in the unremarkable [W]hat emerges is a rich portrait and an important set of ideas.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Financial Times</i></b><br> Emmerson offers an impressive sweep that marshals much detail along the way, though at times there is a sense of being on a historical package tour (Baedeker is, indeed, a frequently cited source) in which some city breaks are better rendered than others. But there are some gems. In the patchwork Austro-Hungarian empire, one could drive on both sides of the road and there were 10 official languages but no translators in parliament.

His panoramic depiction of the last year before the Great War permits us to see the world as it might have looked through contemporary eyes, in its full colour and complexity, with a sense of the future's openness' Emmerson is a superb guide and companion, whether inviting us to take a seat next to him in a favourite corner' of a Viennese cafe or to survey&nbsp;<i>tout Paris</i>&nbsp;from the Eiffel Tower. In many ways, his book works as a time-travelogue'; indeed, it frequently quotes contemporary tourist literature and travelers' accounts.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Christian Science Monitor</i></b><br> Emmerson's project would not be as compelling if he had simply focused on Europe, or on England and her colonies. The Great War was truly a global war, and the world of 1913 was truly a global society. In his book, Emmerson gives fair weight to societies around the world rather than presenting the year from a Eurocentric point of view.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Booklist</i></b><br> Portraying the European capitals of the next year's belligerent countries, Emmerson strikes a cosmopolitan tone by noting social interconnections linking London to Paris to Berlin to Constantinople.

That&#x2019;s the price of gazing upon perfection.<br><br><b>The small town: </b>which demonstrates the Italian genius for pleasant living: &#x201c;a congenial barber . . . a well-stocked newsstand . . . professionally made coffee and a proper pizza; bell towers we can recognize in the distance, and people with a kind word and a smile for everyone.&#x201d;<br><br>The chaos of the roads, the anarchy of the office, the theatrical spirit of the hypermarkets, and garrulous train journeys; the sensory reassurance of a church and the importance of the beach; the solitude of the soccer stadium and the crowded Italian bedroom; the vertical fixations of the apartment building and the horizontal democracy of the eat-in kitchen. As you venture to these and many other locations rooted in the Italian psyche, you realize that Beppe has become your Dante and shown you a country that &#x201c;has too much style to be hell&#x201d; but is &#x201c;too disorderly to be heaven.&#x201d; <br><br>Ten days, thirty places.

Italy is sexy. It offers instant attention and solace. But don't take Italy at face value. Or, rather, take it at face value if you want to, but don't complain later.<br><br>One American traveler wrote, "Italy is the land of human nature." If this is true--and it certainly sounds convincing--exploring Italy is an adventure. You're going to need a map.<br><br>So you'll be staying for ten days? Here's the deal: We'll take a look at three locations on each day of your trip. They'll be classics, the sort of places that get talked about a lot, perhaps because they are so little known. We'll start with an airport, since we're here. Then I'll try to explain the rules of the road, the anarchy of the office, why people talk on trains, and the theatrical nature of hotel life. We'll sit in judgment at a restaurant and feel the sensory reassurance of a church. We'll visit Italy's televisual zoo and appreciate how important the beach is. We'll experience the solitude of the soccer stadium, and realize how crowded the bedroom feels. We'll note the vertical fixations of the apartment building, and the transverse democracy of the living room--or, rather, the eat-in kitchen.<br><br>Ten days, thirty places. We've got to start somewhere if we want to find our way into the Italian mind.<br><br> ***<br><br>First of all, let's get one thing straight. Your Italy and our Italia are not the same thing. Italy is a soft drug peddled in predictable packages, such as hills in the sunset, olive groves, lemon trees, white wine, and raven-haired girls. Italia, on the other hand, is a maze. It's alluring, but complicated. In Italia, you can go round and round in circles for years. Which of course is great fun.<br><br>As they struggle to find a way out, many newcomers fall back on the views of past visitors. People like Goethe, Stendhal, Byron, and Twain always had an opinion about Italians, and couldn't wait to get home and write it down. Those authors are still quoted today, as if nothing had changed. This is not true. Some things have changed in our Italy. The problem is finding out what.<br><br>Almost all modern accounts of the country fall into one of two categories: chronicles of a love affair, or diaries of a disappointment. The former have an inferiority complex toward Italian home life, and usually feature one chapter on the importance of the family, and another on the excellence of Italian cooking. The diaries take a supercilious attitude toward Italian public life. Inevitably, there is censure of Italian corruption, and a section on the Mafia.<br><br>By and large, the chronicles of love affairs are penned by American women, who display love without interest in their descriptions of a seasonal Eden, where the weather is good and the locals are charming. The diaries of disappointment tend to be produced by British men, who show interest without love. They describe a disturbing country populated by unreliable individuals and governed by a public administration from hell.<br><br>Yet Italy is far from hellish. It's got too much style. Neither is it heaven, of course, because it's too unruly. Let's just say that Italy is an offbeat purgatory, full of proud, tormented souls each of whom is convinced he or she has a hotline to the boss. It's the kind of place that can have you fuming and then purring in the space of a hundred meters, or the course of ten minutes. Italy is the only workshop in the world that can turn out both Botticellis and Berlusconis. People who live in Italy say they want to get out, but those who do escape all want to come back.<br><br>As you will understand, this is not the sort of country that is easy to explain. Particularly when you pack a few fantasies in your baggage, and Customs lets them through.<br><br>***<br><br>Take this airport, for example. Whoever wrote that airports are nonplaces never visited Milan's Malpensa or Linate, or Rome's Fiumicino. Or, if they did pay a call, they must have been too busy avoiding people shouting into cell phones and not looking where they were going.<br><br>An airport in Italy is violently Italian. It's a zoo with air conditioning, where the animals don't bite and only the odd comment is likely to be poisonous. You have to know how to interpret the sounds and signals. Italy is a place where things are always about to happen. Generally, those things are unpredictable. For us, normality is an exception. Do you remember The Terminal? If the film had been set in Malpensa Airport, Tom Hanks wouldn't just have fallen in love with Catherine Zeta-Jones. He'd have founded a political party, promoted a referendum, opened a restaurant, and organized a farmers' market.<br><br>Look at the childlike joy on the faces of the people as they stroll into the shops. Note how inventive they are at thinking up ways to pass the time. Observe the deference to uniforms (any uniform, from passing pilots to cleaning staff). Authority has been making Italians uneasy for centuries, so we have developed an arsenal of countermeasures, from flattery to indifference, familiarity, complicity, apparent hostility, and feigned admiration. Study the emerging faces as the automatic doors of international arrivals open. They reveal an almost imperceptible hint of relief at getting past Customs. Obviously, almost all the arriving passengers have nothing to hide. It doesn't matter. There was a uniform, and now it's gone.<br><br>Note the relief giving way to affection as they retrieve their suitcases from the carousel. At the check-in desk, they weren't sure they would ever see their suitcases again, and did all they could to pass them off as hand luggage. Listen to the couples quarreling, their accusations lent extra ferocity by the embarrassment of performing in public ("Mario! You said you had the passports!"). Admire the rituals of the families coming back from holiday. These spoken exchanges--Mom wants to know where their son is; Dad shouts to the son; the son answers Dad; Dad tells Mom, who has disappeared in the meantime--are the same ones that echo in a New York hotel or a street market in London.<br><br>Malpensa encapsulates the nation. Only a naive observer would mistake this for confusion. Actually, it's performance art. It's improvisation by gifted actors. No one believes for one minute he or she is an extra. Everyone's a star, no matter how modest the part. Federico Fellini would have made a good prime minister, if he'd wanted the job. It takes an outstanding director to govern the Italians.<br><br>***<br><br>What else can you find out at an Italian airport? Well, Italians' signature quality--our passion for beauty--is in danger of becoming our number-one defect. All too often, it prevents us from choosing what is good.<br><br>Look at the cell-phone displays and the saleswomen perched on their stools. Many of them can't tell a cell phone from a remote control, but all are indisputably attractive. Do you know why the phone companies hire them instead of using skilled staff? Because that's what the public wants. People prefer good looks to good answers.<br><br>Think about it. There is a lesson to be learned. We are prepared to give up a lot for the sake of beauty, even when it doesn't come in a miniskirt. "Never judge a book by its cover" sounds like an oversimplification in Italian. We judge books by their covers, politicians by their smiles, professionals by their offices, secretaries by their posture, table lamps by their design, cars by their styling, and people by their title. It's no coincidence that one Italian in four is president of something. Look at the ads here in the airport. They're for cars, bags, and cosmetics. They don't say how good the products are. They tell us how irresistible we'll be if we buy them. As if we Italians needed that kind of reassurance.<br><br>***<br><br>If this passion for beauty stopped at saleswomen, clothes, table lamps, and automobiles, it would be no big deal. Sadly, it spills over into morality and, I repeat, induces us to confuse what is beautiful with what is good. Only in Italian does there exist an expression like <i>fare bella figura</i>. Think about that. It's an aesthetic judgment--it means "to make a good figure"--which is not quite the same thing as making "a good impression."<br><br>There's an elderly French lady in trouble over there. She's just collected two huge suitcases and can't find a baggage cart. If I went over and offered to help her, she'd probably accept. At that point, something curious would happen. I would split into two. While Beppe was being a Good Samaritan, Severgnini would observe the scene and offer congratulations. Beppe would then acknowledge his own compliment, and retire satisfied.<br><br>Ours is a sophisticated exhibitionism that has no need of an audience. Italians are psychologically self-sufficient. What's the problem? Well, we like nice gestures so much we prefer them to good behavior. Gestures gratify, but behaving takes an effort. Still, the sum of ten good deeds does not make a person good, just as ten sins do not necessarily add up to a sinner. Theologians distinguish between <i>actum</i> and <i>habitus</i>: a single incident is not as serious as a "habit," or "practice."<br>In other words, if you want to understand Italy, forget the guidebooks. Study theology.<br><br>***<br><br>An aesthetic sense that sweeps ethics aside. A formidable instinct for beauty. That's the first of our weak points. But there are others, for we are also exceptional, intelligent, sociable, flexible, and sensitive. Offsetting these are our good qualities. We are hypercritical, stay-at-homes, so conciliatory and peace-loving we seem cowardly, and so generous we look na�ve. Do you see why Italians are so disconcerting?

This magnificent eighth novel (after 2000's <i>Look to Windward</i>) of the Culture, an interstellar posthuman civilization of incredible wealth and technological sophistication, centers on three siblings: Ferbin and Oramen, the misfit heirs of conquering King Hausk of the Sarl, who rules a backward and patriarchal realm deep beneath the surface of the artificial Shellworld Sursamen, and their exiled sister, Djan, now a powerful agent of the Culture's Special Circumstances division. When King Hausk is murdered, Ferbin narrowly avoids the conspirators and sets out across the galaxy to ask Djan's help with revenge against the killer, now serving as Oramen's regent. Soon they learn of the horrific forces a hidden enemy is about to unleash on Sursamen, and must race to save the home that has rejected them both. Beautifully written and filled with memorable characters and startling technology, this tale of intricate politics and interstellar warfare ably demonstrates that Banks is still at the height of his powers. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Since then, however, incredible scientific discoveries have not only helped restore Lee&#x2019;s faith, but have strengthened it.</p> <p>Lee is not alone. More and more scientists, confronted with startling, cutting-edge evidence from many areas of research, no longer believe the universe just &#x201c;happened&#x201d; or that life arose by mere chance. Behind a universe of staggering complexity, they are seeing signs of a Master Designer.</p> <p>Are your science textbooks still telling you the same &#x201c;facts&#x201d; that Lee&#x2019;s did years ago? Prepare to be astonished by what some of today&#x2019;s most respected experts have to say about:</p> <ul> <li>The birth of the universe</li> <li>Darwinism and the origin of life</li> <li>The astounding fine-tuning of the cosmos</li> <li>Amazing molecular machines and DNA research</li></ul> <p>Weigh the evidence for yourself. Then consider this question: Could it be that the universe looks designed ... because it is?</p></p><p>Are Christianity and science incompatible? If there is a God, is he only an impersonal starter force? An introductory high school biology class first propelled Lee Strobel toward a life of atheism. God and science, he reasoned, were mutually exclusive. When the former legal editor of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> converted to Christianity, he decided to investigate the science he had once accepted as truth. Did science point toward or away from God? As Strobel interviews a variety of scientists on everything from debunking evolutionary icons to the implications of the Big Bang to the existence of the human soul, he builds his case: scientific evidence points toward Intelligent Design. <p> Although the discussion often veers into the academic, Strobel works hard to make it accessible to those without scientific training. Throughout the book, he salts interview transcript information with interesting personal stories of his own spiritual and scientific quest for knowledge, as well as sometimes over-detailed descriptions of the actual interviews (right down to the type of beverages consumed). Each chapter contains suggestions for further reading on particular issues of science and faith. </p><p> Strobel concludes that, when correctly interpreted, science and biblical teaching support each other. He quotes physicist Paul Davies, "...science offers a surer path to God than religion." Open-minded readers will find that this book, and its questions for reflection and group study, invites conversation and investigation.--<i>Cindy Crosby</i></p>In The Case for a Creator--Student Edition, best-selling author and former atheist Lee Strobel and popular writer Jane Vogel take younger readers on a remarkable investigation into the origin of the universe, interviewing many of the world's most renown scientists and following the evidence wherever it leads.Their findings--presented in the third blockbuster &#x201c;Case&#x201d; book student edition--offer the most compelling scientific proof ever for intelligent design.

Lavishly illustrated with more than seventy-five boxes and collages, as well as images of the fascinating source material that the artist collected to create his exquisitely crafted worlds, it communicates to the reader the sense of surprise and delight that one experiences on viewing the actual boxes with their toys, stuffed birds, maps, clay pipes, marbles, shells, and other paraphernalia of daily life. The book&#x2019;s essays bring together the expertise of Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, former director of the Joseph Cornell Study Center; the compelling commentary of Walter Hopps, art dealer, museum curator and director, and the artist&#x2019;s personal friend; the wide-ranging scholarship of Richard Vine; and the sensitivity of Robert Lehrman, a leading Cornell collector whose firsthand experience lends this publication its distinctive intimacy. Among the topics explored are the role of dualities in the artistic process, the dominant themes of Cornell&#x2019;s oeuvre, and the importance of his Christian Science faith. 231 illustrations, 205 in color</p><p><p><b>Lynda Roscoe Hartigan</b> is Chief Curator of the Peabody Essex Museum and former director of the Joseph Cornell Study Center.</p><p><b>Walter Hopps</b> is an art dealer and museum curator and director.</p><p><b>Richard Vine</b> is a wide-ranging scholar.</p><p><b>Robert Lehrman</b> is a leading Cornell collector.</p>The title of this extensive survey of Joseph Cornell's work, which ranges from his early collages to his famous "boxes," is drawn from Cornell's own designation for a concept of time indicating the eternal within the everyday. This idea very much informs the attitude of the various contributors to the volume-which comes with a DVD-ROM (not seen by PW) and is published to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Cornell's birth-who concentrate more on the mystical and emotional aspects of Cornell's work, as opposed to the conceptual or technical. While this inevitably leads to a preoccupation with Cornell's religious and sexual preferences, it also lends a charming accessibility and warmth to the text. The contributors do not hesitate to infuse their comments on individual pieces with their own personal experience with the work, which should particularly help neophytes of Cornell's work understand his appeal to such a broad spectrum of viewers. On Cornell's "Untitled [`Dovecote' American Gothic]," Hartigan writes, "I placed this box by my favorite chair, and over the years came to experience a serene sense of comfort and companionship embodied in the simple whitewashed habitation." More than 200 color illustrations of Cornell's work (along with 30 b&amp;w) are placed against black backgrounds and categorized into topics meant to reflect Cornell's own fascinations, such as "Chests and Cabinets," "Habitats," "Aviaries" and "Celestial Navigation Variants." While the darkness of the backgrounds conveys to a certain extent the mysteriousness of Cornell's work, it also obscures some of the more shadowed pieces, and the categories, occasionally only three or four pages long, can seem arbitrary and exclusionary. However, the sheer sumptuousness of the reproductions and the personal enthusiasm of the authors, along with Cornell's own undeniable mystique, does much to overcome this, making the volume a fine introduction to an often misunderstood artist. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Camping &amp; Wilderness Survival, 2nd: The Ultimate Outdoors Book</h2><p><p>&#x201c;The Ultimate Outdoors Book&#x201d; with 31 chapters of well researched camping and survival techniques. &nbsp;This guide covers everything from fire making to first aid, building shelters, winter travel and much more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;<b><i>Camping &amp; Wilderness Survival </i></b><i>actually lives up to the hype of its subtitle. <b>The Ultimate Outdoors Book</b> is the fullest and finest work in the field since Horace Kephart&#x2019;s timeless Camping and Woodcraft was published almost a century ago. ...I have read voraciously on camping and the outdoors all my life and possess a personal library of several thousand volumes in this field.

He says, &#34;The stream of human knowledge is like a great river; many streams and rivulets make up its volume. Of course not every prophet of healing today contributes to our knowledge, for some are fraudulent, their waters polluted; and some dry up and never reach the flowing river of valid human knowledge. Yet it remains true that we must expect insights from many different sources if our knowledge of the sources, enriched by the sufferings and discoveries of the people who have consulted me over the years, the insights into healing from wells ancient and modern: ancient Greek healing mysteries, the lore of shamanism, the wisdom of he American Indian, the healing emphasis in early Christianity and the very modern perspective on healing furnished by C. G. Jung. The hope is that the reader will, through this book, see a little more clearly where healing comes from and where he or she as a person can learn to help himself or herself. But it is not a complete book on healing nor does it pretend to be. There is far more to be said about healing that this book, or any one book, can say, though hopefully the reader will find some insights that are new and helpful.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Disappearances: Another Spirited Novel By The Bestselling Amish Author!

A triumph of vivid description, telling anecdotes, and informed analysis.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<em>The New York Review of Books</em> </p><p>"Britain's finest contemporary military historian." <br>&#x2014; <em>The Economist</em> </p><p>An epic joint biography of four titanic figures&#x2014;a President, a Prime Minister, and two Generals&#x2014;who shaped the grand strategy of the Allies during World War II.</p></p><p><p>An epic joint biography, <em>Masters and Commanders</em> explores the degree to which the course of the Second World War turned on the relationships and temperaments of four of the strongest personalities of the twentieth century: political masters Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt and the commanders of their armed forces, General Sir Alan Brooke and General George C. Marshall. Each was exceptionally tough willed and strong minded, and each was certain that he knew best how to win the war. Yet each knew that he had to win at least two of the others if he was to have his strategy adopted. Andrew Roberts, whom <em>The Economist</em> calls "Britain's finest contemporary military historian," traces the mutual suspicion and admiration, the rebuffs and the charm, the often-explosive disagreements and wary reconciliations, and he helps us to appreciate the motives and imperatives acting upon these key leaders struggling to destroy Nazism. </p><p>Drawing on newly discovered verbatim accounts of Churchill's war-cabinet meetings and on the private papers of nearly seventy contemporaries, Roberts reconstructs the lively debates of the four principals and other leading figures, and attempts to answer some of the key questions of Allied strategy. Why, when the most direct route from Germany to Britain was through north-western France, did the Western Allies launch attacks via North Africa, Sicily, and Rome? Why, if Operation Overlord in June 1944 was intended to be the start of the Allies' great thrust into Germany, did four hundred thousand men land five hundred miles to the south, in southern France, two months later? Why did the Allies not take Berlin, Vienna, or Prague and allow the Iron Curtain to descend where it did? </p><p><em>Masters and Commanders</em> dramatically re-creates the atmosphere, debates, and maneuverings through which Allied grand strategy was forged and reveals the profound impact of personality upon history.</p><p>Andrew Roberts is the author of <em>Masters and Commanders</em> and <em>A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900.</em> His other books include <em>Napoleon and Wellington, Eminent Churchillians,</em> and <em>Salisbury,</em> which won the Wolfson History Prize.

Whether on the street or the football field, in a classroom or a boardroom. Wouldn't you be tempted to try it . . . just once? What happens if it releases uncontrollable rage and makes you a killer? </p><p>Jack finds himself fighting against the makers and sellers of this dangerous new street drug. The drug brings out the user's most aggressive behavior, gifting the user with a God-like feeling -- useful in small doses, but also capable of sending the user into a mindless, destructive rage. After checking around, Jack realizes that the drug comes from a most surprising source. . . . a source that may have deadly effects on Jack's life and the lives of those he cares most about . . .</p><p>It's up to Jack to destroy this source, put an end to it and save countless lives . . . even though it may cost him his own.</p></p><p>Reading a Repairman Jack novel seems, at times, a guilty pleasure; it's astonishingly easy to inhale the pages, like eating potato chips. A firm-jawed Mr. Fixit hero with a cryptic past--<i>crunch</i>! Crimes that go beyond (way, waaay beyond) the norms of traditional law--<i>smack</i>! A liberal sprinkling of screwball comedy <i>and</i> nasty supernatural beings--now <i>that's</i> tasty! Good, crispy fun, indeed. But F. Paul Wilson's tight plotting and appealing characters manage to elevate potato chips to the realm of haute cuisine (or at least a satisfyingly solid meal), and his latest, <i>All the Rage</i>, is no exception. <p> Everything's rosy when Nadia Radzminsky takes a dream research job at GEM Pharmaceuticals: she'll be working for her professional idol, Dr. Luc Monnet; her fianc� is one of GEM's top salespeople; she's got all sorts of high tech toys to play with; and she'll get a million-dollar bonus if she can just figure out how to stabilize GEM's most promising molecule (dubbed, ominously enough for students of Norse mythology, Loki). But clouds quickly appear on the horizon in the form of Milos Dragovic, a Serbian mobster with a short fuse, a big wallet, and a profound interest in Loki's future. Nadia suspects Milos is blackmailing her boss, and she hires Jack to find out what's going on.</p><p> What Jack finds out isn't pretty: Loki is leading an underground life as Berzerk, a hot, new street drug that brings out the user's most aggressive behavior, frequently with deadly consequences. And Milos may be pushing Monnet around, but the good doctor isn't objecting too strongly to the payoff. But when Jack gets closer to the source of the mystery molecule, events take a very personal turn: Loki is derived from the blood of rakoshi, those otherworldly and decidedly vicious demons Jack had sworn to exterminate in <i>Conspiracies</i>. With his family threatened by both the rakoshi and the vengeful Serb, Jack must take on both the monster and the mob. </p><p> <i>All the Rage</i> has the necessary ingredients for success, including a snarkily amusing subplot involving a Brooklyn junkyard owner who's also out for Milos's blood (Jack has to keep toning down his client's eager revenge plots, and his substitution of industrial sludge for knives in one such plan is particularly amusing). Dedicated Wilson fans will rejoice in the new addition to the series, and neophytes will scramble to unearth the earlier installments. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>This is the signed limited edition of ALL THE RAGE, signed by Harry O.

Esoteric philosophies and personas&#x2014;from Freemasonry to Spiritualism, from Madame H. P. Blavatsky to Edgar Cayce&#x2014;dramatically altered the nation&#x2019;s culture, politics, and religion. Yet the mystical roots of our identity are often ignored or overlooked. Opening a new window on the past, <b>Occult America</b><i> </i>presents a dramatic, pioneering study of the esoteric undercurrents of our history and their profound impact across modern life.</p></p><p><strong>Book Description</strong><br> It touched lives as disparate as those of Frederick Douglass, Franklin Roosevelt, and Mary Todd Lincoln--who once convinced her husband, Abe, to host a s�ance in the White House. Americans all, they were among the famous figures whose paths intertwined with the mystical and esoteric movement broadly known as the occult. Brought over from the Old World and spread throughout the New by some of the most obscure but gifted men and women of early U.S. history, this &#x201c;hidden wisdom&#x201d; transformed the spiritual life of the still-young nation and, through it, much of the Western world.<br> <p>Yet the story of the American occult has remained largely untold. Now a leading writer on the subject of alternative spirituality brings it out of the shadows. Here is a rich, fascinating, and colorful history of a religious revolution and an epic of offbeat history.</p> <p>From the meaning of the symbols on the one-dollar bill to the origins of the Ouija board, Occult America briskly sweeps from the nation&#x2019;s earliest days to the birth of the New Age era and traces many people and episodes, including:</p> <p>� The spirit medium who became America&#x2019;s first female religious leader in 1776<br> � The supernatural passions that marked the career of Mormon prophet Joseph Smith<br> � The rural Sunday-school teacher whose clairvoyant visions instigated the dawn of the New Age<br> � The prominence of mind-power mysticism in the black-nationalist politics of Marcus Garvey<br> � The Idaho druggist whose mail-order mystical religion ranked as the eighth-largest faith in the world during the Great Depression</p> <p>Here, too, are America&#x2019;s homegrown religious movements, from transcendentalism to spiritualism to Christian Science to the positive-thinking philosophy that continues to exert such a powerful pull on the public today. A feast for believers in alternative spirituality, an eye-opener for anyone curious about the unknown byroads of American history, <em>Occult America</em> is an engaging, long-overdue portrait of one nation, under many gods, whose revolutionary influence is still being felt in every corner of the globe.</p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Mitch Horowitz on the Occult in American History</strong><br><br> Scholars of American history have often dismissed occult traditions, such as Spiritualism, Mesmerism, divination, channeling, and mental-healing, as little more than oddball social trends to be analyzed, fretted over, and debunked. This is a mistake. To really grasp the religious development of our nation, its occult movements and believers must be understood for what they are: communities of belief, who left a profound impact on the culture of America and the modern world.<br> <p>Early American history is entwined with esoteric spirituality. North America&#x2019;s first intentional mystical community reached its shores in the summer of 1694. That year, the determined spiritual philosopher Johannes Kelpius led about forty pilgrims out of Central Germany--a region decimated by the Thirty Years&#x2019; War--and to the banks of the Wissahickon Creek, just beyond Philadelphia. The city then hosted only about 500 houses, but it represented a Mecca of freedom for the Kelpius circle, who longed for a new homeland where they could practice their brands of astrology, alchemy, numerology, and mystical Christianity without fear of harassment from church or government.</p> <p>Soon more mystical thinkers from the Rhine Valley journeyed to America, building a larger commune at Ephrata, Pennsylvania. A young woman named Ann Lee fled persecution in her native Manchester, England and relocated her esoteric sect, the "Shaking Quakers"--or the Shakers--to upstate New York in 1776. That same year, a Rhode Island girl, Jemima Wilkinson, declared herself a spirit channeler, took the name Publick Universal Friend, and began to preach across the northeast. The trend was set: America became a destination for religious idealists, especially those of a supernatural bent.</p> <p>By the 1830s and 40s, a region of central New York State called "the Burned-Over District" (so-named for its religious passions) became the magnetic center for the religious radicalism sweeping the young nation. Stretching from Albany to Buffalo, it was the Mt. Sinai of American mysticism, giving birth to new religions such as Mormonism and Seventh-Day Adventism, and also to Spiritualism, mediumship, table-rapping, s�ances, and other occult sensations--many of which mirrored, and aided, the rise of Suffragism and related progressive movements. The nation&#x2019;s occult culture gave women their first opportunity to openly serve as religious leaders--in this case as spirit mediums, seers, and channlers. America&#x2019;s social and spiritual radicals were becoming joined, and the partnership would never fade.</p> <p>Indeed, the robust growth of occult and mystical movements in nineteenth-century America--aided by the influence of Freemasonry and Transcendentalism--helped transform the young nation into a laboratory for religious experiment and a launching pad for the revolutions in alternative and New Age spirituality that eventually swept the globe. In the early twentieth century, the new spiritual therapies--from meditation to mind-body healing to motivational thinking--began revolutionizing how religion was understood in contemporary times: not only as a source of salvation but as a means of healing. In this sense, occult America had changed our world. <em>--Mitch Horowitz</em></p>Mitch Horowitz is the editor in chief of Tarcher/Penguin.

BOMC. First serial, National Geographic. Tour.</p><p>When David Breashears agreed to climb Mount Everest with an IMAX camera in order to film from the summit, he had no idea that his little expedition would become embroiled in a tragedy that would make headlines around the world. On May 10, 1996, two expeditions led by experienced Everest guides Rob Hall and Scott Fisher summited the mountain, only to suffer the loss of eight members--including the two leaders--on the way back down. At the time, Breashears and his filmmaking crew were at the base camp preparing for their own climb--originally planned for that same day but postponed after realizing there would already be several other groups on the summit. Instead of making a film, Breashears and company participated in the rescue and only later reached the summit of Everest to successfully complete their film. <p> Broughton Coburn, a long-time resident of Nepal and a friend of David Breashears, was commissioned to write a book about the filmmaking expedition, the tragedy on Everest, and the mountain itself. He has more than succeeded with <i>Everest: Mountain Without Mercy</i>, a taut recounting of disaster and triumph at 29,000 feet. But this book is about more than just mountain climbing; Coburn has also included fascinating information about Nepal, Buddhism, and the Sherpa culture, as well as the history of climbing Everest. He covers everything from the causes of altitude sickness to Nepal's increasing problems with deforestation, and through it all he weaves the story of that day in May when Everest again proved unpredictable--and deadly.

Armstrong is a thoroughgoing Texan jock, and the changes brought to his life by his illness are startling and powerful, but he's just not interested in wearing a hero suit. While his vocabulary is a bit on the he-man side (highest compliment to his wife: "she's a stud"), his actions will melt the most hard-bitten souls: a cancer foundation and benefit bike ride, his astonishing commitment to training that got him past countless hurdles, loyalty to the people and corporations that never gave up on him. There's serious medical detail here, which may not be for the faint of heart; from chemo to surgical procedures to his wife's in vitro fertilization, you won't be spared a single x-ray, IV drip, or unfortunate side effect.

But at what cost? <br><br>From the age of ten, when she made her acting debut on <i>Good Times, </i>Janet was told by Hollywood that she needed to slim down. Her well-meaning brothers, especially fun-loving Michael, teased her relentlessly until she began to believe that who she was wasn&#x2019;t good enough. It was an idea that no amount of critical acclaim in television and film or, later, international platinum success in music could change. <br><br>Janet turned to food for comfort and escape. She developed a self-destructive pattern familiar to so many of us: fear and uncertainty led to bad feelings about herself and ultimately depression. The depression led to overeating. And her yo-yoing weight was painfully obvious in the bright lights of the entertainment world. <br><br>It has taken Janet most of her adult life to come to terms with who she is. But she has finally broken free of the attitudes that brought her down and has embraced realistic goals that help her eat better, exercise better, feel better, and ultimately be better. <br><br>This book is about meeting those challenges that face all of us. With candor and courage, Janet shares her painful journey to loving herself. She addresses the crazy rumors that have swirled around her for most of her life, shines an intimate light on her family, and pulls us behind the velvet rope into her unforgettable career. She also shares lessons she has learned through contact with friends and fans and reveals the fitness secrets she has learned from her trainer. Finally, her nutritionist, David Allen, unveils the wholesome, delicious recipes and lifestyle-changing tips that helped Janet get in shape&#x2014;mind and spirit, heart and soul. <br><br><i>True You </i>is a call to tune in to your own fundamental wisdom, to let go of the ugly comparisons, and to understand that who you are, the <i>true you, </i>is more than enough. <br><br>***<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m loved, I&#x2019;m valued, and I&#x2019;m capable of achieving balance in my life. I can learn to eat well. I can exercise. I can express gratitude for the simple act of being able to breathe in and breathe out. I can move away from darkness and depression to light and hope. I can be happy with who I am, not what I should be, or what I might have been, or what someone tells me I must be. <br><br>I am me, the true me; you are you, the true you&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s good.

Heinlein and Tributes to the Grand Master</h2><p>A collection of Heinlein&#39;s works--including two major novellas, Destination Moon and Tenderfoot in Space--features contributions by Arthur C. Clarke, Tom Clancy, and others that pay tribute to Heinlein.</p><p>Another of science fiction's weird hybrids, comprising fiction, poems, speeches, reminiscences, and appreciations by and about Robert A. Heinlein (1907-88), one of the most successful and influential science fiction writers of the modern era. Part I features the famous title story, six previously uncollected miscellaneous pieces, and four speeches that Heinlein delivered at sf conventions. Part II reprints the speeches given at the Heinlein retrospective at the National Air and Space Museum in October 1988. Part II consists of tributes to the Grandmaster from, among others, Poul Anderson, Greg Bear, Arthur C. Clarke, Joe Haldeman, Larry Niven, Spider Robinson, Robert Silverberg, and Jack Williamson. Among the more interesting entries are ``Destination Moon,'' the story that formed the basis for the innovative 1950 movie, co-scripted by Heinlein; and Heinlein's account of his involvement in making the movie--essential reading for sf-movie buffs. Elsewhere, Spider Robinson's egregious, ranting defense of Heinlein against mostly unspecified detractors will raise a few eyebrows; contrast Robert Silverberg's panegyric, a more reliable summary of Heinlein's substantial and lasting contribution to the field. Sentimental hagiography. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The New Collected Works portion of this memorial to Heinlein ( Stranger in a Strange Land ) is a delight. Best of these stories, essays and speeches are "Shooting Destination Moon ," an essay on the movie that follows the story on which the film was based, and the prescient Guest of Honor speeches from the World Science Fiction Conventions of 1941 and 1961. Heinlein's contributions, while not necessarily representing his best work, are always thought-provoking and never boring. In contrast, the tributes by such luminaries as Tom Clancy, L. Sprague and Catherine Crook de Camp, Arthur C. Clarke and Spider Robinson offer tedious variations on adulation. The sole exception is Larry Niven's story "The Return of William Proxmire," in which the senator blocks the space program with a time machine. He keeps Heinlein in the Navy and forestalls the body of writing that would influence many to pursue careers in space.

It&#x2019;s the best part of a magazine identified, variously, as an "ultra-hip underground magazine" and a "hotch-potch of F-words, cocaine, music and sex with occasional rants about how &#x2018;stupid, lazy, older people should stop being so pathetic and shortsighted&#x2019;&nbsp;"&#x2014;and known to those who read it as being a publication full of irresistibly stupid stuff written by very smart people. The legend of the magazine&#x2019;s provenance is crucial ("Ten years ago two drunks and a junkie decided to take advantage of Montreal&#x2019;s many &#x2018;make work&#x2019; programs and start a government-funded magazine") to its appeal, and the Vice creators have spawned a kind of scruffy media empire out of their moments of juvenile genius. In the Dos &amp; Don&#x2019;ts, chief fashion analyst McInnis serves up wicked gems (many unprintable) to accompany the little photos. Of a man playing soccer in a Speedo, he writes, "You little Rikki-Tikki-Tavi in blue trunks&#x2014;mongoosing all over the place like Julian Lennon video"; of a child wearing a leather jacket, he writes "Dear Kids, I hate your tiny little guts. Thanks for making it worse by &#x2018;Born To Be Wild&#x2019;ing your self sic up like that poster in my Guidance Counsellor&#x2019;s sic office." When he&#x2019;s feeling complimentary, he says of two middle-aged Quebecoise, "Even after 40 they still rock the high heels and cleavage....while the English moms go the way of the track pant, the frogs will be wearing that garter belt all the way to the grave."

Patterned after the classic Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, the series will represent the most comprehensive work on the Indian Wars in the West yet published. Volume II: The Wars for the Pacific Northwest covers five distinct conflicts and their aftermaths: The Snake-Paiute War and After (1866-72), The Modoc War (1872-73), The Nez Perce Campaign (1877), The Bannock War (1878), and The Sheepeater Campaign (1879).

Thus, articles that provide conflicting views, such as Chief Joseph's and Oliver O. Howard's accounts of the Nez Perc&#x201a; Campaign of 1877, are placed together. Editing has been kept to a minimum and serves mainly to clarify the text and make it more readable. This is a useful addition to collections on the West, the Pacific Northwest, and Native Americans.

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League.

You guessed it: people get hurt.<b>Frank Miller</b> began his career in comics in the late 1970s, first drawing then writing <i>Daredevil</i> for Marvel Comics, creating what was essentially a crime comic disguised as a superhero book. It was on <i>Daredevil</i> that Miller gained notoriety, honed his storytelling abilities, and took his first steps toward becoming a giant in the comics medium. After <i>Daredevil</i> came <i>Ronin,</i> a science-fiction samurai drama that seamlessly melded Japanese and French comics traditions into the American mainstream; and after that, the groundbreaking and acclaimed <i>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</i> and <i>Batman: Year One</i>, both of which not only redefined the classic character, but also revitalized the industry itself. Finally able to fulfill his dream of doing an all-out, straight-ahead crime series, Miller introduced <i>Sin City</i> in 1991. Readers responded enthusiastically to Miller's tough-as-leather noir drama, creating an instant sales success. His multi-award-winning <i>300</i> series from Dark Horse, a telling of history's most glorious and underreported battle, was brought to full-blooded life in 1998. In 2001, Miller returned to the superhero genre with the bestselling <i>Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again</i>. Frank Miller continues to push the medium into new territories, exploring subject matter previously untouched in comics, and his work consistently receives the highest praise from his industry peers and readers everywhere. In 2005, with the hugely successful <i>Sin City</i> movie release, codirected with Robert Rodriguez, Miller added a director's credit to his already impressive r�sum� and introduced his characters to an entirely new legion of fans worldwide.</p><h2>The Keto All Day Cookbook: More Than 100 Low-Carb Recipes That Let You Stay Keto for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner (Volume 7) (7, 7)</h2><p><b>In <i>The&nbsp;</i><i>Keto All Day Cookbook</i>, best-selling author and creator of the KetoDiet blog&nbsp;Martina Slajerova compiles&nbsp;her best recipes for every meal of the day (even snacks)&#x2014;plus 17 new&nbsp;ones, accompanied by nearly 40 gorgeous new photos&#x2014;to help you stay the keto course, deliciously!</b><br><br> Keto is the top-trending supportive diet.

Neusner, whose books include Jews and Christians and (with Andrew M. Greeley) The Bible and Us , argues that the Jesus of the Gospel of St. Matthew called into question the primacy of the family and violated the sanctity of the Sabbath. Casting himself as a local rabbi in biblical times, Neusner engages in an imaginary dialogue with Jesus, a Jew who explicitly claimed that he came to fulfill the Torah, not to destroy it. To Neusner, Jesus's message, summed up as "leave home, follow me," shortchanged the priorities of home, family, community and the social order that the Torah had commanded Israel to bring into being. Neusner's earnest polemic will compel both Jews and Christians to look more deeply at the sources of their faith. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Land&#39;s End: A Walk in Provincetown (Crown Journeys)</h2><p>In this celebration of one of America's oldest towns (incorporated in 1720), Michael Cunningham, author of the best-selling, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <b>The Hours</b>, brings us Provincetown, one of the most idiosyncratic and extraordinary towns in the United States, perched on the sandy tip at the end of Cape Cod.<br><br>Provincetown, eccentric, physically remote, and heartbreakingly beautiful, has been amenable and intriguing to outsiders for as long as it has existed. "It is the only small town I know of where those who live unconventionally seem to outnumber those who live within the prescribed bounds of home and licensed marriage, respectable job, and biological children," says Cunningham. "It is one of the places in the world you can disappear into. It is the Morocco of North America, the New Orleans of the north."<br><br>He first came to the place more than twenty years ago, falling in love with the haunted beauty of its seascape and the rambunctious charm of its denizens. Although Provincetown is primarily known as a summer mecca of stunning beaches, quirky shops, and wild nightlife, as well as a popular destination for gay men and lesbians, it is also a place of deep and enduring history, artistic and otherwise. Few towns have attracted such an impressive array of artists and writers&#x2014;from Tennessee Williams to Eugene O'Neill, Mark Rothko to Robert Motherwell&#x2014;who, like Cunningham, were attracted to this finger of land because it was . . . different, nonjudgmental, the perfect place to escape to; to be rescued, healed, reborn, or simply to live <br>in peace. As we follow Cunningham on his various excursions through Provincetown and its surrounding landscape, we are drawn into its history, its mysteries, its peculiarities&#x2014;places you won't read about in any conventional travel guide.</p><p>Michael Cunningham is the author of<b> Flesh and Blood</b>, <b>A Home at the End of the World</b>, and, most recently, <b>The Hours</b>, winner of the Pulitzer Prize and soon to be a major film. He lives and works in New York City.PROLOGUE<br><br>There is a short interval on clear summer evenings in Provincetown, after the sun has set, when the sky is deep blue but the hulls of the boats in the harbor retain a last vestige of light that is visible nowhere else. They become briefly phosphorescent in a dim blue world. Last summer as I stood on the beach of the harbor, watching the boats, I found a coffee cup in the shallows. It's not unusual to find bits of crockery on this beach (Provincetown's harbor, being shaped like an enormous ladle, catches much of what the tides stir landward from the waters that surround Cape Cod), but a whole cup is rare. It was not, I'm sorry to say, the perfect little white china cup that poetry demands. It was in fact a cheap thing, made in the seventies I suppose, a graceless shallow oval, plastic (hence its practical but unflattering ability to survive intact), covered with garish orange and yellow daisies; the official flowers of the insistent, high-gloss optimism I remember from my adolescence, as talk of revolution dimmed and we all started, simply, to dance. It wasn't much of a cup, though it would outlast many of humankind's more vulnerable attempts to embody the notion of hope in everyday objects. It had gotten onto the beach in one piece, while its lovelier counterparts, concoctions of clay and powdered bone, white as moons, lay in fragments on the ocean floor. This cup contained a prim little clamshell, pewter-colored, with a tiny flourish of violet at its broken hinge, and a scattering of iridescent, mica-ish grit, like tea leaves, at its shallow bottom. I held it up, as if I expected to drink from it, as the boats put out their light.<br><br>LAND'S END<br><br>Provincetown stands on a finger of land at the tip of Cape Cod, the barb at the hook's end, a fragile and low-lying geological assertion that was once knitted together by the roots of trees. Most of the trees, however, were felled by early settlers, and now, with the forests gone, the land on which Provincetown is built is essentially a sandbar, tenuously connected to the mainland, continually reconfigured by the actions of tides. When Thoreau went there in the mid-1800s, he called it "a filmy sliver of land lying flat on the ocean, a mere reflection of a sand-bar on the haze above." It has not changed much since then, at least not when seen from a distance. Built as it is at the very end of the Cape, which unfurls like a genie's shoe from the coastline of Massachusetts, it follows the curve of a long, lazy spiral and looks not out to sea but in, toward the thicker arm of the Cape. The distant lights you see at night across the bay are the neighboring towns of Truro, Wellfleet, and Eastham. If you stand on the beach on the harbor side, the ocean proper is behind you. If you turned around, walked diagonally through town and across the dunes to the other side, and sailed east, you'd dock eventually in Lisbon. By land, the only way back from Provincetown is the way you've come.<br><br>It is by no means inaccessible, but neither is it particularly easy to reach. In the 1700s storms or changes in currents sometimes washed away the single road that connected Provincetown to the rest of Cape Cod, and during those times it was reachable only by boat. Even when the weather and the ocean permitted, carriages that negotiated the sandy road often got stuck and sometimes capsized into the surf. Provincetown is now more firmly and reliably attached. You can drive there. It's almost exactly two hours from both Boston and Providence, if you don't hit traffic, though in summer that's unlikely. You can fly over from Boston, twenty-five minutes across the bay, and if you're lucky you might see whales breaching from the plane. In summer, from mid-May to Columbus Day, a ferry sails twice a day from Boston. Provincetown is by nature a destination. It is the land's end; it is not en route to anywhere else. One of its charms is the fact that those who go there have made some effort to do so.<br><br>Provincetown is three miles long and just slightly more than two blocks wide. Two streets run its entire length from east to west: Commercial, a narrow one-way street where almost all the businesses are, and Bradford, a more utilitarian two-way street a block north of Commercial. Residential roads, some of them barely one car wide, run at right angles on a semiregular grid between Commercial and Bradford streets and then, north of Bradford, meander out into dunes or modest hollows of surviving forest, as the terrain dictates. Although the town has been there since before 1720 (the year it was incorporated) and has survived any number of disastrous storms, it is still possible that a major hurricane, if it hit head-on, would simply sweep everything away, since Provincetown has no bedrock, no firm purchase of any kind. It is a city of sand, more or less the way Arctic settlements are cities of ice. A visitor in 1808 wrote to friends in England that the sand was "so light that it drifts about the houses...similar to snow in a driving storm. There were no hard surfaces; upon stepping from the houses the foot sinks in the sand." Thoreau noted some forty years later, "The sand is the great enemy here.... There was a schoolhouse filled with sand up to the tops of the desks."<br><br>The sand has, by now, been domesticated, and Provincetown floats on layers of asphalt, pavement, and brick. Still, any house with a garden has had its soil brought in from elsewhere. Some of the older houses produce their offerings of grass and flowers from earth brought over as ballast in the holds of ships in the 1800s--it is soil that originated in Europe, Asia, or South America. On stormy days gusts of sand still blow through the streets.<br><br><i>"There could be no other town like it. If you were sensitive to crowds, you might expire in summer from human propinquity. On the other hand, if you were unable to endure loneliness, the vessel of your person could fill with dread during the long winter. Martha's Vineyard, not fifty miles to the south and west, had lived through the upsurge of mountains and their erosion, through the rise and fall of oceans, the life and death of great forests and swamps. Dinosaurs had passed over Martha's Vineyard, and their bones were compacted into the bedrock. Glaciers had come and gone, sucking the island to the north, pushing it like a ferry to the south again. Martha's Vineyard had fossil deposits one million centuries old. The northern reach of Cape Cod, however, on which my house sat, the land I inhabited--that long curving spit of shrub and dune that curves in upon itself in a spiral at the tip of the Cape--had only been formed by wind and sea over the last ten thousand years. That cannot amount to more than a night of geological time.<br><br>"Perhaps this is why Provincetown is so beautiful. Conceived at night (for one would swear it was created in the course of one dark storm) its sand flats still glistened in the dawn with the moist primeval innocence of land exposing itself to the sun for the first time. Decade after decade, artists came to paint the light of Provincetown, and comparisons were made to the lagoons of Venice and the marshes of Holland, but then the summer ended and most of the painters left, and the long dingy undergarment of the gray New England winter, gray as the spirit of my mood, came down to visit. One remembered then that the land was only ten thousand years old, and one's ghosts had no roots. We did not have old Martha's Vineyard's fossil remains to subdue each spirit, no, there was nothing to domicile our specters who careened with the wind down the two long streets of our town which curved together around the bay like two spinsters on their promenade to church."</i> --Norman Mailer, from <i>Tough Guys Don't Dance</i><br><br>THE SEASONS<br><br>In high summer, Provincetown's tourist population is incalculable. In winter it shrinks to just more than 3,800 souls. I find it spectacular in all weathers, but for people looking for a conventional week or two at the beach, it is reliably sunny only in July, August, and early September, and even then days or weeks of rain can blow in from the Atlantic. In summer the days are warm and occasionally hot, the nights almost always cool. In winter it usually snows. Because the town is surrounded by ocean, it never gets as bone-chillingly cold as it does in Boston, twenty-seven miles across the bay.<br><br>I grew up in southern California, where the fact that January closely resembles June is generally reckoned a good thing, and a part of my coming of age seems to have involved the development of a low-grade horror of mild weather that pleasantly duplicates itself day after day after day. Provincetown satisfies my appetite for volatility. A curtain of cold rain may sweep through the middle of a sunny summer afternoon, leaving a cooler, clearer version of the same sunshine in its wake. In February a few days of brilliant clarity and relative warmth are not unknown. There are, according to my own private record-keeping, two annual periods of equipoise. There is deep winter, during which a great Arctic curve of frigid quiet obtains. The sky goes as brightly, blankly white as the screen of the drive-in movie theater in Wellfleet. The town is immersed in a low incandescence, as if the light fell not only down from the sky but up from the brown and gray earth as well--from the winter lawns and the silent facades of houses, from the bare branches of trees and the blue-gray bay and the dull pewter of the streets. The air is utterly still; colors are almost violently bright. We who are there then tend to walk the streets carefully, respectfully, as if we feared waking someone. To whatever extent beauty resides in permanence, this is Provincetown at its most beautiful--it seems, in its winter slumber, to be revealed in its actual state, without its jewelry or feathers, like a white marble queen; a woman who, in life, may have been irritable and erratic, prone to sulks, too easily cheered by velvets and brocades; now asleep forever in a cathedral close, her eyes peacefully shut, her face arranged in...</p><h2>Summer of the Sea Serpent (Magic Tree House, No. 31)</h2><p>Jack and Annie are off on another mythical mission at the request of Merlin the magician.

I knew right away it was from the time my mother spent as a Red Cross worker in the Pacific during World War II. Carefully, I extracted a number of thin, yellowing pages with typewritten entries on both sides, and about thirty pictures, in black and white. As I read my mother's words, her familiar voice resonating once again, and as I saw my mother's youthful image, the cheerful smile she wore in every picture ever taken of her glowing still, I felt like an archaeologist, unearthing a precious past. And then, under another pile of papers, inside four shoeboxes labeled "1940s," I found hundreds of letters my mother had written home to her parents in Oklahoma during World War II. My grandmother had lovingly saved every one of them. I was becoming a prospector, discovering gold.</p><p>I already knew a lot of the details of her war years. In August 1942, eight months after the attack on Pearl Harbor and America's entry into World </p><p>War II, my mother, Carol Lynn Gilmer, had married Tom Heggen, a promising writer and an editor at Reader's Digest. She had just finished her bachelor's degree in history and master's degree in journalism at Northwestern University. After he joined the Navy, my mother was one of a couple of women hired in editorial jobs at Reader's Digest in New York to replace the men, like her new husband, leaving for war. In 1945, the last year of the war, she quit her job, joined the Red Cross, and was sent to Saipan. Right around that time, Tom Heggen began sending chapters to her of a novel he was writing while serving aboard his Navy cargo ship in the Pacific. When the war ended, my mother did not go back to her editorial work right away, but instead tried unsuccessfully to devote herself to being a full-time wife. After only a few months, in spring of 1946, she and Tom Heggen were divorced. Months later, the novel he had written, Mr. Roberts, was published. It centered around the crew of a supply boat in the Pacific, like the one on which he served, and the book's dedication read, "For Carol Lynn."</p><p>It went on to become a best-seller. The stage version won the 1948 Tony Award for best play. In 1955, the film version of Mr. Roberts, starring Henry Fonda, James Cagney, and Jack Lemmon, was nominated for best picture and won a best supporting actor Academy Award for Jack Lemmon. But in 1949, Tom Heggen was found dead, drowned in the bathtub of the New York apartment he was sharing at the time with writer Dorothy Parker's ex-husband, Alan Campbell. He had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.</p><p>Mom had talked to me about the pain of that marriage and her divorce and his death. But the happy ending was always that she moved on, met and married David Yellin, my father, her true love, a few years later, gave birth to my three older brothers and me, and continued a long editorial career at Reader's Digest. I had not asked much else about her time during the war. It never came up. Like most of us, I had mostly known the war through my father's stories of serving in the Army in Burma, not my mother's story.</p><p>Suddenly, sitting there on the attic floor, I was beginning to realize there were more dimensions in my mother's wartime experience than I knew. I saw that it had been a transforming time for her, a time when she first came into her own, exerted her courage and took advantage of new opportunities for herself, as a woman. In these letters and pictures, and her diary, I began to see the war through a new lens, a female perspective. It was an unfamiliar but intriguing view.</p><p>I found it in letters like the one to her parents dated January 4, 1945, in which my mother, then twenty-three, tried to explain her decision to leave Reader's Digest and join the Red Cross.</p><p></p><blockquote>Hope you can see how the Digest life is almost too perfect, with the world in the sorry mess it's in....I just have to get out and try to do something active and direct when so many other people are doing so much. It's not enough for me to say that my husband is doing it -- and that's my part in the war. I want to do something myself. Do you see what I mean?</blockquote><p>My grandparents did understand and wrote back supporting her move. But in her grappling with that decision, I was learning what a huge step joining the Red Cross had been for her. In her next letter I also recognized a younger version of the woman I remember, who organized Equal Rights Amendment rallies in the 1970s and 1980s. The letter, dated January 8, 1945, showed prevailing attitudes about women and being a wife that my mother and many other women faced down during the war.</p><p></p><blockquote>You see, when I decided to do this, I anticipated that lots of people would think I was doing a pretty foolish thing. I'm finding that lots of people who don't know the facts of the case think just that. Julie's husband Ken for example, who's one of these people who think that the only reason any girl joins the WACs, WAVES or Red Cross or any other such thing is just to have a wonderful time and meet lots of men. He thinks that I must be a pretty unstable sort of war wife who doesn't keep the home fires burning.<p>...And I expect that many other people, when I announce the decision more publicly will have the same reaction. But...I'm prepared for it. I don't expect everyone to heartily approve of what I'm doing. But now that I know that the people who really matter -- my parents and Tom's parents -- think I'm doing the right thing, I have the moral reinforcement that I really do need. And I'll be able to go ahead with it now with so much greater peace of mind, and really work for what I'm trying to accomplish -- establish a better and broader basis of understanding between Tom and me, while at the same time doing something direct and satisfying in the war effort.</p></blockquote><p>In her diary too, I saw for the first time what it must have been like for a woman in the mostly male world of war. Her good humor about it all is evident in this early excerpt from 1945, when she arrived by boat in Hawaii from Seattle, before being sent to Saipan.</p><p></p><blockquote>April 19 (Thursday)<p>Tonight we went to our first dance overseas -- at an on-post Red Cross club. And we got our first taste of the uneven ratio of men to women in these islands. At this point, the ratio is about 75 to 1 -- not nearly as bad as it used to be when it was 250 to 1. But even so, if you don't bear it constantly in mind you begin to think you're pretty irresistible. The boys are so grateful for small favors that it hurts -- just the fact that you come to their club and dance with them seems to be the finest thing in the world....Many told us it was the first time they'd danced with any girl for more than a year.</p></blockquote><p>And from my mother's writings, I was understanding for the first time what ultimate sacrifices women made for the war. While women were not usually the ones killed in combat, they were the ones who bravely had to endure the news, and keep going after husbands, sons, and brothers were killed.</p><p></p><blockquote>Wednesday, May 2<p>Today I was with Jean Archer when she received a letter telling of her older brother's death in Europe. We were on our way to the hospital to get our yellow fever shots. Jean had just picked up her mail at headquarters. The first letters she opened were from neighbors back home -- letters of sympathy....He was more than an ordinarily favorite brother. I'd heard her speak of him so often and had read some of his letters approving of her joining Red Cross. She was very composed about it -- didn't even break down and cry until she was going through the rest of her mail and found a letter from her brother himself -- written only a few days before he was killed.</p></blockquote><p>When I read another entry in my mother's diary from 1945, after she had arrived in Saipan, I saw the modest, initial stirrings that led to her support of the civil rights movement living in Memphis during the 1960s. Though Americans were fighting injustice abroad, segregation was encoded in the U.S. Army in 1945, just as it was encoded in the Jim Crow laws of the American South at that time. And its inextricable partner, racism, was prevalent among many Americans then too.</p><p></p><blockquote>Thursday, May 31<p>Today I went on my first clubmobile run. Taking coffee and doughnuts to the ground crews as they serviced the B-29s....We then began stopping and serving various working groups, engineers and warehouse workers, road construction gangs, etc. One interesting experience was serving Negro soldiers. I'm sure that for most of them it was the first time they'd been served by Red Cross girls. Most of them had to be invited several times before they realized we wanted to give them refreshments. One of them said, "The good Lord must have sent you, ma'am." Another group said "Well, that's the first time I ever believed it about Red Cross being at your side, yes sir." Both Jean Quirk, the other girl I was working with, and I were very glad we'd stopped. And we almost didn't because we had quite an argument with our driver (an Indian boy from Oklahoma, incidentally) before we convinced him that we wouldn't be raped or murdered on the spot if we stopped to serve Negroes.</p></blockquote><p>Among her letters I also found a few that my mom's former mother-in-law, Mina Heggen, Tom's mother, had written to my grandmother. Particularly telling was one letter, written in April 1950, in which mom's former mother-in-law talked about Tom's death, his marriage to my mother, and the war. Reading it, I found not only more insight into my mother's life, but also the pain of another mother who, although belatedly, felt she somehow had lost her son to the war as well.</p><p></p><blockquote>I remember him [Tom] calling up right after they had separated and saying how badly he felt about it all. He said it was al...</blockquote></p><h2>The Spiritual Dimension of the Enneagram: Nine Faces of the Soul</h2><p>The spirituality of the enneagram is revealed in this fascinating study of the personality profiling tool that is designed to measure the &#34;essence&#34; within each person. 15,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Sandra Maitri</b> was a member of the first group of students to whom the Chilean psychiatrist Claudio Naranjo presented the enneagram system in the U.S. almost three decades ago. Throughout her many years of studying and teaching it, Maitri has preserved the legacy of this original transmission. In addition to her work with Naranjo, she has studied with various Eastern and Western spiritual and psychological teachers, including A.H. Almaas, founder of the contemporary spiritual path, the Diamond Approach. As one of the principal and supervising teachers of the Diamond Approach, she teaches the enneagram as part of the larger work of personal transformation, working with hundreds of students each year in the U.S. and Europe. She lives in Marin County, California."I learned and worked with the knowledge of the enneagram in the same group as Sandra Maitri, led by Claudio Naranjo. The enneagram knowledge that this group worked with became the source of all enneagram books, except those of Oscar Ichazo, from whom Naranjo received that knowledge. We spent several years intensely and experientially working with this useful material within the context of inner spiritual transformation, resulting in an experience and depth of comprehension of it that I find preserved in Maitri's book. Her careful study of the enneagram types also reflects her continued experience in teaching it for many years, just as it embodies her mature understanding of spiritual transformation. Sandra is not only a teacher of the enneagram; she is first and foremost an experienced and fine teacher of inner spiritual transformation. Her book possesses a depth and completeness that I find missing in the existing enneagram literature." -- <i>A.H. Almaas, founder and director of the Ridhwan School and author of books including THE ELIXIR OF ENLIGHTENMENT, THE VOID, THE PEARL BEYOND PRICE, and THE POINT OF EXISTENCE</i><br><br>"In both her writing and teaching, Sandra Maitri has a brilliant capacity to explain esoteric, baffling concepts in a thoroughly relevant and thrilling manner. It is a privilege for me to have been counted as one of her students." -- <i>Geneen Roth, author of FEEDING THE HUNGRY HEART and WHEN FOOD IS LOVE</i><br><br>"Sandra Maitri is a cartographer of consciousness. The maps she plots are based on the enneagram, an ancient system of understanding human personality. And the destinations, the high roads of these maps, are what we all long for in our hearts -- freedom from the prison of repeating the old patterns, freedom to enter new territory. I highly recommend this book to anyone in search of a master cartographer to show the way through the narrows to ten thousand miles of clear sailing." -- <i>Sherry Ruth Anderson, Ph.D. co-author, THE FEMININE FACE OF GOD and THE CULTURAL CREATIVES, former Chair of Psychological Research, Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, Canada</i></p><h2>The Thicket</h2><p><b>*Soon to be a major motion picture starring Peter Dinklage*</b><b><br></b> <b>ALA Reading List Award for History, Short List</b><b><b><br></b>Love and vengeance at the dark dawn of the East Texas oil boom from Joe Lansdale, "a true American original" (Joe Hill, author of <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i>).</b><br><br>Jack Parker thought he'd already seen his fair share of tragedy.

Lansdale is the author of more than a dozen novels, including <em>Edge of Dark Water</em>, the Edgar Award-winning <i>The Bottoms,</i><i> </i> <i>Sunset and Sawdust</i>, and <i>Leather Maiden</i>.<i> </i>He has received nine Bram Stoker Awards, the American Mystery Award, the British Fantasy Award, the Grinzane Cavour Prize for Literature. He lives with his family in Nacogdoches, Texas." Hellish and hilarious . . . It's classic Lansdale, his own self peppered throughout by much piney backwoods philosophizing on everything from religion to whoring, [with] the author's long-ago trademarked heaping helping of wry, often delightfully vulgar humanism. <i>The Thicket</i> is a keeper and then some." --<i>Austin Chronicle</i><br><br>"This latest work reads like a dark version of <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em> and feels like a Coen brothers movie. It's the perfect mix of light and dark, with plenty of humor mixed in." --<i>Houston Chronicle</i><br><br>"Lansdale excels at giving his fans what they want...Many die, but what's really dying here, Lansdale says, is a romanticized way of life." --<i>Dallas Morning News</i><br><br>"About a perfect a Western as you'll find . . . Let's say you planned to write a story set in 1916 in Texas. Borrow a little from <i>The Wizard of Oz,</i> a little Mark Twain, and make a nod toward classic western literature.

Now, contemplating retirement after years on the job, Tully is faced with perhaps his most perplexing case yet. When area bald eagles start getting picked off by a ghost-like killer, and when a prominent local rancher is murdered by an arrow with eagle fletching, things gets complicated fast. In this fast-paced whodunit, Tully has a vast array of suspects to chose from including the rancher&#x2019;s gorgeous, bird-loving wife who mysteriously leaves for a ranch in Mexico the day of the murder; the beautiful chef at the local house of ill repute, who is well-known as a budding ornithologist; and the ranch foreman, who is rumored to be having an affair with his boss&#x2019;s widow.<br>Will Tully put the pieces of the puzzle together, yet again? Will sending his dad, the former sheriff of Blight County, along with his number two man, down to Mexico help solve the mystery? And what about the mysterious large circles in the snow that Tully finds around the ranch with no footprints leading in or out of the area?<br><br>It all adds up to another engrossing series of twists and turns. And in the end, Tully gets his man . . . or woman . . . or does he?<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade, Yucca, and Good Books imprints, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in fiction novels, novellas, political and medical thrillers, comedy, satire, historical fiction, romance, erotic and love stories, mystery, classic literature, folklore and mythology, literary classics including Shakespeare, Dumas, Wilde, Cather, and much more.

McManus is a humor writer who began writing as an undergrad at Washington State University. Hundreds of his humor articles have been published in magazines such as Field &amp; Stream and Outdoor Life. He has published more than a dozen humor books, several mysteries, and a children&#x2019;s humor book. Among his recent works are The Tamarack Murders, The Horse in My Garage, Kerplunk!, and The Huckleberry Murders.It&#x2019;s a lot for a guy thinking about retirement to deal with all at once: someone&#x2019;s been killing bald eagles; a widely disliked rancher has been murdered (with an arrow, no less); and mysterious circles, perfectly round, are appearing in the snow. Blight County, Idaho, Sheriff Bo Tully juggles a handful of likely murder suspects with his usual wit and aplomb, while handling his cantankerous, ex-sheriff father with rather less finesse. McManus, who&#x2019;s a humor columnist and nonfiction writer when he&#x2019;s not writing the Tully novels, has a real gift for dialogue and character; the humor in this delightful series comes out of the characters and the situations, not from clever wordplay or comedy set pieces. And it&#x2019;s worth mentioning, for those readers who haven&#x2019;t yet read a Tully novel (this is the sixth), that the mysteries are well crafted and genuinely suspenseful, not merely an excuse for some lighthearted goings-on, but solid puzzlers in their own right. Warning to McManus: you&#x2019;d better not let Bo retire anytime soon. --David Pitt</p><h2>A Taste for Death (Modesty Blaise series)</h2><p>The rugged team of Modesty Blaise and her loyal lieutenant, Willie Garvin, take on impossible odds as&nbsp;they&nbsp;battle Simon Delicta, a man with a taste for death, and&nbsp;Swordmaster Wenczel in a duel to the death.

There, Merlin the Magician tells them that the Stone of Destiny has been stolen. The answer to its disappearance lies within a haunted castle.

With the help of their old pal Teddy (Morgan le Fay's apprentice, last seen in dog form in four earlier Tree House stories), the two "Master Librarians and Magicians of Everyday Magic" must solve the mystery behind a castle full of ghosts and a menacing army of ravens. Not surprisingly, half the trouble comes in unraveling Merlin's riddles and helping Teddy use his rhyming magic correctly.</p><p> </p><p> Osborne doesn't challenge readers overmuch (including the constant restatement of plot elements, perhaps worried that kids might otherwise forget or lose interest) and many parts of the story barely convince (like Teddy's "period" dialogue, e.g., "'Tis cool indeed"), but fans of the Magic Tree House will no doubt love another installment.

In short, lively chapters Ackroyd writes about connections between the Thames and such historical figures as Julius Caesar and Henry the VIII, and offers memorable portraits of the ordinary men and women who depend upon the river for their livelihoods. He visits all the towns and villages along the river from Oxfordshire to London and describes the magnificent royal residences, as well as the bridges and docks, locks and weirs, found along its 215-mile run. The Thames as a source of artistic inspiration comes brilliantly to life as Ackroyd invokes Chaucer, Shakespeare, Turner, Shelley, and other writers, poets, and painters who have been enchanted by its many moods and colors. <br><br>In his signature entertaining and informative manner, Ackroyd allows the reader to dip into chapters in his own spirit, or to follow the Thames from source to sea. <br>Illustrated with maps and photographs, THAMES is a vivid, highly original mosaic of life by and on the water.</p></p><p><p>PETER ACKROYD is the author of <i>London: The Biography</i>, <i>Albion: The Origins of the English Imagination</i>, and <i>Shakespeare: The Biography</i>; acclaimed biographies of T.S. Eliot, Dickens, Blake, and Sir Thomas More; thirteen novels; and the series Ackroyd&#x2019;s Brief Lives.

He lives in London.</p>CHAPTER I<br>The River as Fact<br>It has a length of 215 miles, and is navigable for 191 miles. It is the longest river in England but not in Britain, where the Severn is longer by approximately 5 miles. Nevertheless it must be the shortest river in the world to acquire such a famous history. The Amazon and the Mississippi cover almost 4,000 miles, and the Yangtze almost 3,500 miles; but none of them has arrested the attention of the world in the manner of the Thames.<br><br>It runs along the borders of nine English counties, thus reaffirming its identity as a boundary and as a defence. It divides Wiltshire from Gloucestershire, and Oxfordshire from Berkshire; as it pursues its way it divides Surrey from Middlesex (or Greater London as it is inelegantly known) and Kent from Essex. It is also a border of Buckinghamshire. It guarded these once tribal lands in the distant past, and will preserve them into the imaginable future.<br><br>There are 134 bridges along the length of the Thames, and forty-four locks above Teddington. There are approximately twenty major tributaries still flowing into the main river, while others such as the Fleet have now disappeared under the ground. Its "basin," the area from which it derives its water from rain and other natural forces, covers an area of some 5,264 square miles. And then there are the springs, many of them in the woods or close to the streams beside the Thames. There is one in the wood below Sinodun Hills in Oxfordshire, for example, which has been described as an "everlasting spring" always fresh and always renewed.<br><br>The average flow of the river at Teddington, chosen because it marks the place where the tidal and non-tidal waters touch, has been calculated at 1,145 millions of gallons (5,205 millions of litres) each day or approximately 2,000 cubic feet (56.6 cubic metres) per second. The current moves at a velocity between 1�2 and 23�4 miles per hour. The main thrust of the river flow is known to hydrologists as the "thalweg"; it does not move in a straight and forward line but, mingling with the inner flow and the variegated flow of the surface and bottom waters, takes the form of a spiral or helix. More than 95 per cent of the river's energy is lost in turbulence and friction.<br><br>The direction of the flow of the Thames is therefore quixotic. It might be assumed that it would move eastwards, but it defies any simple prediction. It flows north-west above Henley and at Teddington, west above Abingdon, south from Cookham and north above Marlow and Kingston. This has to do with the variegated curves of the river. It does not meander like the Euphrates, where according to Herodotus the voyager came upon the same village three times on three separate days, but it is circuitous. It specialises in loops. It will take the riparian traveller two or three times as long to cover the same distance as a companion on the high road. So the Thames teaches you to take time, and to view the world from a different vantage.<br><br>The average "fall" or decline of the river from its beginning to its end is approximately 17 to 21 inches (432 to 533 mm) per mile. It follows gravity, and seeks out perpetually the simplest way to the sea. It falls some 600 feet (183 m) from source to sea, with a relatively precipitous decline of 300 feet (91.5 m) in the first 9 miles; it falls 100 (30.4 m) more in the next 11 miles, with a lower average for the rest of its course. Yet averages may not be so important. They mask the changeability and idiosyncrasy of the Thames. The mean width of the river is given as 1,000 feet (305 m), and a mean depth of 30 feet (9 m); but the width varies from 1 or 2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 m) at Trewsbury to 51�2 miles at the Nore.<br><br>The tide, in the words of Tennyson, is that which "moving seems asleep, too full for sound and foam." On its flood inward it can promise benefit or danger; on its ebb seaward it suggests separation or adventure. It is one general movement but it comprises a thousand different streams and eddies; there are opposing streams, and high water is not necessarily the same thing as high tide. The water will sometimes begin to fall before the tide is over. The average speed of the tide lies between 1 and 3 knots (1.15 and 3.45 miles per hour), but at times of very high flow it can reach 7 knots (8 miles per hour). At London Bridge the flood tide runs for almost six hours, while the ebb tide endures for six hours and thirty minutes. The tides are much higher now than at other times in the history of the Thames. There can now be a difference of some 24 feet (7.3 m) between high and low tides, although the average rise in the area of London Bridge is between 15 and 22 feet (4.5 and 6.7 m). In the period of the Roman occupation, it was a little over 3 feet (0.9 m). The high tide, in other words, has risen greatly over a period of two thousand years.<br><br>The reason is simple. The south-east of England is sinking slowly into the water at the rate of approximately 12 inches (305 mm) per century. In 4000 BC the land beside the Thames was 46 feet (14 m) higher than it is now, and in 3000 BC it was some 31 feet (9.4 m) higher. When this is combined with the water issuing from the dissolution of the polar ice-caps, the tides moving up the lower reaches of the Thames are increasing at a rate of 2 feet (0.6 m) per century. That is why the recently erected Thames Barrier will not provide protection enough, and another barrier is being proposed.<br><br>The tide of course changes in relation to the alignment of earth, moon and sun. Every two weeks the high "spring" tides reach their maximum two days after a full moon, while the low "neap" tides occur at the time of the half-moon. The highest tides occur at the times of equinox; this is the period of maximum danger for those who live and work by the river. The spring tides of late autumn and early spring are also hazardous. It is no wonder that the earliest people by the Thames venerated and propitiated the river.<br><br>The general riverscape of the Thames is varied without being in any sense spectacular, the paraphernalia of life ancient and modern clustering around its banks. It is in large part now a domesticated river, having been tamed and controlled by many generations. It is in that sense a piece of artifice, with some of its landscape deliberately planned to blend with the course of the water. It would be possible to write the history of the Thames as a history of a work of art.<br><br>It is a work still in slow progress. The Thames has taken the same course for ten thousand years, after it had been nudged southward by the glaciation of the last ice age. The British and Roman earthworks by the Sinodun Hills still border the river, as they did two thousand years before. Given the destructive power of the moving waters, this is a remarkable fact. Its level has varied over the millennia--there is a sudden and unexpected rise at the time of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, for example--and the discovery of submerged forests testifies to incidents of overwhelming flood. Its appearance has of course also altered, having only recently taken the form of a relatively deep and narrow channel, but its persistence and identity through time are an aspect of its power.<br><br>Yet of course every stretch has its own character and atmosphere, and every zone has its own history. Out of oppositions comes energy, out of contrasts beauty. There is the overwhelming difference of water within it, varying from the pure freshwater of the source through the brackish zone of estuarial water to the salty water in proximity to the sea. Given the eddies of the current, in fact, there is rather more salt by the Essex shore than by the Kentish shore. There are manifest differences between the riverine landscapes of Lechlade and of Battersea, of Henley and of Gravesend; the upriver calm is in marked contrast to the turbulence of the long stretches known as River of London and then London River. After New Bridge the river becomes wider and deeper, in anticipation of its change.<br><br>The rural landscape itself changes from flat to wooded in rapid succession, and there is a great alteration in the nature of the river from the cultivated fields of Dorchester to the thick woods of Cliveden. From Godstow the river becomes a place of recreation, breezy and jaunty with the skiffs and the punts, the sports in Port Meadow and the picnic parties on the banks by Binsey. But then by some change of light it becomes dark green, surrounded by vegetation like a jungle river; and then the traveller begins to see the dwellings of Oxford, and the river changes again. Oxford is a pivotal point. From there you can look upward and consider the quiet source; or you can look downstream and contemplate the coming immensity of London.<br><br>In the reaches before Lechlade the water makes its way through isolated pastures; at Wapping and Rotherhithe the dwellings seem to drop into it, as if overwhelmed by numbers. The elements of rusticity and urbanity are nourished equally by the Thames. That is why parts of the river induce calm and forgetfulness, and others provoke anxiety and despair. It is the river of dreams, but it is also the river of suicide. It has been called liquid history because within itself it dissolves and carries all epochs and generations. They ebb and flow like water.<br>CHAPTER 2<br>The River as Metaphor<br>The river runs through the language, and we speak of its influence in every conceivable context. It is employed to characterise life and death, time and destiny; it is used as a metaphor for continuity and dissolution, for intimacy and transitoriness, for art and history, for poetry itself. In The Principles of Psychology (1890) William James first coined the phrase "stream of consciousness" in which "every definite image of the mind is steeped . . . in the free water that flows around it." Thus "it flows" like the river itself. Yet the river is also a token of the unconscious, with its suggestion of depth and invisible life.<br></p><h2>The Compass of Pleasure: How Our Brains Make Fatty Foods, Orgasm, Exercise, Marijuana, Generosity, Vodka, Learning, and Gambling Feel So Good</h2><p><b>A leading brain scientist's look at the neurobiology of pleasure-and how pleasures can become addictions. </b> <br><br> Whether eating, taking drugs, engaging in sex, or doing good deeds, the pursuit of pleasure is a central drive of the human animal.

The afternoon rains have ended, leaving the early evening air briefly free of smog and allowing that distinctive Thai perfume, frangipani with a faint note of sewage, to waft over the shiny streets. I hail a tuk-tuk, a three-wheel motorcycle taxi, and hop aboard. My young driver has an entrepreneurial smile as he turns around and begins the usual interrogation of male travelers.</p><p>&#x201c;So&nbsp;...you want girl?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d; Long pause, eyebrows slowly raised. &#x201c;You want boy!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh, no.&#x201d;</p><p>Longer pause. Sound of engine sputtering at idle. &#x201c;You want ladyboy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I answer, a bit more emphatically, nonplussed at the idea that I give the impression of desiring this particular commodity.</p><p>&#x201c;I got cheap cigarettes&nbsp;...Johnnie Walker&nbsp;...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>Undaunted, he moves on to the next category of his wares, now with lowered voice.</p><p>&#x201c;You want ganja?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Coke?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ya baa [methamphetamine tablets]?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;</p><p>A whisper now. &#x201c;Heroin?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>Voice raised back to normal. &#x201c;I can take you to cockfight. You can gamble!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pass.&#x201d;</p><p>Just a little bit irritated now. &#x201c;So, farang, what you want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Prik kee noo,&#x201d; I respond. &#x201c;Those little &#x2018;mouse shit&#x2019; peppers. I want some good, spicy dinner.&#x201d; My driver, not surprisingly, is disappointed. As we tear through the streets to a restaurant, blasting through puddles, I&#x2019;m left wondering: Aside from various shades of illegality, what do all his offers have in common? What is it exactly that makes a vice?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We humans have a complicated and ambivalent relationship to pleasure, which we spend an enormous amount of time and resources pursuing. A key motivator of our lives, pleasure is central to learning, for we must find things like food, water, and sex rewarding in order to survive and pass our genetic material to the next generation. Certain forms of pleasure are accorded special status. Many of our most important rituals involving prayer, music, dance, and meditation produce a kind of transcendent pleasure that has become deeply ingrained in human cultural practice.</p><p>As we do with most powerful forces, however, we also want to regulate pleasure. In cultures around the world we find well-defined ideas and rules about pleasure that have persisted throughout history in any number of forms and variations:</p><p></p><p>Pleasure should be sought in moderation.</p><p>Pleasure must be earned.</p><p>Pleasure must be achieved naturally.</p><p>Pleasure is transitory.</p><p>The denial of pleasure can yield spiritual growth.</p><p></p><p>Our legal systems, our religions, our educational systems are all deeply concerned with controlling pleasure. We have created detailed rules and customs surrounding sex, drugs, food, alcohol, and even gambling. Jails are bursting with people who have violated laws that proscribe certain forms of pleasure or who profit by encouraging others to do so.</p><p>One can fashion reasonable theories of human pleasure and its regulation using the methods of cultural anthropology or social history. These are valid and useful endeavors, for ideas and practices involving human pleasure are certainly deeply influenced by&nbsp;culture. However, what I&#x2019;m seeking here in The Compass of Pleasure is a different type of understanding&#x2014;one less nuanced, perhaps, but more fundamental: a cross-cultural biological explanation. In this book I will argue that most experiences in our lives that we find transcendent&#x2014;whether illicit vices or socially sanctioned ritual and social practices as diverse as exercise, meditative prayer, or even charitable giving&#x2014;activate an anatomically and biochemically defined pleasure circuit in the brain. Shopping, orgasm, learning, highly caloric foods, gambling, prayer, dancing &#x2019;til&nbsp;you drop, and playing on the Internet: They all evoke neural signals that converge on a small group of interconnected brain areas called the medial forebrain pleasure circuit. It is in these tiny&nbsp;clumps of neurons that human pleasure is felt. This intrinsic pleasure circuitry can also be co-opted by artificial activators like cocaine or nicotine or heroin or alcohol. Evolution has, in effect, hardwired us to catch a pleasure buzz from a wide variety of experiences from crack to cannabis, from meditation to masturbation, from Bordeaux to beef.</p><p>This theory of pleasure reframes our understanding of the part of the human body that societies are most intent upon regulating. While we might assume that the anatomical region most closely governed by laws, religious prohibitions, and social mores is the genitalia, or the mouth, or the vocal cords, it is actually the medial forebrain pleasure circuit. As societies and as individuals, we are hell-bent on achieving and controlling pleasure, and it is those neurons, deep in our brains, that are the nexus of that struggle.</p><p>These particular neurons also comprise another battleground. The dark side of pleasure is, of course, addiction. It is now becoming clear that addiction is associated with long-lasting changes in the electrical, morphological, and biochemical functions of neurons and synaptic connections within the medial forebrain pleasure circuit. There are strong suggestions that these changes underlie many of the terrifying aspects of addiction, including tolerance (needing successively larger doses to get high), craving, withdrawal, and relapse. Provocatively, such persistent changes appear to be nearly identical to experience-and learning-driven changes in neural circuitry that are used to store memories in other brain regions. In this way, memory, pleasure, and addiction&nbsp;are closely intertwined.</p><p>However, addiction is not the only force responsible for experience-driven changes within the brain&#x2019;s pleasure circuits. The combination of associative learning and pleasure has created nothing less than a cognitive miracle: We can be motivated by pleasure to achieve goals that are entirely arbitrary&#x2014;goals that may or may not have an evolutionary adaptive value. These can be as wide-ranging as reality-based television and curling. For us humans (and probably for other primates and for cetaceans as well), even mere ideas can activate the pleasure circuit. Our eclecticism where pleasure is concerned serves to make our human existence wonderfully rich and complex.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I like to tell the students in my lab that the golden age of brain research is right now, so it&#x2019;s time to get down to business. This sounds like a cheap motivational gimmick, but it&#x2019;s true. Our accumulating understanding of neural function, coupled with enabling technologies that allow us to measure and manipulate the brain with unprecedented precision, has given us new and often counterintuitive insights into behavioral and cognitive phenomena&nbsp; at the levels of biological processes. Nowhere is this more evident than in the neurobiology of pleasure. One example: Do you, like many, think that drug addicts become drug addicts because they derive greater reward from getting high than others? The biology says no: They actually seem to want it more but like it less.</p><p>This level of analysis is not only of academic interest. Understanding the biological basis of pleasure leads us to fundamentally rethink the moral and legal aspects of addiction to drugs, food, sex, and gambling and the industries that manipulate these pleasures in the marketplace. It also calls for a reformation in our concepts of such virtuous and prosocial behaviors as sharing resources, self-deprivation, and the drive for knowledge. Crucially, brain imaging studies show that giving to charity, paying taxes, and receiving information about future events all activate the same neural pleasure circuit that&#x2019;s engaged by heroin or orgasm or fatty foods. Perhaps, most important, analysis of the molecular basis of enduring changes in the brain&#x2019;s pleasure circuitry holds great promise for developing drugs and other therapies to help people break free of addictions of many sorts, to both substances and experiences.</p><p>When I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology in the early 1990s, I was fortunate to work with Sid Udenfriend, a pioneer in the biochemistry of the brain and a real mensch. Sid&#x2019;s favorite pedagogical phrase, usually intoned at the bar, was &#x201c;It&#x2019;s always good to know a little chemistry.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t agree more. It would be possible to write a book exploring the brain&#x2019;s pleasure circuits that was free of not only molecules but also basic anatomy, but that sort of spoon-feeding would require ignoring some of the most interesting and important issues, and so that&#x2019;s not what you&#x2019;ll find here. If you come along for the ride and work with me just a bit to learn some basic neuroscience, I&#x2019;ll do my best to make it lively and fun as we explore the cellular and molecular basis of human pleasure, transcendent experience, and addiction.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>MASHING THE PLEASURE BUTTON</p><p></p><p></p><p>Montr�al, 1953. Fortunately, Peter Milner and James Olds didn&#x2019;t have perfect aim. While postdoctoral fellows at McGill University, under the direction of the renowned psychologist Donald Hebb, Olds and Milner were conducting experiments that involved implanting electrodes deep in the brains of rats. The implanting surgery, conducted while the animals were anesthetized, involved cementing a pair of electrodes half a millimeter apart to their skulls. After a few days of recovery from the surgery, the rats were fine. Long, flexible wires were then attached to the electrodes at one end and to an electrical stimulator at the other, to allow for activation of the specific brain region where the tips of the electrodes had come to rest.</p><p>One fall day Olds and Milner were testing a rat in which they had attempted to target a structure called the midbrain reticular system. Located at the midline of the brain, at the point where its base tapers to form the brain stem, this region had previously been shown by another lab to control sleeping and waking cycles. In this particular surgery, however, the electrodes had gone astray and come to rest still at the midline, but at a somewhat more forward position in the brain, in a region called the septum.</p><p>The rat in question was placed in a large rectangular box with corners labeled A, B, C, and D and was allowed to explore freely. Whenever the rat went to corner A, Olds pressed a button that delivered a brief, mild electrical shock through the implanted electrodes. (Unlike the rest of the body, brain tissue does not have the receptors that allow for pain detection, so such shocks don&#x2019;t produce a painful sensation within the skull.) After a few jolts, the rat kept returning to corner A and finally fell asleep in a different location. The next day, however, the rat seemed even more interested in corner A than the others. Olds and Milner were excited: They believed that they had found a brain region that, when stimulated, provoked general curiosity. However, further experiments on this same rat soon proved that not to be the case. By this time, the rat had acquired a habit of returning often to corner A to be stimulated. The researchers then tried to coax the rat away from corner A by administering a shock every time the rat made a step in the direction of corner B. This worked all too well&#x2014;within five minutes, the rat relocated to corner B. Further investigation revealed that this rat could be directed to any location within the box with well-timed brain shocks&#x2014;brief ones to guide the rat to the target lo...</p></p><h2>Fall into Darkness</h2><p>Anne McFarland is dead, and her best friend, Sharon McKay, stands accused even though no body has been found. Nevertheless, the prosecution is almost certain of victory, and Sharon must prove that her friend committed suicide--and unravel the vengeful scheme of an obsessed teenager.</p><p>Just when you think you have this well-written, expertly crafted mystery all figured out, along comes a startling transition that moves the story in another direction. Sharon McKay, 18, is on trial for murdering her best friend, the wealthy, beautiful Ann Rice. It's established almost immediately, however, that Sharon is innocent. A series of flashbacks seen from Ann's perspective reveals that she blames Sharon for the suicide of Ann's brother, who left a note indicating his unrequited love for Sharon. Seeking retribution, Ann concocts an elaborate scheme to frame her, and coaxes Paul, Ann's shiftless 20-year-old fiance, to help. Through the course of the trial, Sharon's lawyer presents key evidence, which ultimately frees her and incarcerates Paul. But the road doesn't end there, and readers will stay along for a breathless ride until they reach the somewhat quirky conclusion. Significantly more gory than the standard YA offering, this is best directed toward the older range of the age spectrum.

The book explores the subterranean part of every gardener&#x2019;s world, revealing how roots really grow while dispelling myths such as where most gardeners apply water, mulch, and fertilizer or compost. This is the first and only book in print for gardeners with such an extensive number of illustrations of garden and orchard roots. The roots covered are: lawns, prairies, shrubs, vegetables, fruit trees, and native and ornamental trees. Practical tips for how a gardener might use this new information to create more abundant vegetables, better lawns and sturdier trees and shrubs are offered with each of the 70 illustrations. <i>Roots Demystified</i> also describes several ways to garden without turning the soil&#x2014;no-till and surface cultivation&#x2014;a plus for aging baby-boomers.</p></p><p>Robert Kourik has written ten books on a variety of topics including drip irrigation, environmentally-sound homes, edible landscaping, and lavender. His articles have appeared in numerous national publications, including seven in <i>The New York Times</i>. He has received two national awards for the best article of the year from the Garden Writers Association. Kourik has authored or co-authored nine books pertaining to a sustainable home and garden. He lives in Northern California.Kourik's color photos and Massion's art effectively illustrate a text that fulfills the title's promise. The author's advice is sound and practical although the reader may bridle at his tone at times. (Attempting a chatty informality, for example, he orders one to "find a comfortable chair and leaf through the book.") Otherwise, this is a valuable guide to the holistic approach to gardening, which relies on natural fertilizers and avoids chemicals. The author begins with suggestions for designing plots according to environment, space available, personal preferences. (The pictures prove that areas featuring vegetables, herbs, fruit- and nut-bearing trees and other edibles can be beautiful.) Kourik, who frequently appears on TV and lectures nationally, includes recipes that use the wide variety of foods featured here. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Power Struggle: The Hundred-Year War over Electricity</h2><p>This history of America&#39;s electric power industry discusses why the development of nuclear plants suddenly accelerated, why attempts at government regulation have been abandoned, and Wall Street&#39;s relationship to the industry</p><p>Is electric power a true "commodity," and should it remain in the hands of the power industry? A growing number of consumer groups across the nation are redefining power as a "service" that should be managed as a basic resource in a "least-cost" approach. Consumer unrest stems from the overbuilding and overfinancing and questionable business sense surrounding nuclear power plants, but what's in question is the future structure of the industry. Rudolph, a professor of community planning, and Ridley, an investigative journalist, skillfully explore the power industry's 100-year history and politics that have brought us to this point. The book is well researched and documented. Recommended for all readers interested in the economic and environmental stability of our country. Diane M.

For centuries the Western tradition has traced its beginnings back to ancient Israel, but recently some historians and archaeologists have questioned the reality of Israel as it is described in biblical literature. In "Who Were the Early Israelites and Where Did They Come From?" William Dever explores the continuing controversies regarding the true nature of ancient Israel and presents the archaeological evidence for assessing the accuracy of the well-known Bible stories.</p><p>Confronting the range of current scholarly interpretations seriously and dispassionately, Dever rejects both the revisionists who characterize biblical literature as "pious propaganda" and the conservatives who are afraid to even question its factuality. Attempting to break through this impasse, Dever draws on thirty years of archaeological fieldwork in the Near East, amassing a wide range of hard evidence for his own compelling view of the development of Israelite history.</p><p>In his search for the actual circumstances of Israel's emergence in Canaan, Dever reevaluates the Exodus-Conquest traditions in the books of Exodus, Numbers, Joshua, Judges, and 1 &amp; 2 Samuel in the light of well-documented archaeological evidence from the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age. Among this important evidence are some 300 small agricultural villages recently discovered in the heartland of what would later become the biblical nation of Israel. According to Dever, the authentic ancestors of the "Israelite peoples" were most likely Canaanites -- together with some pastoral nomadsand small groups of Semitic slaves escaping from Egypt -- who, through the long cultural and socioeconomic struggles recounted in the book of Judges, managed to forge a new agrarian, communitarian, and monotheistic society.</p><p>Written in an engaging, accessible style and featuring fifty photographs that help bring the archaeological record to life, this book provides an authoritative statement on the origins of ancient Israel and promises to reinvigorate discussion about the historicity of the biblical tradition.</p>William G. Dever is professor of Near Eastern archaeology and anthropology at the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p><h2>The Holy Thief</h2><p>The 19th chronicle of Brother Cadfael. In the chill autumn of 1144, rising flood waters endanger the sacred remains of St. Winifred, the abbey&#39;s most cherished possession. When the bones disappear and a corpse is found, Brother Cadfael needs his prayers answered to catch a killer.</p><p>Ellis Peters is one of the pseudonyms of Edith Pargeter who wrote several books under her own name and also Peter Benedict, Jolyon Carr and John Redfern. She was the recipient of the Crime Writers Association and the Cartier Diamond Dagger Award. She died in 1995.Paul Scofield sounds like a 12th-century monk--learned, formal and out of this world. He brings a very medieval interpretation to Brother Cadfael and the host of priors and abbots. Scofield reads slowly with a rich, melodic tone. The narration complements the story. Cadfael&#39;s voice, refined and resolute, has a beneficent tone. The web of the story may not be easy to follow except for experienced Cadfael fans. Here the monk tries to uncover the reasons for the theft of a holy relic and the murder of a young man. The unfamiliar names, titles and relationships are not for novices. The abridgment moves through the story quickly compounding the puzzle. R.F.W.

My decision to inhabit just 90 square feet arose from some concerns I had about the impact a larger house would have on the environment and because I just do not want to maintain a lot of unused or unusable space. My house meets all of my domestic needs without demanding much in return. The simple, slower lifestyle it affords is a luxury for which I am continually grateful. If smaller, well-designed houses aren&#39;t the wave of the future, they certainly are a significant ripple on that wave. On these pages, I explain why. I also share my personal experiences with living in diminutive homes, meeting codes, and designing small spaces that work.&#34; The book is divided into the following chapters: Confessions of a Claustrophile; A Good Home; Making Space; and Portfolio of Houses.

America&#x2019;s new economic map shows growing differences, not just between people but especially between communities. In this important and persuasive book, U.C. Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti provides a fresh perspective on the tectonic shifts that are reshaping America&#x2019;s labor market&#x2014;from globalization and income inequality to immigration and technological progress&#x2014;and how these shifts are affecting our communities. Drawing on a wealth of stimulating new studies, Moretti uncovers what smart policies may be appropriate to address the social challenges that are arising.<p></p> We&#x2019;re used to thinking of the United States in dichotomous terms: red versus blue, black versus white, haves versus have-nots. But today there are <i>three</i> Americas. At one extreme are the brain hubs&#x2014;cities like San Francisco, Boston, Austin, and Durham&#x2014;with a well-educated labor force and a strong innovation sector. Their workers are among the most productive, creative, and best paid on the planet.

What is the New Geography of Jobs?</p> <p> A. If you look at the economic map of America today, you do not see just one country. You see three increasingly different countries. On one hand there are cities like Seattle, San Francisco, Raleigh-Durham or Austin, with a strong innovation-based economy and workers who are among the most creative and best paid on the planet. At the other extreme are former manufacturing centers like Detroit, Flint or Cleveland, where jobs and salaries are plummeting. In the middle, there is the rest of America, apparently undecided on which direction to take.</p> <p> The difference between the three Americas was small in the 1980&#x2019;s and has been growing ever since. My book explores this new geography of jobs, and especially its root causes and what it means for our country. </p> <p> Q. In the last two years, American manufacturing has been doing very well. Even the car companies are hiring. But you seem pessimistic about the future of American manufacturing. What&#x2019;s so wrong about manufacturing? And what is so special about the innovation sector?</p> <p> A. The last two years have been good years for manufacturing employment. But they are the exception. The previous two years have been terrible. More in general, for the past 30 years, we have been losing an average of 370,000 jobs per year in manufacturing, and not just during recessions. This trend reflects the adoption of new technologies that make production of physical good increasingly automated. For example, for each car produced, GM today needs 70% fewer workers than in 1950. American manufacturing companies produce today more goods than in 1980, but they only need a fraction of the workers. I do not think these trends are likely to change in any significant way. By contrast, the innovation sector is growing, both in terms of jobs and salaries. For example, jobs in the Internet sector have been growing 200 times faster than the rest of the labor market. For all the talk about outsourcing, software is also growing. And it is not just high tech: Scientific R&amp;D, pharmaceutical, digital entertainment, parts of marketing and finance are creating jobs.</p> <p> Q. You write a lot about the importance of high tech and innovation for American jobs. But not everyone can work at Google or Apple. What about the rest of us? Where are the jobs for the average American supposed to come from?</p> <p> A. This is the most important part of the story. You are right: The average American will never work for Google or Apple. But the rise of the high tech sector matters to all of us, including those who work outside high tech. </p> <p> One important reason is that attracting an Internet company or a biotech company to a city results in significant job gains for workers in the local service sector--occupations like waiters, carpenters, doctors and teachers. I call this the multiplier effect. This multiplier effect is surprisingly large. My research shows that for each new high tech job in a city, five additional jobs are created outside high tech in that city. In essence, from the point of view of a city, a high-tech job is much more than a job.</p> <p> Take Apple, for example. It employs 13,000 workers in Cupertino, but it generates almost 70,000 additional service jobs in the region. This means that, remarkably, Apple's main effect is not among high tech workers--it is outside high tech. </p> <p>Most sectors of our economy have a multiplier effect, but the innovation sector has the largest multiplier: about three times larger than that of traditional manufacturing. An important implication for policy makers is that the best way for a city to generate jobs for less skilled workers is to attract innovative companies that hire highly skilled ones.</p> Q. The Great Divergence is an economic phenomenon. Are there any effects outside the realm of economics? <p></p> <p> A. The economic differences between American communities have become so large that they are now generating a growing divide in many other aspects of our lives, including politics, family life and culture. Take health, for example. Health varies enormously across communities. The average man in Fairfax Virginia lives fifteen years longer than the average man in Baltimore, 60 miles away. This difference in health is truly staggering, and it is much larger than the difference between the US as a whole and some poor countries. The difference was smaller in the 1980's and it has been growing for three decades--driven by the growing differences in schooling levels and income levels between the two communities. </p> <p> Q. Which cities will prosper in the future and which will decline?</p> <p>Sixty years ago the rich areas in America were manufacturing centers, with an abundance of physical capital. Today human capital is the best predictor of a city success. A large number of highly educated workers in a city is associated with more creativity and a better ability to invent new ways of working. Economic research shows that cities with many college-educated workers tend to develop an innovation-based economy; and this brings even more well-educated workers there, further reinforcing their edge. It is a tipping point dynamic. By contrast, cities with few well-educated workers miss-out on the growth of high tech, and this further reduces their appeal. These self-reinforcing dynamics magnify the differences between winners and losers in an innovation-driven economy. </p> <p> Q. Is geographical location more important than your college degree or which college major you choose?</p> <p> A. Geographical location is increasingly important, although not as important as going to college. One of the most intriguing paradoxes is that our global economy is becoming increasingly local. Despite all the hype about exploding connectivity and the death of distance, where we live and work is more important than ever. Our best ideas still reflect the daily, unpredictable stimuli that we receive from the people we come across and our immediate social environment. Most of our crucial interactions are still face-to-face, and most of what we learn that is valuable comes from the people we know, not from Wikipedia. The vast majority of the world&#x2019;s phone calls, Web traffic, and investments are still local. Telecommuting is still incredibly rare. Video conferencing, e-mail, and Skype have not made a dent in the need for innovative people to work side by side. In fact, that is more important than ever. At the same time that goods and information travel at faster and faster speeds to all corners of the globe, we are witnessing an inverse gravitational pull toward certain key urban centers. Globalization and localization seem to be two sides of the same coin. More than ever, local communities are the secret of economic success. As Yaniv Bensadon, an Israeli entrepreneur who recently moved his startup to Silicon Valley, put it, "It is true that things can be done anywhere on the Internet, but at the end of the day, it&#x2019;s still a people business."</p>From a rising young economist, an examination of innovation and success, and where to find them in America<br><br>An unprecedented redistribution of American jobs, population, and wealth is under way, and it is likely to accelerate in the years to come. In this important and persuasive book, Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti reveals this &#x201c;new geography of jobs&#x201d; that&#x2019;s benefiting centers of innovation like San Francisco, Boston, Austin, and Durham. And the winners and losers aren&#x2019;t necessarily who you&#x2019;d expect. Moretti&#x2019;s groundbreaking research shows that you don&#x2019;t have to be a scientist or an engineer to thrive in one of these brain hubs.<br><br>Among the beneficiaries are the workers who support the &#x201c;idea-creators&#x201d;&#x2014;the carpenters, hair stylists, personal trainers, lawyers, doctors, and teachers. In fact, Moretti has shown that for every new innovation job in a city, five additional non-innovation jobs are created, and those workers earn higher salaries than their counterparts in other urban areas. It wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be this way. As the global economy shifted from manufacturing to innovation, geography was supposed to matter less. But the pundits were wrong. A new map is being drawn and it&#x2019;s not about red versus blue or rich versus poor. The rise of American brain hubs is causing huge geographic disparities in education, income, life expectancy, family stability, and political engagement.

Personal histories, both complex and simple, unfold in rich detail of circumstance and feeling. <i>Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage</i> provides the deep pleasures and rewards that Alice Munro&#x2019;s large and ever- growing audience has come to expect.</p><p>Readers know what they are going to get when they pick up an unfamiliar Alice Munro collection, and yet almost every page carries a bounty of unexpected action, feeling, language, and detail. Her stories are always unique, blazing an invigorating originality out of her seemingly commonplace subjects. Each collection develops her oeuvre in increments, subtly expanding her range. <p> <i>Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage</i> is, of course, no exception. It is a fairly conservative collection of nine stories, none of which move far beyond Munro's favored settings: the tiny towns and burgeoning cities of southern Ontario and British Columbia. There are glimpses of youth here--in the title story, an epistolary prank by two teenage girls leads to a one-sided cross country elopement and, seemingly, a happy marriage, and in "Nettles," disrupted childhood affection fleetingly returns through a chance meeting--but most of these pieces are stories of aging women and men, confronting the twin travails of death and late love. As is always the case with Munro, their plots are too elegantly elaborate to summarize, and their unsentimental power is a given; baroque praise would be futile. Read these stories--it is the only way to really understand the miracles that Munro so regularly performs. <i>--Jack Illingworth</i></p>&#x201c;Surely Munro&#x2019;s best yet.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The New York Times Book Review<br><br></i>&#x201c;She is the living writer most likely to be read in a hundred years.&#x201d; &#x2013;Mona Simpson, <i>The Atlantic Monthly<br><br></i>&#x201c;One of the foremost practitioners of the art of the short story. . . .

Henry, Dasniell Hammett, Ring Lardner, Ernest Hemingway, Ellery Queen, James Thurber, Sue Grafton, Stephen King, Joyce Carol Oates, Sara Paretsky, John Steinbeck, Mickey Spillane, and many, many others. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>Anthologies are tricky things for editors: to select a story for inclusion is to make oneself a target for readers who wonder hotly why X or Y or Z <i>wasn't</i> chosen. And to be so brash as to deem an anthology the best <i>anything</i> of the century practically invites scorn and condemnation. But with <i>The Best American Mystery Stories of the Century</i>, Tony Hillerman, Edgar-winning author, and Otto Penzler, founder of the Mysterious Press, step boldly to the firing line with a salvo of 55 stories that are so devious and absorbing, challenging and rewarding that most readers will hold their fire.<p> The collection stretches from O. Henry's 1903 tale of a bank robber who abandons his trade ("A Retrieved Reformation") to Dennis Lehane's unsettling sketch of a post-Gothic southern town and its canine conundrum ("Running Out of Dog," 1999), and brings together authors who at first seem uneasy bedfellows. William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway jostle for space with Donald Westlake and Stephen Greenleaf; Willa Cather and Flannery O'Conner stare combatively at Sara Paretsky and Sue Grafton. But as one reads along, these potentially tense alliances relax: the boundaries between "modern" and "classic," "pulp" and "literature" evanesce, leaving instead a shimmering web of serendipitous affiliations: O. Henry and Stephen King nod amiably to one another, united by the skill of their devious narrative twists. </p><p> Hillerman and Penzler's selections reflect a century-long shift in mystery fiction from an emphasis on an exterior landscape--replete with the tangible artifacts of who, what, where, when, how, why--to a growing interest in the geography of interiority. This landscape thrives on the amorphousness of its own features. In Tom Franklin's "Poachers," for example, the puzzle hardly matters at all: real people, and their endlessly convoluted relationships, do. Three orphaned brothers who live as predators in the swamps of the Gulf Coast, the old widower who loves them, the sheriff who pities them all--who kills two of the boys and blinds a third? We never really know. In any case, Franklin's infinitely shaded nuances of silence and speech matter far more than the violence of the crime itself.</p><p> And for those readers who, when all is read and done, still insist that <i>they</i> could have done a much better job of judging, Penzler's disarming editorial shrug serves to remind that any anthology should be approached with equanimity, a touch of resignation, and not a little humor: "There are no scientific instruments that can tell a reader which of Harlan Ellison's two Edgar-winning short stories is better. It is a coin toss, and it can't be anything else. Let's just live with it." Happily, <i>The Best American Mystery Stories of the Century</i> is an extraordinarily rewarding companion. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>In <i>The Best American Mystery Stories of the Century</i>, best-selling author Tony Hillerman and mystery expert Otto Penzler present an unparalleled treasury of American suspense fiction that every fan will cherish. Offering the finest examples from all reaches of the genre, this collection charts the mystery's eminent history from the turn-of-the-century puzzles of Futrelle, to the seminal pulp fiction of Hammett and Chandler, to the mystery story's rise to legitimacy in the popular mind, a trend that has benefited masterly writers like Westlake, Hunter, and Grafton. Nowhere else can readers find a more thorough, more engaging, more essential distillation of American crime fiction. <p>Penzler, the <i>Best American Mystery Stories</i> series editor, and Hillerman winnowed this select group out of a thousand stories, drawing on sources as diverse as <i>Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine</i> and <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Collier's</i> and <i>The New Yorker</i>. Giants of the genre abound &#x2013; Raymond Chandler, Stephen King, Dashiell Hammett, Lawrence Block, Ellery Queen, Sara Paretsky, and others &#x2013; but the editors also unearthed gems by luminaries rarely found in suspense anthologies: William Faulkner, John Steinbeck, Damon Runyon, Harlan Ellison, James Thurber, and Joyce Carol Oates. Mystery buffs and newcomers alike will delight in the thrilling stories and top-notch writing of a hundred years' worth of the finest suspense, crime, and mystery writing.</p></p><h2>Tombland</h2><p>Review: Tudor England of 1549 is effortlessly evoked.

Sansom heads to Norwich, as Shardlake embarks upon a new investigation... From the Inside Flap: Spring, 1549. Two years after the death of Henry VIII, England is sliding into chaos... The nominal king, Edward VI, is eleven years old. His uncle Edward Seymour, Lord Hertford, rules as Protector. The extirpation of the old religion by radical Protestants is stirring discontent among the populace while the Protector&#39;s prolonged war with Scotland is proving a disastrous failure and threatens to involve France. Worst of all, the economy is in collapse, inflation rages and rebellion is stirring among the peasantry. Since the old King&#39;s death, Matthew Shardlake has been working as a lawyer in the service of Henry&#39;s younger daughter, the Lady Elizabeth. The gruesome murder of Edith Boleyn, the wife of John Boleyn - a distant Norfolk relation of Elizabeth&#39;s mother - which could have political implications for Elizabeth, brings Shardlake and his assistant Nicholas Overton to the summer assizes at Norwich. There they are reunited with Shardlake&#39;s former assistant Jack Barak. The three find layers of mystery and danger surrounding Edith&#39;s death, as a second murder is committed. And then East Anglia explodes, as peasant rebellion breaks out across the country. The yeoman Robert Kett leads a force of thousands in overthrowing the landlords and establishing a vast camp outside Norwich. Soon the rebels have taken over the city, England&#39;s second largest. Barak throws in his lot with the rebels; Nicholas, opposed to them, becomes a prisoner in Norwich Castle; while Shardlake has to decide where his ultimate loyalties lie, as government forces in London prepare to march north and destroy the rebels. Meanwhile he discovers that the murder of Edith Boleyn may have connections reaching into both the heart of the rebel camp and of the Norfolk gentry... From the Back Cover: PRAISE FOR C. J.

His techniques have spawned countless imitators, most of whom pay lip service to the buzzword "contrarian," but few can match his performance. His Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund has been the leader since its inception in 1988 -- the number one equity-income fund among all 208 ranked by Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. Dreman is also one of a handful of money managers whose clients have beaten the runaway market over the past five, ten, and fifteen years. <br> Now, as the longest bull market in the history of the stock market winds down, there is increasing volatility and a great deal of uncertainty. This is the climate that tests the mettle of the pros, the worries of the average investor, and the success of David Dreman's brilliant new strategies for the next millennium. <br> <i>Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation</i> shows investors how to outperform professional money managers and profit from potential Wall Street panics -- all in Dreman's trademark style, which <i>The New York Times</i> calls "witty and clear as a silver bell." Dreman reveals a proven, systematic, and safe way to beat the market by buying stocks of good companies when they are currently out of favor. At the heart of his book is a fundamental psychological insight: investors overreact. Dreman demonstrates how investors consistently overvalue the so-called "best" stocks and undervalue the so-called "worst" stocks, and how earnings and other surprises affect the best and worst stocks in opposite ways. Since surprises are a way of life in the market, Dreman shows you how to profit from these surprises with his ingenious new techniques, most of which have been developed in the nineties. You'll learn: <br> <ul> <li>Why contrarian stocks offer extra protection in bear markets, as well as delivering superior returns when the bull roars. </li><li>Why a high dividend yield is just as important for the aggressive investor as it is for "widows and orphans." </li><li>Why owning Treasury bills and government bonds -- the "safest investments" for centuries -- is like being fully margined at the top of the 1929 market. </li><li>Why Initial Public Offerings are a guaranteed loser's game. </li><li>Why you should avoid Nasdaq ("the market of the next hundred years") like the plague. </li><li>Why crisis, panic, and even market downturns are the contrarian investor's best friend. </li><li>Why the chances of hitting a home run using the Street's best research are worse than being the big winner in the New York State Lottery. </li></ul> <br> Based on cutting-edge research and irrefutable statistics, David Dreman's revolutionary techniques will benefit professionals and laymen alike.</p><p>All stock-market investors embrace the motto "Buy low, sell high." Few act accordingly, however, for to do so would require that we go against the crowd, buying stocks that are out of favor and selling Wall Street's darlings. Powerful psychological forces prevent us from pursuing a contrarian investment strategy, although it consistently beats the market, according to David Dreman, a seasoned money manager and long-time columnist for <i>Forbes</i> magazine. One of the Street's best-known and most articulate contrarians, Dreman has updated his 1982 investment classic, <i>Contrarian Investment Strategies</i>, using recent research on investor psychology. His revised book combines proven techniques for selecting undervalued stocks with fresh insights on how to defy, and thereby profit from, the popular fears or enthusiasms of the moment. <p> Dreman pays only cursory attention to a company's business fundamentals in deciding whether to invest in it. Instead he looks for stocks trading at below-market multiples of per-share earnings, cash flow, book value, or dividend yield. Historically, Dreman claims, stocks that are cheap by any of these measures have tended to outperform the market average, although this is disputed by those who believe the stock market is efficient and therefore impossible to beat except by accident. Dreman devotes many pages to debunking their research. He offers a new refinement of his low-price strategy, which involves picking the cheapest stocks within industries, to create a diversified, contrarian portfolio. </p><p> <i>Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation</i> is full of practical and provocative advice, but some of its most interesting passages delve into the abstruse findings of cognitive psychology. This research has proven that we are woefully inadequate as intuitive statisticians. Interpreting data to make predictions about the probability of future events, we consistently make the same mistakes. For example, we exaggerate the likelihood that current trends will continue, even when they are historically exceptional. (Logic dictates that trends are more likely to regress toward the mean.) This fallacy explains why most Wall Street insiders were gloomiest about stocks in 1981, after six years of falling prices, just before the beginning of the greatest bull market ever. Is today's widespread optimism among investors a reason for caution? Dreman thinks so.</p><p> It seems our brains are hard-wired to underperform the market. That's why few investors can keep to a contrarian approach. Dreman recommends buying stocks when prices fall, the worse the panic the better. But that requires overriding powerful instincts.</p><p> Besides reflecting Dreman's wide reading in finance, psychology, and history, his book also displays his sometimes windy and self-important writing style. At 464 pages, the book is not a quick read. But its intellectual depth and thoroughly tested advice make many other investment books look paltry and superficial by comparison. Serious, independent investors will find it rewarding. <i>--Barry Mitzman</i></p>Praise for <i>Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation</i> <p>"A generation of academic research has rested on two basic premises -- that markets are perfectly efficient and investors are rational. Only now are the Ivory Towers waking to what holders of dog-eared copies of David Dreman's original "Contrarian Investment Strategy" have long known: Both premises are wrong. Securities, at times, can be priced very inappropriately, and investors' actions, at almost all times, are based on powerful psychological forces, not on cold, calculated thought. Rather than assume a neat, reasoned world that doesn't actually exist, "Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation" deals with today's market realities. Not surprisingly, Dreman's conclusions are often at odds with conventional wisdom... Skip the academics and just read Dreman." -- Don Phillips, President and CEO, Morningstar, Inc., April 20, 1998 </p><p>"David Dreman has written one of those rare original books on the market that appears every generation or so. Powerful, profound, extremely well documented, it provides totally new strategies for investing in the 1990's and beyond." -- Marshall Loeb, Former Editor, Fortune and Money magazines, February, 1998 </p><p>"Lots of people call themselves contrarians. David Dreman is the real thing. This seminal work puts you far ahead of conventional wisdom, offering dynamic new money making strategies for both the average and the professional investor alike. A classic -- lucid, witty and entertaining. Must reading for anyone interested in beating the market." -- Martin Edelston Editor, Boardroom Reports and Bottom Line, March, 1998 </p><p>"Most people like to think of themselves as contrarians... But few have earned true contrary credentials, with a contrary point of view and a winning record. Dreman is one of the few. Dreman's true contrarian colors come into play when he discusses the stock market's irrationality. In particular, his discussions of the efficient market theory and modern portfolio theory ... are wonderfully scathing. Dreman's conclusion: Independent thought and research beats most popular market theories." -- John Waggoner, USA Today, December 21, 1998 </p><p>"There are relatively few good money managers or good writers on investments. David Dreman is both. In "Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation," Dreman's focus on the understanding of risk should free investors from the mathematical traps of so-called 'risk' measurement. In plain language, Dreman explains that the real risk is investments that underperform for your needs and expectations. This is a great book for all investors, laymen and professionals alike." -- A. Michael Lipper, President, Lipper Analytical Services, February 10, 1998 </p><p>"Dreman's erudition will appeal to any student of history or popular culture... Above all, [his] book peddles common-sense advice from a veteran who's given investing topics decades worth of thought." -- Adam Lashinsky, Chicago Tribune, May 25, 1998 </p><p>"Last week, I was as eager to listen to David Dreman when he visited to talk about his new book -- "Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation" -- as I was after reading "Psychology and the Stock Market" 20 years ago. Dreman is the Maharaja of the Multiples... If you want a reality foundation for investing, get yourself a copy." -- Scott Burns, Dallas Morning News, May 26, 1998 </p><p>"A frequently asked question has been what books would you include in an investment library...[W]e named ... David Dreman's new book, "Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation"... And it's bound to capture attention and arouse controversy... The thrust of his book [is that] common [psychological] mistakes open up opportunities for others to use disciplined value strategies." -- Eric T. Miller, Chief Investment Officer, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, excerpted from Portfolio Manager's Weekly, May 6 and May 13, 1998 </p><p>"Contrarian Investment Strategies" provides a treasure trove of useful research findings. In his eagerness to give something back to his profession, David Dreman is an excellent role model... This book is clearly a labor of love by a man dedicated to discerning the truth amid a morass of emotionalism and cognitive error." -- Martin Fridson, Financial Analysts Journal, November/December, 1998 </p><p>"I have just got into David Dreman's "Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation," and I am going to take the unusual step of putting in a good word for an investment book before finishing it. Canadian-born Dreman is both a money manager who has beaten the market benchmarks and a stimulating independent thinker. This time he adds some timely input on investment psychology." -- Patrick Bloomfield, The Financial Post, May 6, 1998 and May 16, 1998 </p><p>"Overcoming psychological barriers is the hardest challenge when buying out-of-favour stocks. For inspiration the best book I have read is "Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation" by David Dreman. Dreman's funds have an excellent long-term record on Wall Street and his ideas can be adapted here." -- Edmond Jackson, The Sunday Telegraph, January 31, 1999 </p><p>"Loaded with solid advice for the average investor. How can you not like a man who dislikes forecasters, market timers, small cap stocks, complex risk analysis, bonds, bank savings, annuities and selling when the stock market declines. Is this guy tapping my phone?" -- Cliff Pletschet, Oakland Tribune, July 12, 1998 </p><p>"Dreman's latest book, "Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation," expands on his three decades of scrutiny of market trends. Aimed at individual investors and money managers alike, [it] is smart [and] well grounded in history." -- John T. Ward, the Newark Star-Ledger, August 31, 1998 </p><p>"David Dreman writes great books... "Contrarian Investment Strategies" is loaded with great stuff." -- Eric Hanson, President, Hanson Investment Management Inc., The Hanson Newsletter, June, 1998 </p><p>"Frequently described as the dean of Wall Street's contrarians, Dreman has managed to stay ahead of the market by straying from the investment herd. He shares [with the reader] a disciplined strategy ... along with an assessment of investor psychology to make decisions." -- Michael Liedtke, Contra Costa Times, May 22, 1998 </p><p>"Finally an investment book that's not filled with fluff, meaningless data, and boring anecdotes. "Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation" is a Gem... Backed by well-researched data, [he] discredits traditional investment theory, including market timing, with the same tenacity that The Amazing Randy debunks the paranormal. Mr. Dreman's thesis is backed up with loads of data yet he makes the book an easy read by wrapping it with entertaining analogies and anecdotes from his illustrious career." -- David Goldman, The Laughing Stock Broker.com, June 18, 1998 </p><p>"Dreman details the ins, outs, ups and downs of contrarian investing. Undoubtedly, Dreman is the man to do it. Shrewd investors, he asserts, can surpass professional money managers... [His] theories rightly give one pause before jumping on the more popular bandwagons in today's markets." -- Mary Scott, Research, June, 1998 </p><p>"Dreman shows you how to make psychology -- both yours and the market's -- work for you, not against you." -- James W. Michaels, Editor, Forbes Magazine, February 2, 1998 </p><p>"Highly recommended for business collections in both public and academic libraries. [Dreman] emphasizes the importance of investor psychology [investor decisions] which he terms "the necessary link required to activate contrarian strategies." -- Lucy T. Heckman, Library Journal, May, 1998</p></p><h2>How to Twist a Dragon&#39;s Tale: The Heroic Misadventures of Hiccup the Viking (How to Train Your Dragon)</h2><p><b>Don't miss an action-packed, hilarious, heart-warming moment of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series that inspired the hit movies!</b><br><br>The heat is on for Hiccup!

Like a machete, it slashed away the tangle of sleeping dreams holding Gabriela hostage, neither unconscious nor conscious. The baby did that to her. Before the baby she&#x2019;d slept deep and warm and silent, curled next to Marcos. But now there was the baby and Marcos had become a Diablo, a devil, a man who didn&#x2019;t burn up in the fires of hell.</p><p>Thin shrieking cut through the walls of her belly and the baby woke kicking, its little heels thumping into the soft flesh beneath her rib cage. &#x201c;You are a devil like your papa,&#x201d; she murmured, and reached out and turned on the bedside lamp.</p><p>&#x201c;Marcos.&#x201d; Gabriela tugged gently on her husband&#x2019;s earlobe. Asleep he was beautiful, with his round face and straight black eyebrows, his hair falling long on his shoulders like an Apache&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Wake up,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the sirens.&#x201d; She tugged again, harder this time. Marcos caught her hand without waking and kissed her palm. Then his eyes flew open, wide and scared, and he sat bolt upright.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s time?&#x201d; he demanded. &#x201c;Gabby, I&#x2019;ll&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Gabriela never found out what he&#x2019;d do. He was wrapped in the sheet and when he tried to leap out of bed he fell to the floor in a muffle of bedding and curses. She started to laugh but decided against it. The baby liked to sit on her bladder and she had to pee most of the time.</p><p>Again the sirens sounded.</p><p>Looking sheepish, Marcos got up from the floor. &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;My ride is here.&#x201d;</p><p>The sun was going to be up soon and gray light behind the Chisos Mountains made them black like the cutouts children made from construction paper. The street bisecting the village was scuffling with people and horses and dogs and little kids who didn&#x2019;t want to miss the show. Men rode bareback. They had saddles, vaqueros took pride in the tooled leather of their tack, but nobody bothered with saddles now. Diablos also prided themselves on being fast. Men pulled their wives up behind them. Some had sons old enough to be useful and they ran ahead or rode behind.</p><p>Gabriela was so fat she could no longer sit behind Marcos. &#x201c;I got to get a horse with a bigger rump,&#x201d; he joked as he pulled her awkwardly up in front of him. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you stay in bed and let one of these worthless boys bring Tildy back?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I like to see cowboys turn into Devils,&#x201d; Gabriela said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like magic.&#x201d;</p><p>Marcos wrapped his arms around her and the baby she carried and drummed his heels on Tildy&#x2019;s sides. Before she got so big they&#x2019;d race down to the Rio Bravo del Norte, Gabriela holding him tightly around the waist, him bending over the horse&#x2019;s neck. Today they&#x2019;d be one of the last to arrive at the river and she knew Marcos didn&#x2019;t like that, but he was such a good husband he never said anything or told her she was too big to come.</p><p>The Estada de Coahuila in Mexico had let go of their water earlier in the spring. Now, at the bend where the river turned north again, it was shallow enough to walk a horse through without the rider getting his feet wet. Light was leaking around the few clouds on the eastern horizon and the giant reeds on the banks were turning from black to green. The greedy desert gave up little ground to the intrusion of water-hungry plants. Gray stony soil crabbed with the claws of sotol and ocotillo and horse-crippler cactus pushed nearly to the water&#x2019;s edge.</p><p>The first of the mounted Diablos rode into the water and a shout went up as the others followed, horses&#x2019; hooves churning the water, women clutching their men and their skirts to keep them from trailing in the water, children running out to shout across to rangers waiting by a truck with the lights and siren on. Rangers waving and shouting back. On American soil in Big Bend National Park where the Rio del Norte was called the Rio Grande, the vaqueros slid from their horses and caught yellow shirts and helmets from a ranger tossing them from the rear of a truck.</p><p>This was Gabriela&#x2019;s favorite part and, though she&#x2019;d watched it a dozen or more times, she steadied Tildy and stared transfixed as Mexican vaqueros turned into American firefighters, the Diablos, one of the most respected fire crews in the southwest.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Adi�s</i>,&#x201d; Marcos called, and waved his yellow helmet in an arc as the truck backed up the slope from the river, the crew in the back.</p><p>Tildy twitched her ears and neighed softly but she was as steady as a rock. She acted as if she knew Gabriela was carrying a child and didn&#x2019;t sport around the way she did when it was just Marcos on her back. &#x201c;<i>Adi�s, mi querido</i>,&#x201d; Gabriela whispered, and waved until the truck was over the low hill between the road and the river.</p><p>The women and boys were riding the horses back across the river to Boquillas to open up their shops. Business was good. Not as good as two weeks before when American colleges were on spring break and kids came to Big Bend to raft the river. Big Bend was proud of the villages that shared the river. Together they showed how countries should live as friends. The rangers came across to visit and to eat in Mexico, visitors were sent to share a Mexican beer. Boys made money ferrying them across in little skiffs for a dollar or two, and the littler kids laughed and joked as they helped them to get astride the tough little burros, and then, for a quarter, they led the burros into the village where the women had crafts and food for sale. Older boys and men lucky enough to own pickup trucks would take the more adventurous tourists into the wild Coahuila Mountains to camp or hike or just breathe the cleanest air in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>T</b>HREE DAYS LATER, at two-fifteen in the morning, Gabriela&#x2019;s contractions came. Her little sister, Lucia, had been assigned to look after her while Marcos was working fire crew. Lucia, just turned seven and so serious and responsible Gabriela wondered where she had come from, ran to tell their mother.</p><p>Alicia and Gabriela&#x2019;s mother-in-law, Guadalupe, packed her into a borrowed donkey cart for the short trip to the river. Boquillas had no doctor, no hospital and no medicines. That was reason enough to have her baby in America but Guadalupe had delivered more babies than a lot of doctors and bragged that she never lost one. Guadalupe had refused to deliver her first grandchild. She scolded Gabriela for asking and told her the best gift a mother could give her child was to be born in the United States, over the river. The baby would then be a citizen of both the U.S. and Mexico and would have work and an education if he wanted it. Guadalupe had no doubt that her first grandchild would be a he.</p><p>&#x201c;I can walk,&#x201d; Gabriela protested until it was clear they were set on giving her the ride in the cart they had gone to so much trouble to get for her. Guadalupe led the donkey and Gabriela&#x2019;s mother walked beside the cart to hold Gabriela&#x2019;s hand. The jolting down the dirt track made Gabriela groan.</p><p>&#x201c;Shhh,&#x201d; Alicia hissed, then leaned in toward her daughter, the silver in her hair catching the faint light of the moon and running like lightning through the long black hair. &#x201c;Not much longer,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Let the mother-in-law be right. One day you might want money for a house.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabriela and her mother laughed and Gabby did her best to stifle any more ungrateful sounds.</p><p>The river was up half a foot from rains in the mountains. It wasn&#x2019;t more than thigh-deep, but too deep for the donkey and cart. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to have an early baptism for that baby,&#x201d; Guadalupe joked as she and Alicia helped Gabby to climb out.</p><p>&#x201c;This is my best dress,&#x201d; Gabby complained. &#x201c;My best fat dress. I guess tomorrow I won&#x2019;t have to wear it anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No new dresses for you,&#x201d; Alicia said. &#x201c;Once you have children you get no more treats. They all go to the kid. You&#x2019;ll have to take that dress in and wear it till the baby is in high school.&#x201d; Guadalupe laughed. Gabriela wished Marcos was there. He could drink beer and wait and make up lies with his buddies and, when the baby was born, he could come to the river and carry her and the baby home on Tildy&#x2019;s back.</p><p>&#x201c;God I hate this mud,&#x201d; Gabriela said as her shoe sunk into the cool slime then came free with a sucking sound and a slurp that nearly pulled her sneaker off her foot.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t blaspheme,&#x201d; her mother said automatically. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got you. We&#x2019;ll go slow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pick up my skirt,&#x201d; Gabby begged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to go knocking on doors looking like my water just broke. Lift it out of the water.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s too deep,&#x201d; her mother said flatly. &#x201c;Your underpants will show.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not wearing any underpants,&#x201d; Gabby said, and felt a small stab of satisfaction as Alicia began muttering her rosary under her breath.</p><p>&#x201c;You better not let Marcos hear you saying things like that,&#x201d; Guadalupe warned her. &#x201c;He has a temper like his dad.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabriela was glad it was dark so her mother-in-law wouldn&#x2019;t see the smile that came to her lips when she thought of what Marcos would do if she told him she didn&#x2019;t have any panties on.</p><p>With her mother holding her right arm and her mother-in-law her left, the three of them waded into the river. The night was kind, seventy degrees with a whisper of a breeze coming down from the Chisos, smelling of pine and heat and dust laid by the rain. The water was cool and felt good on Gabby&#x2019;s legs and groin. The baby in her belly seemed to float on the water, taking the weight off the small of her back for a change.</p><p>&#x201c;Women should give birth in the river,&#x201d; Gabby said. &#x201c;Women should be pregnant in the river. You can pee anytime you want.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare pee,&#x201d; Alicia said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m downstream.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are going to have that baby in the water if you two don&#x2019;t stop making jokes and move faster.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Remember your house,&#x201d; Alicia murmured in Gabriela&#x2019;s ear and Gabby laughed loudly.</p><p>&#x201c;Now you did make me pee, Mama.&#x201d;</p><p>Before Alicia could make a retort a braying came out of the darkness on the American side of the Rio Grande. A man with a machine amplifying his voice was shouting at them in Spanish:</p><p><i>&#x201c;Se ha carredo la frontera.</i> The border is closed. Go back. This border is closed by order of the United States government.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No it isn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Alicia yelled back.. &#x201c;Not between the park and Boquillas.&#x201d; There was no answering bray, and Gabby&#x2019;s mother urged her forward. &#x201c;Some fool ranger not old enough to go to the bathroom by himself gets those talking horns and thinks he&#x2019;s John Wayne at the Alamo,&#x201d; Alicia grumbled.</p><p><i>The Alamo</i> was Alicia&#x2019;s favorite movie. Gabby had had to watch it at least three times. The only thing that kept it from boring her completely out of her mind was that her mother always rooted for John Wayne and saw nothing funny in that at all. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only a movie,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d tell Gabby and her brother. &#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s real. I can like who I like.&#x201d;</p><p>They&#x2019;d reached midstream when the voice came again and, with it, painfully bright lights. &#x201c;The border is closed,&#x201d; the man announced again. &#x201c;Go back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My daughter is having a baby. She&#x2019;s having a baby right now!&#x201d; Alicia shouted.</p><p>The disembodied voice came back over the water. &#x201c;Crossings are permitted only at authorize...</p></p><h2>The Anonymous Press Study Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous</h2><p>6"x9" red softcover with: - First 164 pages of The Big Book with lined pages opposite text for note taking. - Paragraph numbers along side the text for easy reference. - Comprehensive index with 8000+ word &amp; subject references. - Entire "Original Manuscript" including the stories. - Phone directory of worldwide AA intergroups. - Footnotes explaining the more obscure references in the text and the text changes over the years.</p><p></p><h2>Phantom of the Auditorium (Goosebumps #24)</h2><p>Thinking her friend Zeke is getting too much into his phantom role in the school play, Brooke becomes alarmed when a scary things start happening backstage and wonders if a real phantom is out to stop the show.

After the events of the Fourth Trial, Martial soldiers hunt Elias and Laia as they flee the city of Serra. Laia and Elias are determined to break into the Empire&#39;s most secure and dangerous prison to save Laia&#39;s brother, even if for Elias it means giving up his last chance at freedom. They will have to fight every step of the way to outsmart their enemies: the bloodthirsty Emperor Marcus, the merciless Commandant, the sadistic Warden of Kauf, and, most heartbreaking of all, Helene-Elias&#39;s former friend and the Empire&#39;s newest Blood Shrike. Bound to Marcus&#39;s will, Helene faces a torturous mission of her own-one that might destroy her: find the traitor Elias Veturius and the Scholar slave who helped him escape . . . and kill them both. In 2015, one book emerged as the most highly acclaimed fantasy debut. Now, the sequel will set the world on fire.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of September 2016:</strong> With sequels there&#x2019;s always an underlying worry that the second book won&#x2019;t live up to its predecessor, but Sabaa Tahir&#x2019;s <em>A Torch Against the Night</em> not only meets expectations&#x2014;it surpasses them. Tahir returns to Elias and Laia&#x2019;s quest to rescue Laia&#x2019;s brother from an impenetrable prison while eluding the Emperor and Commandant. Helen, now the Blood Shrike, is under the Emperor&#x2019;s orders to kill them, and it&#x2019;s clear that she still knows her former best friend as well as ever. The stakes are higher in this novel and the suspense just keeps building from new directions. The characters&#x2019; internal conflict is almost painful to read, but that&#x2019;s part of what makes the story so intense. How can you kill someone you love? And how do you watch someone you love die trying to save you?

He also serves as executive producer of <i>The Real Housewives</i> franchise and hosts the network's highly rated reunion specials. He's won an Emmy and two Peabody Awards for his work, and he lives in New York City with his dog, Wacha.<p>Introduction</p> <p>In July of 1989, I was a wide-eyed twenty-one-year-old intern at CBS News in week three of a love affair with New York City that rages on to this day. A pop culture obsessive, I got deeply sucked into the summer media firestorm surrounding the publication of <i>The Andy Warhol Diaries</i>. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to get my hands on a copy, which reportedly was full of dish about everybody in New York City, and when I did, carried it around everywhere (it was big and heavy) until I&#x2019;d devoured the whole thing.</p> <p>I was already a big fan of Warhol&#x2019;s art, but through the book I was completely drawn into his incredibly glamorous world. I grew up in St.&nbsp;Louis and Warhol took me places I&#x2019;d only fantasized about: inside the White House, downstairs at Studio 54 with Bianca and Halston, under the tent at Madonna and Sean Penn&#x2019;s wedding, traveling by helicopter with Diana Ross to see Sinatra in Atlantic City&#x2014;eleven years of this stuff! I felt like I was reading a history of exactly the things I cared about&#x2014;music, art, Manhattan, and all things pop.</p> <i></i> <p><i>The Andy Warhol Diaries</i> came out two years after his death and were a record of over a decade of his daily conversations with his secretary Pat Hackett about what he did the night before, who he saw, and what he thought. His narration is sometimes passive, but on the page he comes off droll and funny, and if you read it closely, there are clear hints of exactly who he was, what he valued, and how he lived his life. The <i>Diaries</i> got slammed by some critics as being nothing more than a vapid assortment of name-dropping and celebrity bashing, but to me it read like a pop culture time capsule with an overlay of commentary from a man fascinated by all facets of celebrity.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m obviously no Andy Warhol, but I too am intrigued by celebrity and spend most of my nights out in NYC. Twenty-six years after Warhol&#x2019;s <i>Diaries</i> ended, I&#x2019;m now a TV producer and host with my own front-row seat to a world not many get to see, in a city that I love. Now I&#x2019;m going through today&#x2019;s versions of the doors that I fantasized about opening when I was reading the <i>Diaries</i> all those years ago. The city has changed a lot since the days when he was on the scene; it seems to me less glamorous and debauched, but no less fun. For years I have told my stories to friends, and wished I kept a diary. Time and motivation were always an issue, and I needed a Pat Hackett to help me launch and record my own pop diary. I found her in my friend Liza Persky, a seasoned talk-show producer who is used to culling stories from celebrities on the phone, and a friend who got this project off the ground with me by recording the first season (Fall) of this book.</p> <p>This book is my own take on Warhol&#x2019;s fun concept: a year in my life, in my own words. It&#x2019;s a life in Manhattan, behind the scenes of a late-night talk show, out on the town, with some stops around the world. It&#x2019;s also a love story about a man and his dog.</p> <p>I wrote this as I would any diary, so there are a lot of first names. Some you&#x2019;ll recognize from my first book (if you read it), some won&#x2019;t need any explanation, a few you might have to figure out on your own. I tried to make that as easy as possible without losing the tone of a real diary. Also I&#x2019;ve left the identities of a few people opaque because I don&#x2019;t want to embarrass anyone <i>too</i> much&#x2014;or be sued or fired.</p> <p>Going back and reading your own diary can be painful&#x2014;and in doing so, I feel the need for some disclaimers. Sometimes&#x2014;like life itself&#x2014;these chronicles are funny, sometimes dishy, and sometimes even a little sad. And sometimes they are really, really shallow. Because sometimes life <i>is</i> shallow. I understand that and have accepted it. I hope you will too. Oh, and I drop a ton of names. More names than you can imagine. I literally almost called this book <i>Diary of a Name-Dropper</i>. So if you want to play a drinking game while reading this book&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s not a great idea and only gonna last for so long&#x2014;take a swig every time you read a name you recognize.</p> <p>I&#x2019;ve often been asked if I would ever turn the cameras on myself and star in my own reality show&#x2014;this book is about as close as I&#x2019;ll get.</p> <p>Oh, and one other thing. In my previous book, I wrote about my first visit to New York City in the winter of 1986 with my friend Jackie, and it bears repeating here. We&#x2019;d been in the city for all of two hours and decided to take an evening stroll. Around every corner, it seemed, was a place I&#x2019;d seen in a movie. My eyes were wide and lit up as bright as the city before me. Then I saw, coming toward us on Madison Avenue, a thin man dressed all in black topped with a wild white wig. It was Andy Warhol. We screamed. I took seeing Andy that night as a good omen, a sign that I had found home.</p> <p><br>Copyright � 2014 by Andy Cohen</p></p><h2>The Story of Art, 16th Edition</h2><p>An illustrated introduction to art appreciation with a survey of the major art periods and styles and descriptions of the work and world of the masters</p><p>The Story of Art is one of the most famous and popular books on art ever published. For 45 years it has remained unrivalled as an introduction to the whole subject, from the earliest cave paintings to the experimental art of today. Readers of all ages and backgrounds throughout the world have found in Professor Gombrich a true master, who combines knowledge and wisdom with a unique gift for communicating directly his own deep love of the works of art he describes. The Story of Art owes its lasting popularity to the directness and simplicity of the writing, and also the author&#39;s skill in presenting a clear narrative. He describes his aim as &#39;to bring some intelligible order into the wealth of names, periods and styles which crowd the pages of more ambitious works&#39;, and using his insight into the psychology of the visual arts, he makes us see the history of art as &#39;a continuous weaving and changing of traditions in which each work refers to the past and points to the future&#39;, &#39;a living chain that still links our own time with the Pyramid age&#39;. In its new format, the 16th edition of this classic work is set to continue its triumphant progress for future generations and to remain the first choice for all newcomers to art.Ernst Gombrich was one of the greatest and least conventional art historians of his age, achieving fame and distinction in three separate spheres: as a scholar, as a popularizer of art, and as a pioneer of the application of the psychology of perception to the study of art. His best-known book, The Story of Art - first published 50 years ago and now in its sixteenth edition - is one of the most influential books ever written about art. His books further include The Sense of Order (1979) and The Preference for the Primitive (2002), as well as a total of 11 volumes of collected essays and reviews. Gombrich was born in Vienna in 1909 and died in London in November 2001. He came to London in 1936 to work at the Warburg Institute, where he eventually became Director from 1959 until his retirement in 1976. He won numerous international honours, including a knighthood, the Order of Merit and the Goethe, Hegel and Erasmus prizes. Gifted with a powerful mind and prodigious memory, he was also an outstanding communicator, with a clear and forceful prose style. His works are models of good art-historical writing, and reflect his humanism and his deep and abiding concern with the standards and values of our cultural heritage.</p><h2>Bones to Ashes: A Novel</h2><p>Discovering the skeleton of a young girl in the neighborhood of a childhood best friend who had gone missing thirty years earlier, Tempe Brennan investigates suspicions that victim and her friend are one and the same.</p><p>Under the microscope, the outer bone surface is a moonscape of craters... <p>The skeleton is that of a young girl, no more than fourteen years old &#x2013; and forensic anthropologist Dr Temperance Brennan is struggling to keep her emotions in check. </p><p>A nagging in her subconscious won&#x2019;t let up.

She is the author of <em>The Salaryman's Wife, Zen Attitude, The Flower Master, The Floating Girl, The Bride's Kimono, The Samurai's Daughter, The Pearl Diver,</em> and <em>The Typhoon Lover</em>. She lives in Minneapolis. </p>Rei Shimura, the Tokyo-based, Japanese-American freelance antiques buyer whom smart mystery fans will remember from The Salaryman's Wife, finds herself the owner of an overpriced, ersatz Edo-period tansu. Bad karma comes with this to-die-for chest of drawers, and Rei becomes, in rapid succession, murder suspect, then murder target. Stuck with bad goods, financial losses and a relationship frayed around the edges, she skips out on her boyfriend and his luxurious lifestyle, and ends up befriended by ex-judo champ Akemi Mihori, who offers her a place to stay on the grounds of the famous Zen temple Horin-ji. Exhausted, scared and a little malnourished, Rei battles growing paranoia that leads her to confuse friend and murderous foe. As with her first novel, Massey manages to combine a very entertaining mystery with lessons in Japanese culture.

She lives in Nantucket.<b>THE GUEST COTTAGE<br></b> Nancy Thayer<br> &nbsp;<br> Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> Outside her daughter&#x2019;s bedroom window, the apple tree was a cloud of white blossoms in the soft glow from the front porch light. Here on the second floor of their stylish suburban Boston house, Lacey slept with her nightlight on and her arms around one of her stuffed animals. At ten, Lacey clung to childhood, and Sophie was glad.<br><br> Because it helps me believe we&#x2019;re still a happy family? Sophie wondered.<br><br>She left Lacey&#x2019;s door fully open; Lacey liked it that way.<br><br>Jonah had left his door to the hall slightly ajar, so Sophie slipped quietly inside. Her fifteen-year-old son was sprawled on his bed, wires hanging from the earbuds he wore even as his steady breathing told her he was sound asleep.<br><br>These children, she thought. This generation will all be deaf by thirty.<br><br>His backpack leaned against his desk. He would have done his homework and packed it up for tomorrow. Jonah was good that way. His computer screen was dark. She flirted with the idea of checking to see what he&#x2019;d been doing last but decided against it. She didn&#x2019;t want to wake him, and besides, one of his video games lay blinking on the floor next to the bed. He&#x2019;d probably spent the last hour vanquishing monsters. She smiled at the thought as she gazed at her firstborn, her precious boy. He was growing up, growing away from her, often gaping at her as if he thought she was hopelessly out of her mind for suggesting he put on a sweater or take his rain gear.&nbsp;<br><br>Jonah wore pajama bottoms and no top. His bony ribs pressed against his skin like staves of a boat. He ate constantly and gained inches, but the rosy plumpness of his childhood was gone.<br> She wanted to lean over and kiss his forehead but was afraid she&#x2019;d wake him. Instead, she pulled a light blanket up over him. In response, he made a snuffling noise and rolled onto his side. She left the room, closing the door behind her.<br><br>This was her favorite time of day, seeing her children tucked safely in bed, sleeping, dreaming, while the house itself seemed to yawn and calm and sink into its own satisfied state of rest.<br><br>Then why, Sophie asked herself, am I so increasingly uneasy&#x2014;so mentally itchy?<br><br>Padding barefoot down the stairs, she thought, as she had so many times, how she never would have chosen to buy this particular house. To Sophie, it was too angular, too spare. But Zack was an architect. He had designed it. He called it clean, fresh, Zen. Over the years, Sophie had managed to soften and cozy it with deep and comfy armchairs, cracked antique wooden wardrobes placed to make hidden niches, colorful fat vases of flowers, and wooden cases of well-read books. The only room Zack would call state-of-the-art now was the kitchen, and she supposed she was happy enough about that. All the newest gleaming chrome and plastic technology that he gave her for her birthdays and Christmas did come in handy. She loved to cook, and Zack appreciated complicated, unusual food. The children, not so much. On the nights when Sophie knew for certain that Zack wouldn&#x2019;t be home, she let them have cheeseburgers, pizzas, meat loaf with mashed potatoes.<br><br>She glanced at the clock. It was after nine. Where was he? He had promised to be home for dinner tonight. He hadn&#x2019;t even phoned.<br><br>She fretted, mildly. This happened a lot, was happening more and more these days. Zack&#x2019;s clients were some of Boston&#x2019;s youngest, wealthiest, and most demanding, and if they wanted an evening consultation, they got it. When she knew he was working late, she enjoyed it, sharing an easy meal with the kids, then curling up with a good book. But he always told her when he wouldn&#x2019;t be home for dinner.<br><br>With a slight sense of anxiety, she went into his study and woke up his computer. She wanted to know: had he told her he was coming home, or had she forgotten that he wasn&#x2019;t? She did not want to believe she hadn&#x2019;t remembered. It wasn&#x2019;t that she and Zack had become adversaries in their marriage; it wasn&#x2019;t that she prided herself on getting everything right all the time&#x2014;or it wasn&#x2019;t all that, only that. She needed to know he was okay.<br><br>The family had computers all over the house. Hers was at the desk in the nook in the kitchen where she kept the calendar of the family&#x2019;s doctor appointments, the kids&#x2019; sports schedules, school conferences. Lacey used that computer, too. At ten, she still needed supervision, and she wasn&#x2019;t as addicted to the technology as Zack was. Jonah&#x2019;s computer was on his desk in his room&#x2014;he had to have it to do homework. Their agreement was that he would leave his bedroom door unlocked so that Sophie could stick her head in and make spot checks. She feared he would wander onto porno sites, but so far he spent all his free time on video games.<br><br>Zack&#x2019;s desktop hummed. Sophie settled in his massive leather chair and searched until she found his calendar. The tempestuous winter was finally over and builders could get out on ladders and scaffoldings and return to work. All his clients wanted everything done at once. More and more Zack shared less and less of his work life with Sophie, but she had been married to him for sixteen years and this was a fact that didn&#x2019;t change.<br><br>Today, April&nbsp;10. Zack had typed: Remember L bday.<br><br>L? Probably Lila, his associate. Lila was twenty-eight, a pretty career girl with an unfettered life and her own BMW convertible. She had no children, a fabulous wardrobe, and an adorable laugh. She considered Zack an architectural genius, unlike Sophie, who considered him a man who should spend more time with his family.<br><br>Yes, he should remember Lila&#x2019;s birthday. Lila was an important colleague, young, bright, and energetic. Sophie wasn&#x2019;t uneasy or jealous&#x2014;she herself had worked as bookkeeper for Zack when he first started out. She knew only too well that when he was working he often lost his charismatic charm and often lost his temper, too. He could be bossy, dictatorial, critical, and a social climber. He was a perfectionist&#x2014;well, she was afraid she probably was, too&#x2014;and single-minded in his ambition. Sophie wouldn&#x2019;t want to work with Zack now. Being married to him was quite enough.<br><br>She focused on the calendar. Nothing there for tonight.<br><br>For tomorrow, April&nbsp;11, Zack had typed: Discuss Div with S.<br><br>Div.<br><br>Her heart banged. She sat back in the chair, unable to take her eyes away from those three letters.<br> Div? The first word that leapt to mind was divorce, but not even ultra-organized Zack would enter a discussion about divorce on his calendar. Would he?<br><br>She closed her eyes. She controlled her breathing. She forced herself to be here now, in this quiet house with her children safe and asleep.<br><br>Div. Could he mean diversifying stocks? Maybe, but Zack handled all that without Sophie&#x2019;s input.<br><br>Div. Diversion? Maybe he wanted them all to go on a trip together. Certainly the family needed to do something like that. It had been far too long since they&#x2019;d done anything together as a family. But really, that was a stretch; Zack wouldn&#x2019;t ever call a vacation a diversion.<br><br>Dividend! Ah. Maybe a dividend, a windfall, had come in on one of Zack&#x2019;s stocks and he wanted to discuss how to spend it with Sophie.<br><br>Right, that was it. Div meant anything but divorce. Who was she kidding? All marriages had their ups and downs, but in the past year or so, the Anderson marriage had been on a steady slide toward a new low. Sometimes she thought she was hanging on only for the sake of the children. <br>She found Zack less and less appealing, more&#x2014;<br><br>The front door slammed, making her jump guiltily. She heard the f<br>amiliar sounds of her husband dropping his briefcase on the hall table, his footsteps toward the kitchen, veering off to his study. Apprehensive but determined, she stayed where she was.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing in here?&#x201d; Zack asked, loosening his tie as he stood in the doorway.<br><br>Sophie studied her husband. Blond hair, blue eyes, former high school football hero, this year he had turned forty. He&#x2019;d started using Grecian Formula. He bought a vintage Mustang convertible.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello to you, too,&#x201d; she said, cocking her head, smiling to take the edge off her words.<br><br>Zack&#x2019;s voice was cool. &#x201c;Sophie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t call,&#x201d; she reminded him.<br><br>Zack made an impatient sound and turned away.<br><br>Her fingertips were tingling. She was angry, frightened, and oddly eager, as if she were about to dive into a strange lake whose depth she didn&#x2019;t know. The children, she told herself. Take care of the children.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you hungry? I could&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired. Going to bed.&#x201d; Zack stepped into the hall, still not looking at her, and all at once Sophie was trembling.<br><br>She went to the doorway and took hold of his arm. &#x201c;Zack. Zack, please, wait. What does div mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>Now she had his attention. As she felt her husband&#x2019;s eyes on her, a fast and familiar sense of being judged swept over her. Okay, she was in jeans and a T-shirt, barefoot, and she didn&#x2019;t know when she&#x2019;d last combed her hair, but she kept her blond hair short so that it was always more or less tidy. She was four years younger than Zack, she was slender, she was pretty enough.<br><br>Sophie repeated, &#x201c;What does div mean?&#x201d; She gestured to his desk. &#x201c;I found it here on your calendar. &#x2018;Discuss div with S.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Sophie, do you really want to get into this now?&#x201d; Zack sagged, signaling his exhaustion.<br><br>She knew he was not that tired. &#x201c;I do, Zack. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll be able to sleep or even remain sane until you tell me.&#x201d; She gazed at her husband, trying to read his expression.<br><br>He shook off her arm, came into the room, and sank into an armchair. &#x201c;Fine. Let&#x2019;s do this. Sophie, I want a divorce.&#x201d;<br><br>In spite of her suspicions, she was shocked. &#x201c;But what about the children?&#x201d; she asked. Jonah and Lacey had no way to shield themselves from pain. Lacey was still sweet and cheerful, but recently, Sophie had noticed changes in Jonah that concerned her. His grades were still good, but he was crashing in soccer and baseball, sports he&#x2019;d always played. His coaches were all over him. If he had to deal with his father&#x2019;s desertion&nbsp;. . . <br><br>&#x201c;Hey, I&#x2019;m not divorcing them,&#x201d; Zack responded, his tone very nearly amused. He was stressed right now, but in his eyes, in his posture, was an obviously smugness. He knew something she didn&#x2019;t know.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you divorcing me?&#x201d; She&#x2019;d done it: the words, those life-changing words, were out in the air between them. Flashing. In neon.<br><br>Zack shook his head impatiently. &#x201c;Come on. Admit it: you -haven&#x2019;t been happy, either.&#x201d;<br><br>Was that true? At this moment, Sophie wasn&#x2019;t sure. She was a good mother, an efficient and creative housewife, a good friend&nbsp;. . . but happy? The palms of her hands went damp; she rubbed them on her jeans.<br><br>&#x201c;Is it Lila?&#x201d; she asked. She sat on a chair across from her husband. If he wanted to, he could reach across and touch her, he could tell her he was sorry, she could suggest they start over&nbsp;. . . <br><br>&#x201c;Does it matter who it is?&#x201d; Zack countered.<br><br>&#x201c;You could fire Lila, and we could start over,&#x201d; Sophie offered.<br><br>Zack flinched. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to fire Lila. I love her. She loves me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wow.&#x201d; Sophie recoiled, trying to absorb his words. He was so very far ahead of her in this situation. &#x201c;Wow, Zack. I don&#x2019;t know what to say.&#x201d;<br><br>Zack snorted with impatience. &#x201c;You see how it is with you? Why can&#x2019;t you cry? Call me names? Throw a book at me?&#x201d;<br><br>Sophie grimaced. &#x201c;So it&#x2019;s my fault.&#x201d;<br><br>Zack slumped. Ran his hand through his thick, sandy hair. Leaned toward Sophie, his elbows on his knees, a pose she&#x2019;d seen so often, the honest man trying to close a deal. &#x201c;Look, Sophie. I&#x2019;m not trying to be a monster here. I know Lila&#x2019;s young. She&#x2019;s new. You and I have been married for sixteen years and the&#x2014;the passion, or whatever you want to call it&#x2014;has faded. You know I don&#x2019;t want to break anyone&#x2019;s heart. I don&#x2019;t want to be the villain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And yet you&#x2019;re screwing Lila.&#x201d; Sophie studied her husband&#x2019;s face, seeing the charm, the force, the concentration he could focus like a raptor on its prey, all of this aimed at her. Once she had admired him for this, adored him for his power. He had changed&#x2014;or she had. &#x201c;You say you love her.&#x201d;<br><br>Zack gave Sophie a pleading look. &#x201c;She makes me feel young again.&#x201d;<br><br>Sophie nodded. &#x201c;I can understand that.&#x201d; After a moment, she said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want the children hurt.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Christ, Sophie, do you think I do?&#x201d;<br><br>No, Sophie thought, Zack wouldn&#x2019;t want to hurt the children. On the other hand, he never thought of his children unless she prompted him. He had never been a natural family man. She took a deep breath, gathering herself. If Zack was the hunter, Sophie was the mother lion, shielding her cubs. Protecting the family.<br><br>This was humiliating, but maybe the right thing to do.<br><br>Sophie forced a pleasant tone. &#x201c;I was planning to discuss this with you&#x2014;Susie Swenson called yesterday. An old friend of mine from college. She has a summer home on Nantucket she wants to rent out for July and August. They call it the guest cottage, because the main house was next door, but they&#x2019;ve sold that off and subdivided the land. Whatever, this place sounds like a mansion: six bedrooms, three baths, everything furnished from linens to lobster crackers. I thought it might be good for you and me&#x2014;and the kids, of course, but especially for you and me. We could walk on the beach. Drink margaritas. Get in touch with each other again.&#x201d; She watched her husband as she spoke. His eyes did not light up; his face did not brighten.<br><br>&#x201c;How much?&#x201d; Zack asked, avoiding her eyes.<br><br>She named a sum and Zack snorted. &#x201c;Nantucket.&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;No. No, I&#x2019;m not paying that kind of money.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you want to go?&#x201d; She reached across and touched his arm. &#x201c;Would you like to try again?&#x201d;<br><br>He patted her hand, as if it were the morose muzzle of a clingy old dog, and drew away. &#x201c;No. And I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s fair for you to expect me to spend that much for you and the kids. You and the kids can stay in the house. I&#x2019;ll move in with Lila.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For how long?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, for good. Now that we&#x2019;ve gotten it out in the open, I think we should proceed. First, a separation. I&#x2019;ll move in with Lila while you and I make the arrangements for the divorce.&#x201d; She observed his eagerness. He was ready to jump out of the chair and leave the house this very moment.<br><br>&#x201c;No, Zack, wait. Give us some time. We&#x2019;re a family. Maybe&#x2014;things&#x2014;will change.&#x201d; The idea of the house on Nantucket shimmered like a beacon in the dark confusion of her marriage. She&#x2019;d been dreaming about it ever since Susie called. She wanted this. She needed this. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to take the kids to Nantucket for July and August.&#x201d;<br><br>Zack bridled. &#x201c;Where are you going to get the money for that kind of rent?&#x201d;<br><br>Sophie smiled. It was the first time she&#x2019;d smiled during this conversation. &#x201c;Aunt Fancy,&#x201d; she said.<br> Aunt Fancy&#x2019;s motto had been: &#x201c;If I&#x2019;ve gotta go down, I&#x2019;m gonna go down in style.&#x201d; She used the last of her inheritance to buy a new wardrobe and have her hair colored red when her husband left her in 1970 when she was just twenty-four.

If I called every other book &#x201c;beautiful&#x201d; it would diminish the importance of the word and I couldn&#x2019;t use it when something as truly stunning as this.

This newly redesigned edition features a brand-new cover by Miller - some of his first comics art in years! It&#39;s one of those clear, cool nights that drops in the middle of summer like a gift from on high. If it weren&#39;t for the rent, Wallace wouldn&#39;t have a care in the world. Then he sees Esther, about to throw it all away - and throw herself off a cliff. Wallace jumps in after her, saves her life, and falls in love, but before he can find out what she was running from, she&#39;s gone again, kidnapped. But Wallace isn&#39;t the kind to lose his head. He&#39;s calm. Like a monk. Like an executioner. And he&#39;ll find her. With a new look generating more excitement than ever before, this third edition is the perfect way to attract a whole new generation of readers to Frank Miller&#39;s masterpiece!</p><p>Can anything be darker than noir? Try Frank Miller's Sin City series. The tasty <i>Hell and Back</i> features Wallace, a brooding artist with a decided talent for hurting people, and Esther, a stunningly beautiful actress accidentally mixed up in a slavery ring that extends far and deep enough to transcend the word <i>conspiracy</i>. The tale twists, turns, and backtracks, teasing the reader with hints of terror to come--until the explosive climax. Miller's art is exactly right for his words; he uses more black than white, and color only when appropriate. The chapter dealing with Wallace's drug hallucinations is beautiful, heartbreaking, and terrifying in turn. Readers interested in the human dark side should find out what fans of Sin City already know: Frank Miller has seen it and wants to share. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><b>Frank Miller</b> began his career in comics in the late 1970s, first drawing then writing <i>Daredevil</i> for Marvel Comics, creating what was essentially a crime comic disguised as a superhero book. It was on <i>Daredevil</i> that Miller gained notoriety, honed his storytelling abilities, and took his first steps toward becoming a giant in the comics medium. After <i>Daredevil</i> came <i>Ronin,</i> a science-fiction samurai drama that seamlessly melded Japanese and French comics traditions into the American mainstream; and after that, the groundbreaking and acclaimed <i>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</i> and <i>Batman: Year One</i>, both of which not only redefined the classic character, but also revitalized the industry itself. Finally able to fulfill his dream of doing an all-out, straight-ahead crime series, Miller introduced <i>Sin City</i> in 1991. Readers responded enthusiastically to Miller's tough-as-leather noir drama, creating an instant sales success. His multi-award-winning <i>300</i> series from Dark Horse, a telling of history's most glorious and underreported battle, was brought to full-blooded life in 1998. In 2001, Miller returned to the superhero genre with the bestselling <i>Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again</i>. Frank Miller continues to push the medium into new territories, exploring subject matter previously untouched in comics, and his work consistently receives the highest praise from his industry peers and readers everywhere. In 2005, with the hugely successful <i>Sin City</i> movie release, codirected with Robert Rodriguez, Miller added a director's credit to his already impressive r�sum� and introduced his characters to an entirely new legion of fans worldwide.</p><h2>The Fire From Within</h2><p>A continuing volume in the tales of Don Juan and internal exploration</p><p>Born in 1925 in Peru, anthropologist <b>Carlos Castaneda</b> wrote a total of 15 books, which sold 8 million copies worldwide and were published in 17 different languages.

At this moment of crisis, a man and woman appear at his office with a coin of unknown provenance, composed of a metal unknown on Earth. Montaro immediately recognizes it as the companion of a coin he analyzed as a graduate student working in a lab at MIT, which was later returned to its unidentified owner. The coin&#x2019;s appearance draws the attention of scientists, collectors, financiers, and thieves, all of whom vie to get their hands on it, and Montaro himself hopes that the discovery of the coin will save his company. But the value of the coin lies not in its monetary worth but in its hold on the people who come into contact with it. These include the young woman who is not aware of the object that was found in her hand at birth; an old man who, as a boy, crafted a wooden compact as a gift for a young Montaro Caine; and the elusive healer Matthew Perch, who, from his hut on a small Caribbean island, knows precisely why these people have been brought together and what wisdom the coin imparts.<br> &nbsp;<br> In his first novel, the beloved actor and director Sidney Poitier takes us on a wild and unexpected adventure&#x2014;from New York to Europe to the Caribbean and beyond.

In fact, during the times when Montaro would look back upon his earliest years&#x2014;before his father died, before the arrival of the Seventh Ship, before a deformed black boy only a few years older than Montaro himself would make him a gift that would change Montaro&#x2019;s life forever&#x2014;he would remember his youth as if it had taken place in some distant galaxy light-years away. He was born in Hyde Park, a Kansas City neighborhood that was home to many academics such as his father, Robert, a professor of mathematics at the University of Missouri. Back then, the neighborhood was one of spacious front porches and vast backyards, just an easy bike ride away from frog-filled creeks and thrillingly perilous ravines.<br><br>To Montaro, childhood was a time of endless summers, a time when the things he loved most were close at hand&#x2014;baseball, the end of school, staying up late to watch the stars with his father, the annual Ozark Mountains hiking trip with his dad and granddad Philip, and most of all, the time he spent with his Kansas City pals. Fueled by seemingly unlimited energy, his wild pack of friends would race across each priceless day in search of adventure, mischief, and fun, until hunger, exhaustion, or weather drove Montaro home, where his mother, Sarah, would always be there to feed him or order him to take a nap or read a book.<br><br>But that idyllic childhood would end suddenly and far too early, in fact not long after he turned eight. For Montaro, life would forever be divided between the time before his father arrived home from a meeting of his university&#x2019;s personnel committee bearing an important letter, and everything that happened afterward.<br><br>The odd part about the letter and all that it would come to represent to Montaro for his entire life was that it seemed to promise good news.<br><br>&#x201c;Sarah?&#x201d; Montaro heard his father call out upon entering his family&#x2019;s sprawling ranch house on that Monday afternoon; in Montaro&#x2019;s memory, his father&#x2019;s voice always seemed to echo throughout the house, but this time it sounded uncharacteristically cheerful. &#x201c;Where are you, honey?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Dr. Robert Caine was a gentle yet intimidating man, stocky and handsome. He was the son of Jewish immigrants from Austria and he counted both bankers and mathematicians like himself among his ancestors. The family name had once been Cohen, until Robert&#x2019;s father, Philip, who left Europe not long before the outbreak of World War II, had changed it at Ellis Island. Though at eight years old Montaro was too young to understand the true nature of his father&#x2019;s brilliance or the fact that he himself would inherit his father&#x2019;s scientific mind, he was always aware on some level of his father&#x2019;s great knowledge and kind authority.<br><br>&#x201c;In here, Robert,&#x201d; Sarah Caine replied from the kitchen where she was cooking dinner&#x2014;roast chicken with apples, which was both Montaro and his father&#x2019;s favorite. Sarah was a graceful woman&#x2014;beautiful, warmhearted, and generous; to Montaro, she was the personification of love, which seemed to radiate from her, casting its glow everywhere, yet most directly upon her husband and son.<br><br>Robert Caine entered the kitchen, embraced his wife, and then presented the letter. &#x201c;It arrived today. Out of the blue,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; She was already able to detect an unusual enthusiasm coming from a man who usually tried hard to downplay his emotions.<br><br>The letter was handwritten on Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital stationery and signed by a Dr. Andrew Banks. Though Sarah Caine had not completed college after she became pregnant with Montaro, she was aware of Dr. Banks&#x2019;s reputation. On many occasions, she had heard her husband speaking of the renowned behavioral scientist. Banks was known primarily for his studies of individuals who were afflicted with varying degrees of mental retardation but were inexplicably gifted in a single area, in some cases to the point of genius. Banks&#x2019;s work had revolutionized the thinking on mental deficiencies. This topic was also of great interest to Robert Caine, who had referenced Banks&#x2019;s studies in some of his own papers. Now, according to the letter he was showing his wife, Robert was being invited to join Dr. Banks&#x2019;s research group for a few days in New York as a member of an observation team consisting of about half a dozen professors to see how autistic patients processed mathematical equations.<br><br>&#x201c;This is wonderful darling; I&#x2019;m so happy for you,&#x201d; Sarah said, then called to her son, &#x201c;Montaro, dinnertime!&#x201d; When Montaro entered the kitchen, he saw that his mother was beaming, and so was his father, who seemed almost stunned by his good fortune. Yes, to young Montaro, this all seemed like good news.<br><br>On his first day at Columbia-Presbyterian in New York, Robert Caine finally got to meet Dr. Andrew Banks, who turned out to be a tall, angular Gary Cooper look-alike. In a mostly empty examination room, Banks introduced Robert and his fellow observers, four men and one woman, all professors, to an autistic man who was said to have astonishing math skills. The man was named Tom Lund, and Banks referred to him as an &#x201c;idiot savant.&#x201d;<br><br>Lund was a blond, wiry, sharp-featured fellow with hooded green eyes, and he appeared to be in his early thirties, about the same age as Caine himself. He was seated on a metal folding chair in the center of the examination room, and he acknowledged the introductions with a lazy nod of his head while avoiding eye contact with anybody present. Dr. Banks and the members of his research team each sat on metal chairs that were arranged in a semicircle around their subject, while Dr. Caine and the other visiting professors seated themselves in a row of chairs behind the researchers.<br><br>Lund was consumed by nervous energy that drove his impatient left foot up and down in an anxious rhythm. He seemed to want to get this show on the road for yet another group of spectators hoping to gain some new understanding of his abilities. Even so, when Dr. Banks posed questions to him, Lund was unable to completely conceal how much he enjoyed being a star subject.<br><br>Banks began by presenting Lund with relatively simple problems, but those problems grew increasingly complex as he proceeded. The more Robert Caine observed, the more he became enthralled. In theory, he should not have been surprised that Lund was able to arrive at correct solutions to the questions that Banks posed. Having read Banks&#x2019;s work, Robert knew that individuals such as Tom Lund would most probably be able to calculate the sum of the first one hundred integers as 500,500 or know that the hundredth prime was 541. But what amazed him was the computer-like swiftness of Lund&#x2019;s calculations. Later that day, when Caine held his first one-on-one interview with Lund, he became only more awed by the man&#x2019;s genius, which seemed almost otherworldly. Caine recorded in his notebook, &#x201c;A stunning experience,&#x201d; then added that there was always so much more to the world than what one initially perceived. The casual observer would have had no sense of all that existed beyond Lund&#x2019;s nervous demeanor and those hooded green eyes; the world was much like Lund, he wrote, so full of unexpected depths, so full of mysteries for men of math and science to solve. Science and education&#x2014;those were the two subjects that Robert Caine valued above all others; these were the two subjects, he wrote in his notebook, that he hoped would be part of Montaro&#x2019;s future as well.<br><br>In New York, Caine spent the next three days interviewing Tom Lund and consulting with Dr. Banks in preparation for a paper he planned to write about his experiences at the hospital. The exchanges with Lund were exceedingly productive, at least according to what Caine wrote in his notes. He appreciated learning from a revered behavioral scientist such as Andrew Banks, and Dr. Banks, too, seemed to benefit from the insights offered by this comparatively young professor of mathematics.<br><br>After Caine&#x2019;s final one-on-one interview with Lund, conducted on his third day at Columbia-Presbyterian, Caine participated in an hour-long discussion in Dr. Banks&#x2019;s office with his fellow researchers regarding their observations and findings. Even though he knew he had to rush to get to Idlewild Airport to catch his plane back to Kansas City, he kept asking questions, holding the microphone of his Dictaphone close to Dr. Banks&#x2019;s face. And even afterward, while he hurried down a long corridor alongside Banks, Robert Caine still wanted to know everything the scientist could tell him about Tom Lund.<br><br>Robert Caine was heading with Dr. Banks toward the hospital&#x2019;s exit when he noticed a patient stepping into the corridor. The patient was a black boy with a twisted chin and a withered right leg, which caused a severe sideways tilt to his body motion as he limped forward. The boy was dressed in a faded gray T-shirt and a pair of old jeans that were much too large for him. He moved toward Robert Caine with an unsettling look of determination in his haunted, unblinking gray eyes. The youngster&#x2019;s face looked deformed&#x2014;his bottom jaw seemed to swing severely to the left of the rest of his face. Both Caine and Banks tried to alter their course to move around him, but the boy blocked their way.<br><br>&#x201c;This is Luther,&#x201d; Dr. Banks told Caine. &#x201c;Luther, this is Dr. Caine. Now step aside, Luther.&#x201d;<br><br>But the boy interrupted by reaching out to Robert Caine. In his hands was a sleek black circular object that resembled a woman&#x2019;s compact. Caine, still holding his Dictaphone, pointed his microphone at the child. &#x201c;For me?&#x201d; he asked with a smile, looking down at the boy.<br><br>&#x201c;Son,&#x201d; the boy corrected in a garbled, guttural voice that was not easy for Robert Caine to understand.<br><br>&#x201c;The sun?&#x201d; repeated Caine, gesturing up toward the ceiling.<br><br>&#x201c;I think he means your &#x2018;son,&#x2019; &#x201d; Banks explained. Then Banks asked Robert, &#x201c;You do have a son, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh yes,&#x201d; said Caine, looking at the boy with surprise, wondering how Luther could have known. &#x201c;I do have a son, and this is for him?&#x201d;<br><br>The boy nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s very nice of you,&#x201d; said Caine, examining the item. &#x201c;And this is very nice, too. What is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a ship,&#x201d; Luther said in his halting speech, which sounded as if it arrived after passing through a mouth filled with marbles.<br><br>&#x201c;Aha. It&#x2019;s a very nice-looking ship,&#x201d; Caine said, though the object didn&#x2019;t bear even the slightest resemblance to a ship. He turned it over, rubbing his fingers along its smooth surface, then held it to his ear and gave it a gentle shake; the compact seemed to have a hollow interior, and Robert made a gesture toward prying it open.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not supposed to open it,&#x201d; the boy said firmly.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; said Robert. &#x201c;But I think I hear something inside.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but it&#x2019;s not delivering anything to you. It&#x2019;s coming to get something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Information,&#x201d; the boy stated.<br><br>&#x201c;What kind of information?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a secret.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d; Caine thought for a moment, then smiled. &#x201c;But suppose my son wants to know. What do I tell him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell him when he comes to see me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When will that be?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When he&#x2019;s older.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Has it got a name, this ship?&#x201d; Caine asked. He felt awkward and didn&#x2019;t know what else to say to the physically afflicted child.<br><br>Dr. Banks stepped forward. &#x201c;All right, Luther, Dr. Caine has to be off. He has a plane to catch.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Luther,&#x201d; Caine said as he and Dr. Banks proceeded down the hall.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s called the Seventh Ship,&#x201d; Luther shouted.<br><br>After a brief look over his shoulder at the small lone figure standing in the hallway, Caine, making sure that the boy was out of earshot, asked Banks, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s his situation?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He makes objects out of wood,&#x201d; replied Banks as they continued to walk.<br><br>&#x201c;He made this compact?&#x201d; Caine asked.<br><br>&#x201c;To him it&#x2019;s a ship,&#x201d; Banks corrected with a playful smile.<br><br>&#x201c;Whatever it is, he made it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;From wood?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The finish is remarkable. It&#x2019;s beautiful&#x2014;as a compact, that is,&#x201d; he added with a chuckle.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh that&#x2019;s nothing,&#x201d; replied Dr. Banks. &#x201c;He can sculpt.&#x201d; Banks slowed his pace and pointed as they approached a door near the exit. &#x201c;His room is right here. Why don&#x2019;t we just peek in for a second?&#x201d;<br><br>Luther&#x2019;s tiny, windowless room was surprisingly well ordered. Everywhere were carvings of toys, buildings, cars, animals, and birds, all astonishingly realistic.<br><br>&#x201c;The hospital allows some of his work to be shown at two art galleries in the city, and in several others around the state,&#x201d; said Banks. &#x201c;His situation is the same as Tom Lund&#x2019;s and the others in our study&#x2014;all the classic signs of retardation, except in the one area where they are exceptional.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How old is Luther?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fourteen.&#x201d;<br><br>To Caine, the boy had seemed much younger, perhaps because he was so short, only around four-and-a-half feet tall.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s his last name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t have one,&#x201d; said Banks. &#x201c;He was abandoned when he was two or three years old. Because &#x2018;Luther&#x2019; was all he could tell them at the agency when he was first taken there, they called him Luther John Doe. They never learned anything about his background, so now he&#x2019;s just &#x2018;Luther.&#x2019; Come, I think you&#x2019;d better be off.&#x201d;<br><br>As they exited Luther&#x2019;s room, Banks continued, &#x201c;On your next visit, after you see Tom Lund, maybe you&#x2019;d like to spend a little time going over our findings on Luther.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I certainly would,&#x201d; said Robert Caine. &#x201c;But let me ask you something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; asked Dr. Banks.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you ever tell him I had a son?&#x201d;<br><br>Banks shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;Then how could he possibly know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; said Banks. &#x201c;Probably he just guessed.&#x201d;<br><br>On the flight back to Kansas City, Robert Caine made numerous entries in his diary, worked on the file he had already started on Tom Lund, and contemplated how he might expand his studies to include Luther John Doe who, he wrote, intrigued him. The private one-hour sessions he had conducted with Lund, exploring the abilities of the young man&#x2019;s brain, were among the most fascinating hours Caine had ever experienced, and he sensed that sessions with Luther would prove to be just as enlightening. Lund&#x2019;s brain was one that had difficulty with some of the most elementary problems of everyday living, and yet in certain areas of mathematics, he could astound the most knowledgeable in the field.<br><br>Caine hoped to have at least six more sessions with Lund before the end of the year, plus another six with Luther, after which he planned to present his paper to Dr. Banks for his approval before submitting it for publication. But Dr. Caine&#x2019;s plane never reached Kansas City. Ten miles from the runway at Mid-Continent International Airport, it crashed, killing everyone on board.</p><h2>Natural Health Bible for Dogs &amp; Cats : Your A-Z Guide to Over 200 Conditions, Herbs, Vitamins, and Supplements</h2><p><b>2000 Winner, Better Health for Life Award, Cat Writer's Association (CWA)</b><br>When it comes to your dog's or your cat's health, you want the best health care available.

If you cherished paper dolls as a child, these charming quilt block designs will bring back delightful memories. Choose from 15 Bonnet Girls, their children, menfolk, and pets and create a family. Depict movement and different scenes by simply changing the positions of bonnets, arms, hands, and legs. More than 30 props - hats, parasols, flowers, animals, and background settings - are interchangeable. Add lace, ribbons, beads, cords, and tassels for a sparkling finish. Lend a sense of weather by quilting wind, raindrops, snowflakes, or clouds. Included are more than a dozen background quilting designs - all suited for traditional applique, redwork, and embroidery.</p><p>Some of Helen Scott&#39;s earliest memories are of playing under her grandmother&#39;s large quilting frames. There she worked on her quilts and those made by her daughters. When Helen started quilting in 1960, she chose applique. Having painted with oils, pastels, and watercolors for many years, Helen found that applique was like painting with cloth. She started teaching embroidery applique and quilting classes in 1982.A favorite subject for appliqu , the familiar Sunbonnet Sue is always captured in side view with a huge bonnet obscuring her face. Sue has sometimes been called the quilt motif we love to hate for her "goody-goody" image. Nevertheless, for many quilters, Sunbonnet Sue brings back memories of simpler, more elegant scenes and times. Unlike any other book on this subject, this volume combines the author's passion for quilting, appliqu , embroidery, and drawing to create 18 bonnet-girl quilts. Scott also provides 30 interchangable props that can be used to create an infinite number of reader-designed pictorial quilts. While not essential, this book is suitable for larger public library and quilting collections. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Changeless (The Parasol Protectorate)</h2><p>Alexia Maccon, the Lady Woolsey, awakens in the wee hours of the mid-afternoon to find her husband, who should be decently asleep like any normal werewolf, yelling at the top of his lungs.

He takes us into his days in the Army as a sergeant (in Astoria, Queens), writing training films with Irwin Shaw, William Saroyan, John Cheever, sunbathing with Bill Holden and competing to see which of them could outdrink the other.<br>Laurents describes a wartime New York City that was vibrant, eager and sexually alive, where he wrote for radio <i>(The Man Behind the Gun; Lux Radio Theater)</i>. He confesses his methods for devising plots: make a list of twists and turns from successful movies, number them from one to fifteen, choose at random and link them up. He describes the writing of his first successful play, <i>Home of the Brave</i>, about anti-Semitism (later made into a movie about racism by Stanley Kramer), and writes about getting on with pals -- among them Jerome Robbins (an imp who loved to play parlour games, the sillier the better; later he testified before the House Committee of Un-American Activities and named names), Leonard Bernstein and Nora Kaye, later Laurent's lover and beloved friend, then a new star in Antony Tudor's Ballet Theatre.<br>In and out of bed with men as well as women, in and out of success with his work, Laurents describes his Freudian analysis with Theodore Reik, who insisted he could "cure" Laurents of his homosexuality, and cure him of what Reik diagnosed as Laurents's "selfishness" by being paid "ten percent of vot you make." Laurents gave; Reik took.<br>We see Laurents going off to Hollywood, reporting for duty at MGM, then a "feudal domain, a prisonlike fortress behind stone walls" . . . driving up to Irene Mayer Selznick's house for the first time and having a sense of deja vu (he had seen it all before in MGM pictures of tastefully grand English country houses -- "No bulter but yards of maids") . . . writing the script for <i>The Snake Pit</i> . . . Laurnets playing volleyball and charades at Gene Kelly's with lots of liberal talk and pot-luck meals . . . playing in Charlie Chaplin's round-robin "Cockamamie Tennis Tournaments" . . . going for&nbsp;&nbsp;a Memorial Day weekend sail with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy on a 125-foot yacht, Hepburn changing into identical spotless white ducks and shirts every hour on the hour with Tracy lolling in a chair, crocked the whole trip, and Hepburn patting pillows behind his neck . . . Laurents writing the script for <i>Rope</i>, a movie with three homosexual men at its center, just as he is beginning a long affair with one of the picture's stars, Farley Granger, as well as an intense, complicated but happy collaboration with the picture's director, Alfred Hitchcock . . . and being propelled out of Hollywood for a life in Paris when his agent, Swifty Lazar, tells him, "You're blacklisted, dear boy . . . the&nbsp;&nbsp;studio said you're too expensive before I mentioned money."<br>Laurents writes about his return to New York and his smash hit play, <i>The Time of the Cuckoo</i>, with Shirley Booth, later made into a movie called <i>Summertime</i> with Katharine Hepburn, then into a musical (<i>Do I Hear a Waltz?</i>, with music by Richard Rogers, words by Stephen Sondheim). He writes about jump-starting Barbra Streisand's career by casting her in her first Broadway show, <i>I Can Get It for You Wholesale</i> ("There was one part available -- a fifty-year-old spinster. Streisand was nineteen. She came in with her bird's nest of scraggly hair and her gawky disorganized body, clumped across the stage, took her wad of gum out of her mouth, stuck it under the chair and began to sing; eight bars into the song, I knew she had to be in the show. I checked later, no gum"). He writes about the creation of <i>Gypsy</i> with Jule Styne and Stephen Sondheim (Laurents to Ethel Merman: "Rose is a monster. How far are you willing to go?" Merman to Laurents: "I'll do anything you want.") . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;about the directing of <i>La Cage aux Folles</i> . . . and about coming together in a complex, fraught collaboration with his three old pals Robbins, Bernstein and Sondheim for <i>West Side Story</i><br>Funny, fierce, honest -- a life richly lived and told.<br>(With 80 photographs)</p><p>Best known as the author of scripts for such hit musicals as <i>West Side Story</i> and <i>Gypsy</i>, Arthur Laurents began his career writing strong, socially conscious plays like <i>Home of the Brave</i> and <i>Time of the Cuckoo</i>; he also has impressive credits as a screenwriter (<i>The Way We Were</i>) and stage director (<i>La Cage aux Folles</i>). Such a varied professional life makes for absorbing reading in this lively autobiography stuffed with famous names, including George Cukor, Katharine Hepburn, Barbra Streisand, and Stephen Sondheim, all of whom emerge vividly in thumbnail portraits ranging from affectionately frank (Stella Adler) to frankly unflattering (Jerome Robbins). Laurents, born in 1917, was a Marxist during his college years at Cornell, and he retains strong political opinions to this day: he has no use for bigots of any kind, and his memoir displays no inclination to forgive people like Elia Kazan, who named names during the 1950s. Yet the author also has a marvelous sense of humor (after critic Frank Rich inadvertently made public reference to Laurents's homosexuality, Laurents introduced him at a charity lunch as "the man who outed me as a liberal") and a zest for life that shines particularly in a loving portrait of his longtime companion, Tom Hatcher. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"The distinguished 82-year-old playwright-director-screenwriter turns his clear, cold eye on everybody he has been close to. Famous for being uncompromising as well as brutally honest, he lives up to his reputation... He has drawn a group portrait of some exceptional people who have now vanished. His book ends up being a tribute to them, and, whether it was his intention or not, it is a tribute to Arthur Laurents as well."<br> -- <i> New York Times Book Review</i><br><p>"A terrific read...a unique document from one of the last of a generation of Broadway greats...Laurents fills his memoir with great dish...But Laurents the man is the enduring star of this story, which makes it a page-turner."<br> -- <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br></p><p>"Wickedly frank." -- <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br></p><p>"An authentic, told-from-the-inside document of what it meant to be a writer, an artist, a lover, and a citizen in the America of the latter half of the last century...Laurents has a dangerously good memory ...By virtue of his relentless clarity and unflinching self-effacement, [he] paints a radiant picture of the kind of life nobody gets to live anymore."<br>-- <i>Vanity Fair</i><br></p><p>"No one is going to accuse Laurents ... of writing a sentimental, evasive or mindlessly feel-good autobiography. In a jaunty, engrossing style, the 82-year-old discusses the highlights of his 60-year career as a writer, director and producer, the ins and outs of his love life, long-term psychoanalysis and friendships with almost everyone in Hollywood and on Broadway. Laurents is brutally honest about his personal life...and he rarely holds back when he thinks that others deserve criticism.... But for all his candor, Laurents comes across as a highly intelligent, loving, politically involved, generous and gracious man--as evidenced by his commitment to social justice, his artistic vision and his long-term relationships with Farley Granger and with Tom Hatcher, who has been his life partner since 1955."<br>-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>Empire of Ivory</h2><p>Used.

However, her brother has his doubts and calls in private detective Cormoran Strike to investigate.<br>Strike is a war veteran--wounded both physically and psychologically--and his private life is in disarray. The case gives him a financial lifeline, but it comes at a personal cost: the more he delves into the young model's world, the darker things get and the closer he comes to terrible danger.<br><i>Published to huge acclaim from readers, reviewers, and writers everywhere, </i>The Cuckoo's Calling <i>is a compulsively readable crime novel, the first in a series featuring private detective Cormoran Strike.</i></p><p><b>Robert Galbraith</b> is a pseudonym for J.K.

When a childhood acquaintance asks him to investigate his supermodel sister&#x2019;s apparent suicide, Strike finds a distraction from his problems that&#x2019;s happily attached to a check. Lula Landry was surrounded by rabid paparazzi, a drug-addled social circle, a dysfunctional adopted family, and a shifty, newly found birth mother, making suicidal despair hard to dismiss. But with Robin&#x2019;s surprisingly adept assistance, Strike dismantles witness statements, applying masterful deductive skills to find evidence of murder. This debut is instantly absorbing, featuring a detective facing crumbling circumstances with resolve instead of clich�d self-destruction and a lovable sidekick with contagious enthusiasm for detection. Galbraith nimbly sidesteps celebrity superficiality, instead exploring the ugly truths in Lula&#x2019;s six degrees of separation. Strike bears little resemblance to Jackson Brodie, but Kate Atkinson&#x2019;s fans will appreciate his reliance on deduction and observation along with Galbraith&#x2019;s skilled storytelling. --Christine Tran</p><h2>Leaving Cheyenne</h2><p>The growth of the Old West is chronicled through the eyes of a Texas rancher, a cowboy, and the woman who is the mother of both their sons</p><p>6 1.5-hour cassettesLarry McMurtry is an award-winning novelist, essayist, and avid bookseller and collector, who won an Academy Award for the screenplay of Brokeback Mountain with cowriter Diana Ossana.

Every project, from a misshapen hat to the most magnificent sweater, holds a story. <i>Yarn Harlot</i> tells all those stories with humor, insight, and sympathy for the obsessed.<br><br>Over 50 million people in America knit. The average knitter spends between $500 and $1,700 a year on yarn, patterns, needles, and books. No longer just a fad or a hobby, knitting has advanced to a lifestyle.<br><br><i>Yarn Harlot: The Secret Life of a Knitter</i> moves beyond instructions and patterns into the purest elements of knitting: obsession, frustration, reflection, and fun. Stephanie Pearl-McPhee's humorous and poignant essays find humor in knitting an enormous afghan that requires a whopping 30 balls of wool, having a husband with size 13 feet who loves to wear hand-knit socks, and earns her "yarn harlot" title with her love of any new yarn--she'll quickly drop an old project for the fresh saucy look of a new interesting yarn.<br><br>Since the upsurge in knitting began in the early '90s, the number of women under 45 who knit has doubled. Knitting is no longer a hobby for just grandmothers--women and men of all ages are embracing this art. Describing its allure is best left to Stephanie who explains: "It is a well-known fact that knitting is a sparkling form of entertainment, as spiritual as yoga, as relaxing as a massage, and as funny as Erma Bombeck trapped in a PTA meeting."</p><p>Stephanie Pearl-McPhee is the author of several books and three collections of essays: <i>Yarn Harlot</i>, <i>Free-Range Knitter</i>, and <i>All Wound Up</i>.

A prolific lecturer and author, he has been at the forefront of key developments in contemporary theology, ranging from narrative theology to the &#x201c;recovery of virtue.&#x201d; Yet despite his prominence and the esteem reserved for his thought, his work has never before been collected in a single volume that provides a sense of the totality of his vision. <br> The editors of <i>The Hauerwas Reader,</i> therefore, have compiled and edited a volume that represents all the different periods and phases of Hauerwas&#x2019;s work. Highlighting both his constructive goals and penchant for polemic, the collection reflects the enormous variety of subjects he has engaged, the different genres in which he has written, and the diverse audiences he has addressed. It offers Hauerwas on ethics, virtue, medicine, and suffering; on euthanasia, abortion, and sexuality; and on war in relation to Catholic and Protestant thought. His essays on the role of religion in liberal democracies, the place of the family in capitalist societies, the inseparability of Christianity and Judaism, and on many other topics are included as well. <br> Perhaps more than any other author writing on religious topics today, Hauerwas speaks across lines of religious traditions, appealing to Methodists, Jews, Anabaptists or Mennonites, Catholics, Episcopalians, and others.<br></p><p>Praise for Stanley Hauerwas from noted academics, clergy, and others: <p>&#x201c;Stanley Hauerwas is the theological ethicist of our times.

If you do know him, well, then, you already know that each reading and re-reading will bring surprises. And blessings.&#x201d;&#x2014;Peter Ochs, Bronfman Professor of Modern Judaic Studies, University of Virginia </p><p>&#x201c;It would be hard to overestimate the value of Stanley Hauerwas&#x2019;s contributions to theological conversation and religious life in today&#x2019;s world. Alternately brilliant and exasperating, his work is indispensable in helping us find our way in a dark time. This wonderful reader is the best introduction to Hauerwas currently available.&#x201d;&#x2014;Robert N. Bellah, coauthor of Habits of the Heart </p><p>&#x201c;Texans and Christians are troublesome. At odds with enlightened liberal cosmopolitan pretensions, they embrace particularity. One cannot deduce either Texas or Christianity from reason or from human nature. Hauerwas as a Texan Christian has for three decades reminded us forcefully of the importance of taking the troublesome particularity of Christianity seriously. These essays provoke, engage, and instruct. They are a superb selection from the work of one of the most important theologians of our time. Everyone, whether Christian or non-Christian, believer or atheist, should read these essays; they are key to understanding the religious, moral, and metaphysical struggles of our age.&#x201d;&#x2014; H. Tristram Engelhardt, Jr., Ph.D., M.D., Rice University, Baylor College of Medicine </p><p>&#x201c;Stanley Hauerwas challenges, informs, provokes, and inspires anyone who reflects seriously on faith and life. The Hauerwas Reader is an invitation to accompany one of today&#x2019;s most provocative and creative thinkers on a transforming theological journey beyond our comfortable idolatries.&#x201d;&#x2014;Bishop Kenneth L. Carder, Mississippi Episcopal Area, The United Methodist Church </p><p>&#x201c;For decades now Stanley Hauerwas has been the most eloquent voice proclaiming the morality of particularism and the immorality of universalism. In a liberal culture that voice is heard as both alien and unreasonable, accusations Hauerwas no doubt cherishes.&#x201d;&#x2014;Stanley Fish, author of The Trouble with Principle </p><p>&#x201c;This one-volume Hauerwas reader provides us with a rounded view of one of the greatest theological minds, who is equally one of the greatest ecclesial forces, of the postmodern era.&#x201d;&#x2014;John Milbank </p><p>&#x201c;Stanley Hauerwas is an unparalleled force for courage and generative thinking across the spectrum of Christian thought. Sometimes he heals and energizes, sometimes he (deliberatedly) infuriates. Always he claims attention and redefines the theological task. For his allies as well as his adversaries, the publication of his papers is a welcome resource. It makes available much that is needed for continuing work. Hauerwas draws us into the contemporary theological emergency and points us in fresh ways through it.&#x201d;&#x2014;Walter Brueggemann, Columbia Theological Seminary </p><p>&#x201c;Covering a range of ethical concerns from healthcare to warfare, these essays show again how Stanley Hauerwas brings together Evangelical and Catholic foundations for an ethics based on faith. The articles ring true, which is to say they speak first of Christ and only then of life in Him.&#x201d;&#x2014;Francis Cardinal George, Archbishop of Chicago </p><p>&#x201c;Stanley Hauerwas is the most prolific and provocative theological ethicist writing in the U.S. I dissent strongly from many, perhaps most, of his conclusions. His arguments and scholarship often strike me as unsound. It is not easy to know whether he is raising or lowering the standards of debate over the ethical significance of Christian commitments. But Hauerwas is too important to be ignored. This volume puts a representative sample of his most interesting and challenging writings between the covers of a single book. The next time I teach my introductory course on Christian ethics, it will be required reading.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jeffrey Stout, Princeton University </p><p>&#x201c;For many years Stanley Hauerwas has been lobbing peaceable bombs into the moral theologians&#x2019; playground, awakening them from their undogmatic slumbers to the importance of truthful action. The best of these bombs are here, in a wonderful arsenal of Hauerwas&#x2019;s essays. Beware! Hauerwas is always challenging, provocative, illuminating, exasperating, disturbing, and fresh.&#x201d;&#x2014;Duncan Forrester, New College, The University of Edinburgh </p><p>&#x201c;The Hauerwas Reader is of specific importance for the ethical discourses in the European context. Hauerwas forcefully presents a church-oriented social ethics in ways that help to rediscover the critical impact of a forgotten tradition on mainstream protestant ethics. Because of his innovative theological revision of the moral issues in the ethical discourse of our present time, the serious engagement of Hauerwas&#x2019;s work is a must for European ethicists.&#x201d;&#x2014;Hans G. Ulrich, Institut f�r Systematische Theologie, University Erlangen-Nuernberg</p>&#34;This collection is obviously a labor of love. Fortunately, it is also a labor of editorial care and precision. In addition to first-rate introductory material, the writings of a master provocateur are gathered here in a fresh, synthetic format.

Eleven-year-old Mark Sway and his younger brother&nbsp;&nbsp;were sharing a forbidden cigarrette when a chance&nbsp;&nbsp;encounter with a suicidal laywer left Mark knowing&nbsp;&nbsp;a bloody and explosive secret: the whereabouts of&nbsp;&nbsp;the most sought-after dead body in America. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark is caught between a legal system gone mad&nbsp;&nbsp;and a mob killer desperate to cover up his crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;And his only ally is a woman named Reggie Love,&nbsp;&nbsp;who has been a lawyer for all of four years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosecutors are willing to break all the rules to make&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark talk. The mob will stop at nothing to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;him quiet. And Reggie will do anything to protect&nbsp;&nbsp;her client -- even take a last, desperate gamble&nbsp;&nbsp;that could win Mark his freedom... or cost them&nbsp;&nbsp;both their lives.</p><p>Mark Sway, age 11 but years wiser thanks to a drunken dad who abused his mom, is out in the woods behind his Memphis trailer park teaching his kid brother, Ricky, how to smoke Virginia Slims heisted from Mom's purse. He's a pretty upright kid--he's determined to protect his brother from drugs, and he once defended his mom with a baseball bat. <p> The dangers of smoking rapidly escalate when Mark glimpses a guy trying to commit suicide by carbon monoxide in his car nearby and tries to stop him. The guy is Jerome, a lawyer who tells Mark that his Mafia client has murdered Senator Boyd Boyette and buried him in the concrete under his garage in New Orleans. Then Jerome puts a bullet in his own head. Little Ricky flips out, and so does Barry the Blade Muldanno, who doesn't want blustery U.S. attorney Reverend Roy Foltrigg to find the corpse and bust him. Caught in a ruthless game between the Mob and the amoral authorities, Mark's family has no defense in the world except Reggie Love, a 50ish divorc�e who has just turned her life around by becoming a lawyer.

At a time when America is lamenting the lack of solid training in the sciences at the elementary and secondary levels, Dewey&#39;s enthusiastic correlation between the scientific mind and the natural attitude of childhoodmarked by curiosity, imagination, and the love of experimental inquiryoffers a refreshing and optimistic perspective. He demonstrates how an appreciation of this correlation and a recognition of its value in educational practice can promote individual happiness and reduce social waste.</p><p>John Dewey (1859-1952) authored more than two dozen books and scores of articles in both scholarly and popular publications. He rightly deserves the title of America&#39;s foremost philosopher and his work will influence intellectuals throughout the world for many years to come.</p><h2>Closer: A Play</h2><p>In Closer, Patrick Marber has created a brilliant exploration into the brutal anatomy of modern romance, where a quartet of strangers meet, fall in love, and become caught up in a web of sexual desire and betrayal.

He had only one sibling, and he grew up in a stable middle-class household with both parents present. After the age of eleven he lived in the suburbs.<br>His father owned a profitable business and no one in the family ever lacked for money. In the somnabulent 1950s, young Johnny Martorano served as an altar boy and later went to both parochial and prep schools where his friends included, among others, a future congressman and a future CBS news reporter. Summers he and his brother Jimmy went to camp in the Berkshires. His parents owned a second home on the South Shore. At age sixteen, as soon as he got his driver&#x2019;s license, his father bought him a blue 1949 Plymouth sedan.<br>And yet somehow, Johnny Martorano was always fascinated by the city. He was always drawn back to the mean streets of Boston, where his father ran a restaurant and after-hours club in what would soon become known as the Combat Zone.<br>Both his parents came from large immigrant families. His maternal grandparents were Irish, had met in England, and later immigrated to the United States, where they raised eleven children in the Somerville-Medford area, just north of Boston. His mother&#x2019;s maiden name was Elizabeth Mary Hunt. Everyone called her Bess.<br>His father was born in Riesi, Sicily, the son of a cobbler, one of thirteen children, only five of whom survived beyond childhood. The Martoranos immigrated to the United States when Angelo Martorano was seven years old, around 1915. They lived in East Boston. His first name was soon Anglicized to &#x201c;Andy,&#x201d; and for the rest of his life he answered to either Angelo or Andy.<br>Johnny&#x2019;s father was always a hard worker, and after graduating from high school, he became a cab driver. Soon he owned his own Boston medallion, then two. He supplemented his income by working as a small-time bookie, taking numbers and bets, mostly on horses. In 1939, he met his future wife, who was working for a dry cleaner in Somerville.<br>After their marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Martorano moved to Bess&#x2019;s hometown of Somerville. They lived on the first floor of a rented two-decker off Ball Square, at 96 Pritchard Avenue. Johnny&#x2019;s cousins lived on the second floor. Eleven months after Johnny&#x2019;s birth, his only sibling, Jimmy, was born. Some of Johnny&#x2019;s earliest memories were of visiting his paternal grandparents, who lived on Neptune Road in East Boston.<br>In Somerville, just after the end of World War II, Johnny began school at St. Clement&#x2019;s. He was young, five years old, when he started the first grade, and the nuns decided to hold him back. From then on, he and his brother Jimmy would go through school together in the same grade.<br>I was Sister Patricia&#x2019;s pet&#x2014;the teacher&#x2019;s pet. I used to wait every morning to carry her bag from the rectory to the school. But I got into trouble, too. I remember one day, I must have been eight or nine. My father had a big black four-door Dodge outside the house; he always had a big bankroll. Anyway, he was sleeping one morning, and I went downstairs. I put on his hat and took one of his cigars. Then I grabbed his bankroll and I went out onto the street and started giving money away. I looked like one of the Little Rascals. Finally my mother got a telephone call from one of the neighbors and she ran out of the house chasing me, trying to get the money back.<br><br>Abie Sarkis, major Boston bookie and longtime business partner of Andy Martorano.<br>Andy Martorano was doing well in the postwar economy. He bought another medallion, and put his brothers, Danny and Louie, to work as drivers, until Louie got a job selling cars. By then, though, Andy had gone into the restaurant business, with Abie Sarkis, a big-time Boston bookmaker who became Andy&#x2019;s lifelong friend. Their place was on the second floor above the Intermission Lounge at 699 Washington Street in the middle of what would someday be the Combat Zone, although in those days the city&#x2019;s red-light district was still a few blocks north, on Tremont Street. It was known as Scollay Square.<br>Abie and Andy called their restaurant Luigi&#x2019;s, and it did well from the start. But it did better when they opened up what they called the &#x201c;backroom,&#x201d; an after-hours club. They could charge more for a drink after last call, and they didn&#x2019;t need to keep the kitchen open. The only overhead was the weekly payoff to the cops in District 4. But in the mid-1950s, Abie Sarkis had a bad run in the numbers. He was deeply in debt, and to raise money, he sold out his half of Luigi&#x2019;s to Andy Martorano.<br>Now owning Luigi&#x2019;s outright, Andy Martorano soon had even more disposable income. He had a friend in Revere, Joe DeAngelis, who was trying to set himself up as a shylock on Shirley Avenue. In those days no one but the wealthy had credit cards, and for the workingman the only line of credit came from the loan shark on the corner. By the 1960s, Joe Dee had $100,000 of Andy&#x2019;s money out on the street, at a point or two (1 or 2 percent) a week. It was a good solid return on investment, and like municipal bonds, it was tax-free.<br>Soon, Andy and Bess Martorano decided that Milton, just south of the city, would be a better place to raise the boys than rough-and-tumble Somerville. Their first house was at 79 California Avenue. Later, Andy bought a vacant lot around the corner and built a new house, on 64 Lockland Street.<br>After he got married, my father quit as a bookie, but he still loved to gamble. And Andy liked baseball better than the track; in the summer he was always at the ballgames. This was back before the Braves moved to Milwaukee in &#x2019;53, so there was a game in Boston almost every day, either at Fenway or at Braves Field, which is now Nickerson Field at BU.<br>My father used to take me with him to a lot of the games. One time I remember Sam Jethroe, the first black player on the Braves, was playing center field, and he misjudged a fly ball and it hit him on the head.<br>We used to sit with this group of guys, usually way up in the right-field grandstand, or sometimes in the bleachers&#x2014;always off by themselves. They knew all the ushers, so they got in for free. There was plenty of room, and plenty of empty seats. Back then, the Red Sox didn&#x2019;t draw like they do now, and the Braves drew nobody. That&#x2019;s why they finally had to move.<br>My father and his friends didn&#x2019;t care if nobody was there. They were there to gamble. There were maybe fifty to a hundred of them, depending on the game, who the Sox or the Braves were playing. Mostly Italians in the group, but other people, too. The common denominator was betting. That&#x2019;s what these guys did. Some of them had businesses, like my father. There was another guy who owned a baby carriage company. I guess there were some wiseguys there, too. They&#x2019;d gamble on every pitch, was it going to be a ball, or a strike? They&#x2019;d bet on whether the batter was going to get a hit, strike out, ground out, or fly out. Anything, just action. Ted Williams comes up, maybe the odds were 20-1 or 30-1 that he&#x2019;d hit a home run, depending on how good the pitcher was. Longer odds if the batter wasn&#x2019;t that good a hitter, or if the pitcher was better. Everybody kept a pad of paper and a pen on their laps so they could keep track of the bets, because they&#x2019;d be making so many of them over the course of nine innings. At the end of the game, everybody would settle up.<br>That&#x2019;s how I learned to gamble, from my father. He taught me how to gamble and how to drink.<br>Johnny and Jimmy were now enrolled in St. Agatha&#x2019;s parochial school in Milton. They were in the same class as a young Quincy boy named Billy Delahunt, a lefty. Johnny was a good all-around athlete, but his best sport was football. One day on the playground he ran over Mother Superior, and she chased him down the street with her cane. Another time he kicked a football through a window in the school.<br>Johnny was a popular kid, a natural leader. Years later, Billy Delahunt, by then a congressman, was bragging at a party that he had never lost an election&#x2014;as state rep, district attorney, or congressman. Someone else at the party, another St. Agatha&#x2019;s alumnus, corrected Delahunt&#x2014;he had lost at least one election, for the presidency of the seventh-grade class at St. Agatha&#x2019;s. To Johnny Martorano.<br>There was a priest there, a young guy, Father Riley. A great athlete. He called me Rocky.

Cuban cooking was at the center of my culture right fromthe beginning.</p><p>My great-grandfather, my grandmother Consuelo's father, was renowned for hiscooking, and he served as the personal chef for two presidents in Cuba. His daughter,my grandmother Consuelo, was also an amazing cook. She left Cuba with mygrandfather when she was fifty-six years old. At that time, the Cuban governmentwould not allow anyone out of the country with any personal possessions. Eventhough they arrived in the United States with empty pockets, they were filled withintegrity, determination, and hope. So she told my grandfather: &#x201c;I've got an idea. Ifit works we're going to be okay. And if it doesn't, then we're going to be living under a bridge.&#x201d;</p><p>Her feeling was that if you do what you love, people will love what you do. Andher love was cooking.</p><p>She had rented a house that had its backyard facing a park in Miami where LittleLeague games were held. One day, she decided to make <i>croquetas</i>, tamales, and <i>pan con lech�n</i> sandwiches&#x2014;all foods that would travel well and that she could put in a shopping cart. She walked the cart over to the park and the very first day, she sold out of all the items she had brought. Just like that, her cooking became her livelihood. Her entrepreneurship paid off. Before long, she was earning about $5,000 each weekend&#x2014;a very successful home business for the 1960s.</p><p>As her business grew more successful over time, she began to offer catering servicesfor weddings, <i>quincea�eras</i> (sweet fifteen parties) and other occasions for hercustomers and friends. Despite the growing business, she continued to do all thecooking herself. I lived with my grandma Consuelo, so I would spend my entire dayin the kitchen with my <i>abuela</i>, helping her and watching her cook. And even today, some of my most treasured memories are of the days I spent with her.</p><p>My grandmother loved to feed me&#x2014;she made it her mission. From her point ofview, I was too skinny as a child. I was really just a normal-sized kid, but to Cubansnormal is still considered &#x201c;skinny.&#x201d; She would do anything to get me to eat more.We would start eating at the kitchen table and she would give me my last mouthfulof food sitting on the butcher's counter three blocks away. She couldn't stop feedingme. She would say, &#x201c;Okay, now one more&#x201d; and &#x201c;Another one&#x201d; and so on. It was soimportant to her that I eat.</p><p>This constant feeding frenzy continued throughout my upbringing. She wasconstantly trying to feed me and make things that I would like. Although, I have toconfess, I'm not a martyr. I loved everything she made! There was so much love inher cooking that today, for me, love and food are completely intertwined.</p><p>I don't have a single memory of my grandmother Consuelo where she's not cooking.For her, cooking was her life and her art and it sustained her family in every way.</p><p>My grandfather, on my father's side of the family, was also an amazing and verysuccessful cook. He actually managed one of the first Cuban restaurants in Miami,Salon Tropical. I remember watching him as he would come over to my parents'house and cook for us.</p><p>From those experiences and influences early in my life, I've never really needed tocook from a recipe. Like my grandmother, I'm resourceful. I can prepare a meal withvirtually any ingredients I find in the fridge.</p><p>My grandmother's dream was always to open a restaurant. When my grandfather passed away, she had to run the catering business on her own. She was resilient andmanaged to do well, yet her dream of having her own restaurant never materialized.</p><p>Many years later, after Emilio and I achieved success with our music, an opportunitycame along to open a Cuban restaurant on Miami Beach. Emilio and I reallyfelt it was a great extension of what we had already accomplished through our music,which was to showcase our culture to the world. It was another way to show our fanswho we are&#x2014;not just through our music, but through our culinary heritage.</p><p>The restaurants brought those two worlds together for us. When you walk into anyone of our restaurants, you're surrounded by Cuban music while you eat. So it's foodand music, two of the best things in life. For us, it was just a very natural progression.And for me there was the added value of making my grandma's dream come true.Although my grandmother Consuelo was no longer with us, it was always somethingthat I wanted to do for our culture, but mostly for her.</p><p>Our restaurants allow people from all over the world to discover Cuban food, andlearn more about our culture and our heritage. And very often they're surprised bythe food. Generally speaking, people think that Cuban food is very spicy, and it's notthat way at all. We marinate a lot, so the dishes are very tasty and richly flavored, butnot very spicy.</p><p>Here, in this book, we hope to share our culture and our food with you. Thosewho are fans of our restaurants will be able to cook at home the dishes they love. Andthose who haven't made it to one of our restaurants yet can still enjoy the great foodswe make there, and at our home.</p><p>We are honored to share them with you the way my grandmother did&#x2014;with love.</p><p><b>Masitas de Puerco</b></p><p><i>Masitas de puerco</i>, fried pork chunks, is a typical Cuban dish, born in theisland's countryside. After the people made pork, they would leave chunksof the pork marinating overnight. When they went to reheat the pork the followingday, it was already saturated with flavor. That's how they made fried pork chunks.One of the great things about<i> masitas de puerco </i>is that they serve many purposes.Often enough, we'll serve them as a main course, along with some<i> tostones</i>Or<i> platanos maduros </i>and rice and beans.

Silber.She is presently practicing law in Boston.She and her husband James live in Marblehead, Massachusetts.Plainspoken reminiscences from the only man to fly both of the missions that dropped atomic bombs on Japan, bringing WW II to a close. A love of flying took Sweeney from his boyhood home in suburban Boston into the US Army as an air cadet well before Pearl Harbor. After winning his wings and a commission on December 12, 1941, he bounced about stateside commands until the fall of 1943. Desperate to secure an overseas assignment, the 23-year-old captain talked Lt. Colonel Paul Tibbets into giving him a billet with the 509th Composite Group. The 509th had been chosen to use the incredibly destructive weapons developed by the Manhattan Project against Japan. Following an intensive training regimen at well- guarded bases in remote areas of America's vast Southwest, Sweeney and his comrades-in-aerial-arms arrived on Tinian in mid-1945. By now a major, he piloted the instrumentation plane that recorded the effects when Tibbets conducted a picture-perfect strike that decimated Hiroshima on August 6. Three days later, Sweeney led the unescorted superfortress flight that laid waste to Nagasaki. While history's first A-bomb assault went like clockwork, the author and his crew had to overcome problems with their plutonium device, fuel shortages, and a host of other difficulties. Shortly after Japan's surrender, he was able to get a first-hand look at the ruins of Nagasaki. While the experience left him hopeful that humankind will never again engage in nuclear warfare, Sweeney (a devout Catholic) has no regrets for the role he played in bringing a cruel and costly global conflict to a decisive end. Nor does the retired major general have much patience with revisionists who give Japan victim status for the devastation it suffered. Eloquent, engrossing testimony of an old-fashioned patriot at peace with his consequential place in military and world history. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Jay Parini spent over twenty years interviewing friends of Frost and working in the poet's archives at Dartmouth, Amherst, and elsewhere to produce this definitive and insightful portrait of both the public and private man. While he depicts the various stages of Frost's colorful life, Parini also sensitively explores the poet's psyche, showing how he dealt with adversity, family tragedy, and depression. By taking the reader into the poetry itself, which he reads closely and brilliantly, Parini offers an insightful road map to Frost's remarkable world.<br></p><p>Robert Frost, the farmer-poet of New England, actually spent his formative early years in San Francisco. His mother moved the family east after the death of her husband--a hard-living journalist from whom Robert took his willful perversity. He attended Dartmouth and Harvard, leaving both prematurely, and after putative stabs at teaching and journalism became a poultry farmer in New Hampshire. It took a trip to England in 1912 (to live "under thatch") for his poetry finally to be published, and when he returned to America in 1915 his reputation had preceded him. Until his death in 1963, he worked assiduously at consolidating his position as America's premier voice; reading at Kennedy's inauguration and meeting Khrushchev were just two of the scenes he stole. So why does Jay Parini need to reclaim him?<p> The answer lies with Lawrance Thompson. Thompson was one of Frost's most earnest disciples, and for years the poet, ever eager to shape his own image, allowed him a Boswellian intimacy. Unfortunately, Thompson came to despise his former mentor, and his exhaustively documented volumes portray Frost as a kind of solipsistic monster, in marked contrast to the awe with which he had previously been described. Parini, also a biographer of John Steinbeck, in a wave of perspective seeks a corrective to Thompson's bile. His writing is intelligent yet breathlessly generous, and he is at his best when considering the poems themselves. He rightly ascribes to Frost the innovation of the colloquial voice in serious verse--a legacy that appears immense today when so much contemporary poetry consists of little else. Frost's mastery lay in the freedom he found within conformity and the dark corners he discovered by probing, which contribute to a melancholic spirituality beyond the rusticity for which he is popularly celebrated. While Thompson's egg is cracked and dry, Parini prefers a softer boil, and his elegantly reverential tone is imbued with a perception that reminds readers how great a poet Frost remains. The clergyman who advised him at an early age that his verse was "too close to speech," and thus gave him his voice, deserves eternal gratitude. <i>--David Vincent, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Jay Parini, a poet, novelist, and biographer, is Axinn Professor of English at Middlebury College.

In this sure-to-be-controversial book, Chalmers Johnson lays out in vivid detail the dangers faced by our overexted empire, which insists on projecting its military power to every corner of the earth and using American capital and markets to force global economic integration on its own terms. From a case of rape by U.S. servicemen in Okinawa to our role in Asia's financial crisis, from our early support for Saddam Hussein to our actions in the Balkans, Johnson reveals the ways in which our misguided policies are planting the seeds of future disaster.<br><br>In the wake of the Cold War, the United States has imprudently expanded the commitments it made over the previous forty years, argues Johnson. In Blowback, he issues a warning we would do well to consider: it is time for our empire to demobilize before our bills come due.<br></p><p>If the 20th century was the American century, the 21st century may be a time of reckoning for the United States. Chalmers Johnson, an authority on Japan and its economy, offers a troubling prognosis of what's to come. <i>Blowback</i>--the title refers to a CIA neologism describing the unintended consequences of American activity--is a call for the United States to rethink its position in the world. "The evidence is building up that in the decade following the end of the Cold War, the United States largely abandoned a reliance on diplomacy, economic aid, international law, and multilateral institutions in carrying out its foreign policies and resorted much of the time to bluster, military force, and financial manipulation," writes Johnson. "The world is not a safer place as a result." Individual chapters focus on Okinawa (where American servicemen were accused of raping a 12-year-old girl in "Asia's last colony"), the two Koreas, China, and Japan. The result is a liberal-leaning (and Asia-centric) call for the United States to disengage from many of its global commitments. Critics will call Johnson an isolationist, but friends (perhaps admirers of Patrick Buchanan's <i>A Republic, Not an Empire</i>) will say he simply speaks good sense. All will agree he is an earnest voice: "I believe our very hubris ensures our undoing." <i>--John J. Miller</i>Chalmers Johnson, president of the Japan Policy Research Institute, is author of the classic <i>MITA and the Japanese Miracle and Japan: Who Governs?</i></p><h2>Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived</h2><p>Some people are born to lead and destined to teach--not by precept, but by the example of living life to the fullest. Peter Barton was that kind of person.<br><br>He protested at Columbia University in the 1960s, played soul music at Harlem's Apollo Theater, spent time as a ski bum and a craps dealer, and eventually emerged from Harvard Business School to become a central figure in the creation of cable television. In the prime of his life, happily married and the father of three young children, Peter came face to face with the biggest challenge in a life filled with risk-taking and direction-changing. Diagnosed with cancer, he began a journey both frightening and appalling, yet also full of wonder and discovery.<br><br><i>Not Fade Away</i> recreates that journey in the intimate and alternating voices of Peter and of Laurence Shames--two men close in age yet who've chosen vastly different lives. Together, in a spirit of deepening friendship, they relive the high points of years that embodied the hopes and strivings of an entire generation. With courage, candor, and even humor, they search for meaning in Peter's unflinching confrontation with mortality.<br><br>In life, Peter was an overachieving Everyman, a vibrant spirit who showed his peers just how much is possible. In his dying, similarly, he redefines the quietly heroic tasks of seeking clarity in the midst of pain and loss; of breaking through to a highly personal, secular faith; and of achieving peace at last.</p><p><p><i>Look, I don't kid myself that my little death is any more important than those of the five or six billion people who've died before me. And I don't pretend to any special wisdom about what's happening. But that's the whole point, isn't it? I'm just one more person dying, trying to make sense of what I'm going through. . . . </i></p><p>Praise for <i>Not Fade Away</i></p><p>"This is a wise, funny, and intensely true book--a generous gift from an amazing guy to those of us who are so busy getting through life that we sometimes forget why we're living.

He lives in Ojai, California.</p><h2>Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals (Great Books in Philosophy)</h2><p>The nature and theoretical underpinnings of ethics have been an intellectual driving force animating the pursuits of great scholars. In The Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals (1785) Immanuel Kant, one of the most powerful philosophical minds of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, inquires into the true nature of morality.In rejecting the results or consequences of action as the foundation of moral judgments, he denies that good or bad effects have any relevance in the moral evaluation of human behavior. Instead, we must rely upon the Good Will for guidance. What is this Will upon which so much emphasis is placed, and how does it act as the foundation for behavior that can be assessed as truly moral? In this groundbreaking work, Kant outlines an ethical perspective that has been a vital force in the Western world.</p><p><b>IMMANUEL KANT</b>, born in K�nigsberg, East Prussia (in what is now Kaliningrad, Russia), on April 22, 1724, was reared by parents who were members of the Lutheran sect known as Pietists. Though his upbringing was religious, Kant did not find himself subjected to a dogmatic or doctrinaire home environment. After completing his early education at the Collegium Fridericianum, he entered the University of K�nigsberg in 1740 at the age of sixteen. Though it was originally thought that he would make the ministry his life&#x2019;s pursuit, Kant took the minimum number of required courses in theology and then dedicated himself to philosophy, mathematics, and physical science. During the years between 1746 and 1755 he worked as a private tutor in an effort to support himself through graduate work after the death of his parents left him without financial assistance. Receiving his doctorate in 1755, he taught at the University of K�nigsberg for fifteen years until 1770 when he was finally promoted to Professor of Logic and Metaphysics. Kant held this position until his death on February 12, 1804.&nbsp;<br><br>Among Kant&#x2019;s most important philosophical works are:&nbsp;<i>The Critique of Pure Reason</i>&nbsp;(1781),&nbsp;<i>Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics&nbsp;</i>(1783),<i>&nbsp;Idea for a Universal History</i>&nbsp;(1784),&nbsp;<i>Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals</i>&nbsp;(1785),&nbsp;<i>Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science</i>&nbsp;(1786),&nbsp;<i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>&nbsp;(1787),&nbsp;<i>Critique of Judgment&nbsp;</i>(1790),&nbsp;<i>Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone</i>&nbsp;(1793),&nbsp;<i>Perpetual Peace</i>&nbsp;(1795),&nbsp;<i>Metaphysics of Ethics&nbsp;</i>(1797), and&nbsp;<i>Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View&nbsp;</i>(1798).</p><h2>Death of a Peer</h2><p>Murder becomes a family affair...<br><br>The Lampreys were a charming, eccentric happy-go-lucky family, teetering on the edge of financial ruin.

In Texasville, the trio grew up to &#34;adultery and madness, bankruptcy and boom times,&#34; (New York Daily News). Now McMurtry takes his most colorful characters into their twilight years -- in an unforgettable end to the Thalia saga. Surrounded by his children, all of whom are going through tumultuous transitional times; his promiscuous wife, Karla, who is with her own demons; and his friend Sonny, who seems to be dying, Duane can&#39;t make sense of his life anymore. The stark realization that he has spent his whole life in a miserable dust-bowl town throws him into a protracted end-of-life crisis -- one that will hurtle him toward unexpected love, profoundly affect old friends, and cause him to embark on outlandish new beginning. McMurtry&#39;s strongest and most appealing contemporary novel since Terms of Endearment, Duane&#39;s Depressed is utterly unsentimental, often hilarious, sometimes tragic and shocking, and in the end full of hope.</p><p>At 62, ever-dependable oil man Duane Moore ditches his pickup and starts walking everywhere--deeply deviant behavior in one-stoplight Thalia, Texas. "It occurred to him one day--not in a flash, but through a process of seepage, a kind of gas leak into his consciousness--that most of his memories, from his first courtship to the lip of old age, involved the cabs of pickups," Larry McMurtry writes. Yet oddly enough, Duane's marriage, four children and nine grandchildren, his career highs and lows, all occurred when he was nowhere near his vehicle. Within days he has moved into his cabin on a hill, reacquired his dog, Shorty the Sixth ("an air of slight guilt was typical of all the Shortys"), and begun to think on these things. Of course, this brings on an additional problem: "He realized that for the first time in his life he had too much time to think; of course he had <i>wanted</i> more time to think, but that was probably because he hadn't realized how tricky thinking could be." <p> Luckily for readers, Duane's attempts to go off the grid are far from successful. Thus do we have the deep pleasures of his comical and complex encounters with his wife, Karla, and family, not to mention some of Thalia's singular citizens. As ever, McMurtry's dialogue and narration snaps and surprises. He makes his hero's solitude, and his increasing depression, infinitely intriguing. Will Duane's attempts to literally <i>and</i> figuratively cultivate his garden succeed? Will he forge his way through the three volumes of Proust that his attractive new psychiatrist has prescribed in lieu of Prozac? Will the catfish that has found its way into his waterbed survive? Answers to these and many other questions await you in <i>Duane's Depressed</i>, the final book of the marvelous trilogy McMurtry began with <i>The Last Picture Show</i> and <i>Texasville</i>. Let us pray that it turns into a quartet: we need far more of Duane and his family. For a start, his granddaughter Barbi--"a dark midge of a child"--merits a volume of her own. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>The winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, among other awards, <b>Larry McMurtry</b> is the author of twenty-two novels, including <i>Lonesome Dove, Terms of Endearment, The Evening Star, Buffalo Girls, The Late Child,</i> and <i>Comanche Moon.</i> He has also written two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays.

Corinne, Sarah&#39;s sister, struggles to get by. From Web site development to jewelry sales, none of the pies she has her thumb stuck in contains a plum worth pulling. No wonder Corinne envies Sarah. What she doesn&#39;t know is how jealous Sarah is of her. And what neither of them realizes is how their frantic drive for achievement is speeding them headlong past the things that matter most in life. So when their mother, Maggie, purchases plane tickets for them to join her in a vacation on the Gulf of Mexico, they almost decline the offer. But circumstances force the issue, and the sisters soon find themselves first thrown together, then ultimately drawn together, in one memorable week in a cabin called &#39;Seaside.&#39; As Maggie, a professional photographer, sets out to capture on film the faces and moods of her daughters, more than film develops. A picture emerges of possibilities that come only by slowing down and savoring the simple treasures of the moment. It takes a mother&#39;s love and honesty to teach her two daughters a wiser, uncluttered way of life---one that can bring peace to their hearts and healing to their relationship. And though the lesson comes on wings of grief, the sadness is tempered with faith, restoration, and a joy that comes from the hand of God. Seaside is a novella of the heart---poignant, gentle, true, offering an eloquent reminder that life is too precious a gift to be unwrapped in haste.</p><p>TERRI BLACKSTOCK is a popular novelist who has written for HarperCollins, Silhouette, Dell, and Harlequin.

Moore, America&#39;s First Civil Rights Martyr</h2><p>Part biography and part detective story, this examination of the life and still unsolved assassination of Harry Moore, a man who fought for racial equality in Florida well before the civil rights movement caught on, reveals two possibly bungled FBI investigations. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Before graduate student Mike King began using his given name, Martin Luther, before Detroit Red changed his name to Malcolm X, and before Medgar Evers joined the NAACP, civil rights activist Harry T. Moore was murdered. On Christmas night, 1951, an explosion ripped through his house, the bomb having been planted directly under his bed. His mother, visiting for the holidays, had been very concerned for Moore's safety. In the 1950s, in the Deep South, Moore's political activism had earned him plenty of enemies. "Every advancement comes by way of sacrifice," he told his mother before going to bed that night. "What I am doing is for the benefit of my race."<p> In the 1930s and '40s, Moore drove the roads of Florida, organizing the local NAACP, speaking quietly against Jim Crow laws, and urging blacks to register to vote. He also wrote elegantly argued letters to the governor and other public officials, protesting injustices and atrocities against blacks. Seen as a troublemaker, Moore became entangled with Willis McCall--whom author Ben Green calls "the prototype of the racist Southern sheriff." Green intertwines the biographies of these two very different men, drawing a picture of racial tension in an era before the issues reached national attention. Green is especially good at capturing the atmosphere of the events--dense fogs, sticky heat, clouds of biting insects--but goes slightly astray when listening to drunken former Klansmen, who are perhaps merely seeking their 15 minutes of fame and not unburdening their souls before they die, as they spout confessions about Moore's murder. Like many biographers, Green clearly admires his subject, which makes him write slightly purple prose. Moore's life, however, was clearly admirable and Green has written a moving tribute to this sadly forgotten man. <i>--C.B. Delaney</i></p>In Jim Crow Florida, a young black man&#x2019;s courageous fight to obtain equal rights for blacks ends in a personal tragedy that remains unsolved to this day. This is his story.&nbsp;&#x201c;We can only share the author&#x2019;s admiration for his subject&#x2019;s singular achievement. . . . Green has performed a valuable service in bringing attention once more to this courageous man.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;A gifted storyteller and a tenacious investigator, Ben Green uncovers a remarkable and heartbreaking tale that has been buried for fifty years.&#x201d;&#x2014;Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Harvard University&nbsp;Before Martin Luther King Jr. began to preach from his pulpit in Montgomery, before the landmark <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> decision, and before Rosa Parks' famous bus ride, a man named Harry T. Moore toiled in Jim Crow Florida on behalf of the NAACP and the Progressive Voters&#x2019; League. For seventeen years, in an era of official indifference and outright hostility, the soft-spoken but resolute Moore traveled the back roads of the state on a mission to educate, evangelize, and organize. On Christmas night in 1951, in Mims, Florida, a bomb placed under his bed ended Harry Moore&#x2019;s life. His wife, Harriette, died of her wounds a week later.&nbsp;Although Florida&#x2019;s governor reopened the case in 1991, no one was ever convicted of this crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using previously unavailable FBI files, Green introduces his readers to the good and the bad, the villainous and the virtuous, in Jim Crow Florida. In doing so, he offers a poignant and gripping memorial to the pioneering work of Harry T. Moore, one of the earliest martyrs of the modern civil rights movement.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><h2>Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion and Purpose</h2><p>[ Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose; A Round Table Comic Hsieh, Tony ( Author ) ] { Paperback } 2012</p><p><p>The visionary CEO of Zappos explains how an emphasis on corporate culture can lead to unprecedented success.</p> <p>Pay new employees $2000 to quit.

In the book you say, "I've been an entrepreneur for most of my life." Do you think people are born entrepreneurs or do they become them?</b> <p>I think usually by the time you're 12 years old, you either have the entrepreneurial spirit or you don't. I would describe the entrepeneurial spirit as a combination of creativity and optimisim.</p> <b>2. Could you name one particular experience that inspired you to create a company devoted to customer happiness?</b> <p>For me, it's really been driven by daily examples of bad customer service in my everyday personal life.</p> <b>3. Was the worm farm really the invaluable catalyst for forming your business and life philosophy?</b> <p>My parents tell me that as a kid I was always trying to come up with different business ideas. The idea of starting a worm farm is my earliest memory of a business idea.</p> <b>4. You say that you have always been an avid book reader. What are your favorite books?

You seem to have taken risks with business ideas a lot while growing up. How do you recognize a risk that you shouldn't take?</b> <p>I think it just comes down to really breaking down what the worst case scenario actually is. For most of us, we're lucky to live in a time and in a society where we aren't actually ever in danger of dying from starvation or lack of shelter. Most of us have friends whose couches we can crash on in the worst case scenario, so any "risk" we take in starting a company isn't actually that big a risk.</p>Tony Hsieh became involved with Zappos as an advisor and investor in 1999, about two months after the company was founded.

Keith is the president and CEO of Carlson Keith Corporation in Honolulu.The Paradoxical Commandments took on a life of their own after Keith wrote them as a Harvard sophomore more than 30 years ago. They became almost a law unto themselves for doing good despite people and circumstances. They were used by religious leaders across the globe, including Mother Teresa, to illustrate truths found in the Christian Bible. Now Keith writes his third book on the Paradoxical Commandments, this time relating them to Christian faith and the Bible. Keith, a person of faith himself, knows that people search for meaningful lives, and he uses his Paradoxical Commandments to help provide such meaning. Each chapter lists the commandment, then draws on a teaching of Jesus or other figures in the Christian Bible to help explain it. He uses the biblical stories of the prodigal son, David, Moses, Job and the "good Samaritan," among others, to illustrate the commandments. Keith's presentation is simple and straightforward, his links between each commandment and the Bible easy to understand if a bit obvious. This is a pleasing introduction to the Paradoxical Commandments, as well as an easy-to-swallow introduction to the Christian Scriptures. Study guides for each chapter move into deeper discussion and reflection. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There is not an advocate, a festival performer or a fur coat in sight as, with bitter passion and rancid humour, Welsh lays bare the lives of this ill-starred bunch of addicts, alcoholics and no-hopers.</p><p>Irvine Welsh&#39;s controversial first novel, set on the heroin-addicted fringe of working-class youth in Edinburgh, is yet another exploration of the dark side of Scottishness. The main character, Mark Renton, is at the center of a clique of nihilistic slacker junkies with no hopes and no possibilities, and only &#34;mind-numbing and spirit-crushing&#34; alternatives in the straight world they despise. This particular slice of humanity has nothing left but the blackest of humor and a sharpness of wit. American readers can use the glossary in the back to translate the slang and dialect--essential, since the dialogue makes the book. This is a bleak vision sung as musical comedy.Trainspotting is the novel that launched the sensational career of Irvine Welsh - an authentic, unrelenting, and strangely exhilarating group portrait of blasted lives in Edinburgh that has the linguistic energy of A Clockwork Orange and the literary impact of Last Exit to Brooklyn. Rents, Sick Boy, Mother Superior, Swanney, Spuds, and Begbie are as unforgettable a clutch of rude boys, junkies, and nutters as readers will ever encounter.</p><h2>Shotgun Guide (Field &amp; Stream): Shotgun Skills You Need</h2><p>From the most trusted brand in outdoor sports, <i>Field &amp; Stream</i>, this book is drawn from the <i>Total Gun Manual</i>, the latest in the top-selling series that began with <i>The Total Outdoorsman</i> (200,000 copies in print!).

They are creating objects to satisfy none but their own standards of technique and aesthetics, following a desire shared by many people for one-of-a-kind objects that truly represent an extension of individual personality. <br><br> Some of these artist-craftsmen make functional pieces, such as vases and bowls; others create objects meant to satisfy solely on an aesthetic level. Yet, though their materials and the techniques they were made by vary, common to all the objects is their individual creation from start to finish by the artist. This new crafts movement is rapidly spreading throughout the United States, and the handcrafted object has been elevated to a new status.<br><br> OBJECTS:USA is a comprehensive survey of this movement, and it illustrates a cross section of over 300 examples from the various crafts media: plastics; enamels; mosaics; wood; blown and stained glass; metal; jewelry; and hooked, woven, knitted, and sculptured fibers. With his selection of examples created by more than 250 of the most talented artist-craftsmen living in the United States, Lee Nordness gives a valuable general history of American crafts. Because each object is so closely associated with the artist himself, the author also includes photographs of each craftsman represented in the book, with a brief biography and description of the significance of his work. In addition, many of the artists have contributed statements on their aims and methods of working.</p><p></p><h2>Scouting for Boys: A Handbook for Instruction in Good Citizenship (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>A startling amalgam of Zulu war-cry and Sherlock Holmes, of practical tips on health and hygiene and object lessons in woodcraft, <em>Scouting for Boys</em> (1908) is the original blueprint and inspiration for the Boy Scout Movement. An all-time bestseller in the English-speaking world, second in its heyday only to the Bible, it is one of the most influential manuals for youth ever published, known and loved around the world.<br> Including all of Baden-Powell's original illustrations, this new critical edition of <em>Scouting for Boys</em> serves up a wonderful hodge-podge of true crime stories, stern moralizing, stock adventure tales, natural history, first-aid tips, advice on observation and tracking, and much more. Readers will find a roughly composed pastiche of jingoist lore and tracker legend, padded with lengthy quotations from adventure fiction--from Rudyard Kipling and James Fenimore Cooper, to Alexander Dumas and Arthur Conan Doyle--and seamed through with the multiple anxieties of its time: fears of degeneration ("the fall of the Roman empire was due to bad citizenship") and a constant worry over imminent war. Alongside practical instructions on how to light fires, build a boat, or stalk animals (or men), it includes sections on chivalry, self-discipline, self-improvement, and citizenship. Indeed, the book brims with Baden-Powell's philosophy of life, one that replaces self with service, puts country before the individual, and duty above all. The introduction by Elleke Boehmer illuminates the book's maverick complexity and her notes clarify obscure references.<br> Though almost a century old, <em>Scouting for Boys</em> continues to fascinate, surprise, and motivate readers today. It will delight anyone interested in popular culture, Victorian history, and literature for children.</p><p><br><strong>Elleke Boehmer</strong> is Professor of Colonial and Post-Colonial Literature at Nottingham Trent University. She is the author of many books and articles on postcolonial writing and theory. She has also written short stories and three novels, most recently <em>Bloodlines</em>.<br><br>"<em>Scouting for Boys</em> was written in the spirit of <em>Peter Pan</em> and Kipling's <em>Kim</em>; the games and plays and campfire stories are full of good ideas and good fun. The chapters on tracking, woodcraft, camp life and chivalry are full of simple (sometimes lifesaving) bits of practical information and exercises that teach children how to be observant, courteous and innovative."--<em>Los Angeles Times</em><p></p><br>"Reissued for the first time...the original <em>Scouting for Boys</em> includes plenty of quaint language and chuckle-worthy advice. But for all its anachronisms, Baden-Powell's blueprint for what became a worldwide movement remains strangely resonant with our own times."--<em>U.S. News and World Report</em><p></p><br>"Baden Powell had charm and courage, and a knack with the young, and he could draw excellent freehand illustrations. All these qualities are evident in this best-selling manual of 1908, now cleverly reissued by Oxford University Press. It's one of the very few books of the twentieth century that actually led to the formation of a worldwide movement."--Christopher Hitchens, <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em><p></p><br>"A fine and intriguing vision of threatened Anglo-American masculinity at the crisis and crest of empire. It's also a hoot."--<em>Chicago Tribune</em><p></p><br>"A flash-frozen, perfectly preserved moment in time, effectively conveying the sense and character of the Edwardian era, rendered not only readable, but delivering a surprisingly pleasant kick through Baden-Powell's vivid, gee-whiz prose."--<em>San Diego Union Tribune</em><p></p><br>"Edited, annotated and introduced by Elleke Boehmer, professor of colonial and post-colonial literature at Nottingham Trent University in England, this fascinating volume tells us a lot about Baden-Powell, his movement and even to some extent the particular point in time when scouting was born."--<em>Washington Times</em><p></p><br>"The overall impression left by <em>Scouting for Boys</em> is, as it was intended to be, bracing. Through this book, untold millions of boys have been led to healthy and harmless fun, acquiring some solid moral and practical instruction along the way. It is easy to smile now at the book's author, at his enthusiasm for pastimes like pig-sticking and skirt-dancing, his snobbery and imperialism, his determined repression of his own sexuality, whatever it was. It is not so easy to discount his achievement. Baden-Powell was nominated for the 1939 Nobel Peace Prize. The matter fell through because of the war; but looking through the list of subsequent recipients of that award, I doubt there is even one who did as much good in the world as the author of <em>Scouting for Boys</em>."--<em>New York Sun</em><p></p><br>"This new edition is a delight for fathers who once were or now have Boy Scouts, and a remarkable look into the mind of an unusual man and the culture that influenced him.... Baden-Powell's call for both boys (and girls) to be their best and 'do a good turn daily' remains compelling, and the stories, games, and skills he writes about are as stirring to the boyish soul as they were a century ago."--<em>Book Page</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Surprised by the Voice of God: How God Speaks Today Through Prophecies, Dreams, and Visions</h2><p>Throughout the time of the Bible, God spoke through prophecies, dreams and visions. After an intense period of study, Deere became convinced that God still speaks today apart from the Bible--but never in contradiction to it. In this provocative book full of stories and personal accounts, Deere reveals some of these surprising ways God communicates with us.</p><p>This inspiring and balanced look at what the Bible says about the ways God communicates will lead readers into a more intimate and effective walk with God.Jack Deere, formerly an associate professor of Old Testament at Dallas Theological Seminary, is a writer, lecturer, and author of the best-selling Surprised by the Power of the Spirit.

Lee Through His Private Letters</h2><p>Published to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the Confederate general&#39;s birth, a portrait based on his unpublished personal correspondence offers insight into the lesser-known complexities of his personality, in a collection of essays that covers such topics as Lee&#39;s early years, his relationships with family and slaves, and his thoughts on military strategy.</p><p><b>Elizabeth Brown Pryor</b> has combined careers as an award-winning historian and senior diplomat in the American Foreign Service, most recently as a senior adviser to the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe of the U.S. Congress.

Paul Jeffers has written more than forty fiction and nonfiction books, including several history books on Theodore Roosevelt. He lives in New York City.Reader Raymond Todd, like his subject, President Grover Cleveland, remains stodgy and proper as he renders a weighty and instructive period of American history, the latter part of the 1800s. Todd lowers his already low voice and modifies his inflection to quote Cleveland, an important feature in a biography with many quotations. Believed to have weighed 300 pounds, the rotund statesman was called "Uncle Jumbo" by his family, and we hear many examples of his speaking and writing in "polysyllabic profundities." The honest man survives a secret and wide excision of an oral cancer aboard a yacht on the Potomac, but not running a Democratic administration during the depression of 1893.

She lives in Texas with her husband, three children, and an assortment of pets.&#x201c; &#x2019;Tis madness!&#x201d; Bowen Montgomery exclaimed. &#x201c;He cannot tie you to the wee daft daughter of our most hated foe.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Graeme Montgomery stared grimly back at his brother, unable to formulate a response for the growing rage in his chest. The king&#x2019;s messenger had departed and was even now riding beyond the Montgomery border. Graeme had made sure of it. He felt deeply betrayed by his king and wanted no representative of the crown on his lands for a second longer.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s but a child,&#x201d; Bowen said in disgust. &#x201c;And she&#x2019;s . . . she&#x2019;s . . . well, everyone knows she isn&#x2019;t right. What the hell are you supposed to do with her, Graeme?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Graeme held up his hand for silence and his fi ngers trembled, betraying his fury. He turned and stalked away from his brother, needing the distance and solitude to take in the magnitude of what had just been done to him. To his clan.<br> &nbsp;<br> His king hadn&#x2019;t just made a simple decree of marriage in an effort to halt hostilities between two feuding clans. He&#x2019;d effectively chosen to end Graeme&#x2019;s chance to pass the mantle of leadership on to his heirs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Because there wouldn&#x2019;t be any.<br> &nbsp;<br> It would all end with Graeme.<br> &nbsp;<br> With no sons to become laird, it would be up to one of his brothers&#x2014;Bowen or Teague&#x2014;to assume the role and provide heirs so that the Montgomery name would be carried into the future. His clan might even decide that one of his brothers would be a better choice for laird simply because he would be in a position of having a wife who couldn&#x2019;t assume her role in the clan and he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to sire children.<br> &nbsp;<br> What a damnable mess the whole thing was.<br> &nbsp;<br> How could his liege have done this? Surely he understood the future he was consigning Graeme to.<br> &nbsp;<br> He paced into the small antechamber down the narrow hallway from the great hall. The room was darkened, the furs not yet thrown back from the windows. He chose to leave them covered and instead lit a candle from one of the wall sconces in the hallway.<br> &nbsp;<br> The glow from the candle did little to illuminate the room, but he found his way to the sturdy table where his da had sat many a night scratching his quill over ledgers. The old laird had been a tightfisted, scrutinizing man who held into account every thing of value owned by the clan.<br> &nbsp;<br> But he had a heart the size of a mountain and he was fair and equal with his clan. He made sure everyone had what they needed. All were clothed and no one went hungry even if it meant he, himself, went without.<br> &nbsp;<br> Graeme missed him every single day.<br> &nbsp;<br> He sank heavily into the gnarled chair and ran his hands over the aged wood, almost as if he could feel the essence of his father in this very room.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marriage. To an Armstrong. It didn&#x2019;t bear thinking about.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then there was Bowen with all his babbling about the girl being daft. Graeme hadn&#x2019;t ever paid much heed to the rumors about the lass being touched. It hadn&#x2019;t concerned him. Not until now. It was widely known that something was off about the girl and that the Armstrong clan had closed ranks around her.<br> &nbsp;<br> She&#x2019;d even been betrothed before, to the McHugh whelp. The McHugh chieftain coveted an alliance with the Armstrongs, because once allied with them, he became a force to be reckoned with. There was no love lost between the Montgomerys and McHughs. The McHughs were every bit as culpable in the death of Graeme&#x2019;s father, but Graeme knew who&#x2019;d been directly responsible. And so it was the Armstrongs who were most deserving of his hatred.<br> &nbsp;<br> He hadn&#x2019;t been sorry that the betrothal had been dissolved and that the two clans weren&#x2019;t formally bound by marriage. The Armstrongs weren&#x2019;t quick to ally themselves with neighboring clans. They didn&#x2019;t need to. They were a powerful enough force that unless many other clans stood against them, they would be assured a victory in battle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tavis Armstrong was just as his father was before him. Mistrustful of treaties and promises. He gave no one opportunity to betray him and he trusted his clan&#x2019;s welfare to no one save himself.<br> &nbsp;<br> If they weren&#x2019;t such bitter enemies, Graeme could almost respect the vigor with which Tavis wielded his power and the fact that he relied on no one for support.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once the betrothal had been dissolved between the Armstrong daughter and McHugh&#x2019;s son, not much else was said, other than the occasional murmurs that called into question the lass&#x2019;s state of mind. Since the Armstrongs weren&#x2019;t exactly a social clan, and they most definitely held to their own, not much escaped about the only daughter.<br> &nbsp;<br> No, Graeme wasn&#x2019;t sorry that the marriage hadn&#x2019;t taken place. He knew that McHugh would use his position with Armstrong to feed the fury against the Montgomerys. McHugh wanted more land, more power, and the Montgomery holding was a thorn in his side because they had him boxed in to the north.<br> &nbsp;<br> But now he was going to be saddled with a woman he knew next to nothing about? It was bad enough she was addled and couldn&#x2019;t perform as a wife, but she was an Armstrong, which meant no matter if she was the most perfect woman in all of the highlands, Graeme wanted nothing to do with her.<br> &nbsp;<br> When he married, it would be to a lass of his own clan. He&#x2019;d never marry someone who would bring danger, anger, and dissension to his people. And Eveline Armstrong would certainly do just that.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Graeme?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The small whisper came from the doorway, and some of his anger and tension fl ed as his sister, Rorie, peered in, her expression anxious.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What is it, sweeting?&#x201d; he asked, motioning her forward.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rorie was fifteen winters, but she was behind most other lasses her age. While most had found their womanly shapes and had grown breasts, Rorie was still thin and slight, and were it not for her startling beautiful green eyes and the delicate femininity of her face, she could well pass for a lad.<br> &nbsp;<br> With three older brothers, one would think she would have grown up able to take on anything, but she was extremely shy, quieter than any lass of his acquaintance. Except around him and his brothers. With them she was bossy, demanding, and impish. She mostly avoided the rest of the clan and preferred to go her own way.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is it true what Bowen said?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She was but a few feet away now, standing in front of the table where he sat, his hands still clenched into fists as they rested on the wooden surface.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are you marrying an Armstrong?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He searched her expression for fear because he&#x2019;d do anything to soothe her worries. Losing their father had been especially difficult for her because she had been his da&#x2019;s treasure. She more than any of them viewed the Armstrongs as monsters.<br> &nbsp;<br> But all he saw was a troubled, worried look in her expressive eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;&#x2019;Tis what the king has decreed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She frowned. &#x201c;But why? Why would he do such a thing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not your place to question his dictates,&#x201d; he said with no heat. He couldn&#x2019;t reprimand her for such a lack of respect when he himself questioned the very thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They killed Da,&#x201d; she said emphatically. &#x201c;How can there ever be peace between us? How could the king believe that forcing a marriage between you and one of them would solve anything?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Shhh,&#x201d; he said gently. &#x201c;Enough, Rorie. We&#x2019;ve been summoned to the Armstrongs and there we&#x2019;ll go.&#x201d;<br> Her look of horror was instantaneous. &#x201c;Go there? To their lands? Where they could kill us all? Why can&#x2019;t they come here? Why are we the ones who must sacrifice everything? Have they done something to gain the king&#x2019;s favor?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> For a moment Graeme smiled, finding amusement in her statement. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not likely they feel that handing their daughter over to me in marriage is the result of gaining his favor. I doubt they have any more liking for the matter than we do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c; &#x2019;Tis said she&#x2019;s touched,&#x201d; Rorie asserted.<br> &nbsp;<br> Graeme sighed. &#x201c;I guess we&#x2019;ll fi nd out at the wedding, now won&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Just then, Teague&#x2019;s bellow could be heard down the hallway. &#x201c;Graeme! God&#x2019;s teeth, where are you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Graeme sighed again. Rorie spared a slight smile and turned just as Teague burst through the door, sweat and blood caked on his body.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tell me it isn&#x2019;t true,&#x201d; Teague spat.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You left training to ask if what Bowen told you was truth?&#x201d; Graeme asked. &#x201c;Are you suggesting he would lie to you and that you should leave your duties to question me on such a thing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Teague scowled and started to say something, but stopped, only just now realizing Rorie was in attendance. He clamped his lips shut, then glanced down at the blood covering him<br> &nbsp;<br> Rorie was . . . well, she was different. To most of the women of their clan, blood, violence, battle . . . It was all a way of life. As normal as eating and sleeping. But Rorie was sensitive to such things. The sight of blood made her go pale, and she hated to hear any sounds of pain or violence.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>English Country House Interiors</h2><p>A highly detailed look at the English country house interior, offering unprecedented access to England&#x2019;s finest rooms.

David Peat went to a Blackfoot Sun Dance ceremony. Having spent all of his life steeped in and influenced by linear Western science, he was entranced by the Native American worldview and, through dialogue circles between scientists and native elders, he began to explore it in greater depth. Blackfoot Physics is the account of his discoveries. In an edifying synthesis of anthropology, history, metaphysics, cosmology, and quantum theory, Peat compares the medicines, the myths, the languages--the entire perceptions of reality of the Western and indigenous peoples. What becomes apparent is the amazing resemblance between indigenous teachings and some of the insights that are emerging from modern science, a congruence that is as enlightening about the physical universe as it is about the circular evolution of humanity&#39;s understanding. Through Peat&#39;s insightful observations, he extends our understanding of ourselves, our understanding of the universe, and how the two intersect in a meaningful vision of human life in relation to a greater reality.</p><p>F.

But Billy&#x2019;s tour takes an unexpected turn when the squid suddenly and impossibly vanishes into thin air.<br><br>As Billy soon discovers, this is the precipitating act in a struggle to the death between mysterious but powerful forces in a London whose existence he has been blissfully ignorant of until now, a city whose denizens&#x2014;human and otherwise&#x2014;are adept in magic and murder.<br><br>There is the Congregation of God Kraken, a sect of squid worshippers whose roots go back to the dawn of humanity&#x2014;and beyond.

At first, the adjective seems vaguely simpering, as if these ambassadors of alterity are in fact safe, unthreatening, cuddly. But immediately comes a strangeness. If they are a, no, <em>the</em> soft intelligence, what are we? <em>Hard</em> intelligence? Soft <em>un</em>intelligence? Why are they soft intelligence <em>singular</em>? Is each but an iteration of some tentacular totality? What strange sentience. An opaque collective.</p> <p>There are rules to this exercise. No invented species nor chimerical monsters--though this doesn't preclude gigantism nor a little taxonomic vagueness. Thus the 'huge, brown, glistening bulk' of William Hope Hodgson's 'mighty devil-fish' in <em>The Boats of the 'Glen Carrig'</em> would be permissible: <em>haploteuthis ferox</em>, that hitherto unknown squid that assailed the English coast in H.G. Wells's <em>The Sea Raiders</em> is not: still less would be Cthulhu, despite his admirably tentacular visage. And as the effort here is to overturn a few rocks less jostled to see what coils beneath, much celebrated ceph-lit has been left alone. Captain Nemo's nemesis is not here. Benchley's <em>Beast</em> is absent, as is Lautr�amont's octopus spirit from <em>Maldoror</em>. The astounding ruminations on the octopus-as-bad-ontology in Victor Hugo's otherwise 'prodigiously boring book' (Sebald) <em>Toilers of the Sea</em>, remain indispensable--but elsewhere.</p> See China Mi�ville's full list of underrated literary cephalopods at Omnivoracious, Amazon.com's books blogIn such novels as Perdido Street Station and the groundbreaking SF thriller The City &amp; The City, China Mieville has astonished and delighted an ever-growing body of readers. In Kraken, he gives us his most absorbing creation to date, an eschatological epic that reaffirms his position as the foremost urban fantasist of the modern era.The story begins with the impossible disappearance of Architeuthis Dux&#x2014; a gigantic squid &#x2013; from London&#x2019;s Natural History Museum. To some, that squid is simply a bizarre natural phenomenon. To others, it is an enigmatic divinity and a harbinger of the End of Days. The drama that arises from its disappearance illuminates the varied array of magical forces that live&#x2014;have always lived&#x2014;beneath the quotidian surface of London. The result is a visionary narrative of men and their gods, of magic, murder, and apocalypse. Densely imagined, enormously funny, and filled with unforgettable images, Kraken is a work of baroque grandeur and great originality that only China Mieville could have written.</p><h2>Look I&#39;m an Engineer (Look!

Tracy Beach, in her extensive research, found mountains of information from sources never before tapped to uncover a woman who was self sufficient, courageous, and driven. The book reads like a novel with dialog from interviews of Laura by Fred Mazzulla and others, but every word is factual and from reliable sources.<br><br>If you love Colorado history you'll find this book full of new information about Laura's generosity and compassion for all who had dealings with her. And you'll laugh at the many colorful encounters as she grew in prominence throughout Colorado. Includes numerous historical photographs of Laura and her girls.</p><p>Tracy Beach, a Colorado historian and author of <i>The Tunnels Under Our Feet: Colorado's Forgotten Hollow Sidewalks</i> (also published by Johnson Books) was raised in Salida the small Colorado town that Laura called home for fifty-three years and was determined to give this wonderful woman her final wish a biography of her amazing life.Laura Evens story, "My Life as a Whore" is best nonfiction reviewer has read. <br><br>"My Life as a Whore: The Biography of Madam Laura Evens" by Canon City author Tracy Beach is, without a doubt, the best written, best researched and best illustrated nonfiction book I have ever had the privilege of reading.<br><br>Beach, a former Salidan, has a passion for history, and in telling the tale of Salida's infamous madam, who owned most of the local "red light district" until 1949, she brings Laura Evens to life, telling much of the story in Evens' own words. --Arlene Shovald, Special to the Mountain Mall and The Chaffee County Times<br><br>Colorado historian Tracy Beach has recently published the biography of one of Colorado s most colorful and entrepreneurial Red Light District proprietors, <i>My Life as a Whore: The Biography of Madam Laura Evens, 1871-1953</i> (Johnson Books, $18.95). Forthright, provocative and straight forward, Beach has written one of the best biographies of a Western madam since Max Evans <i>Madame Millie</i>. Well researched and documented, with numerous photographs, Beach's biography of Laura Evans does not leave the story in the 19th century, but actually brings the story well into the 20th century, documenting the history of her life as a prostitute, her trials and tribulations managing a house of prostitution until 1949, and the challenges of a woman owning her own business through the end of the frontier West, two world wars, Prohibition and the Great Depression. Beach's research also provides an excellent local history of the history of brothels, and their role in the economy and society of Leadville, Denver, Central City and Salida, Colorado. It is available for purchase at BigEarthPublishing.com. --Stuart Rosebrook, True West Magazine<br><br>Tracy Beach s latest book, <i>My Life as a Whore: The Biography of Madam Laura Evens, 1871-1953</i>, brings to life the story of one of Colorado's infamous madams. Beach used interviews with Evens and her employees conducted by the popular Colorado historian, Max Mazzulla, in the 1940s and early 1950s. The author supplements these firsthand accounts with notes from her own interviews with people who knew Evens, and with facts about the lives of prostitutes from well-known secondary sources. Evens, who worked as a parlor-house prostitute in Leadville and Denver, eventually became a madam in Central City and Salida, Colorado. The title of the book hints at the frankness with which Evens's story is told: Laura herself did not like euphemisms such as "soiled dove" and "lady of the evening." She talked about what she did in down-to-earth language, and pulled no punches. --Catherine Holder Spude, author of <i>Saloons, Prostitutes, and Temperance in Alaska Territory</i></p><h2>Do It Yourself Bonefishing</h2><p>Do It Yourself Bonefishing is the authoritative guide written for DIY anglers targeting bonefish on the fly.

She opened Connie&#x2019;s Pizza and settled into her chosen community, wanting to be herself, content to lead a small group of paramedics, doctors, nurses and chaplains who were studying the scriptures and sharing their experiences from across the Chicago area. Ryan Cooper, CEO of a religious-affiliated private hospital, had seen too many of Chicago&#x2019;s children die from gun violence, young mothers die from cancer, and random illness take both the young and old.

In addition to the focus on the aftermath of Brown's raid, Odinga's story revolves around her personal issues, including her fractured relationship with her daughter, and the very public loss of her husband. The 19th and 20th century storylines don't completely mesh, with little to indicate how the changes introduced by Brown's success would result in Odinga's world of the 1950s. Civil War buffs and alternate history fans will both enjoy the proposals Bisson advances, even if he doesn't provide the necessary extrapolation. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

How welcome, then, is the Handbook of Good Psychiatric Management for Borderline Personality Disorder, which teaches clinicians what to do and how to do it, as well as what not to do and how to avoid it. The author, a renowned researcher and clinician, has developed a new evidence-based treatment, Good Psychiatric Management (GPM) that comfortably utilizes cognitive, behavioral, and psychodynamic interventions that are practical and simple to implement. Because psychoeducation is an important component of GPM, the book teaches clinicians how to educate their patients about BPD, including the role of genetics and the expected course of the disease. This approach offers advantages both to practitioners, who become more adept at honest communication, and to patients, who are encouraged to have realistic hopes and to focus on strategies for coping with BPD in daily life. The book is structured for maximum learning, convenience, and utility, with an impressive array of features. - Section I provides background on BPD, including the myths that sometimes discourage clinicians from treating these patients and that hamper the effective treatment of the disorder.- Section II, the GPM Manual, provides a condensed and clear description of the most essential and specific GPM interventions that clinicians can learn from and use in everyday practice.- Section III, the GPM Workbook, offers case vignettes which reference chapters from the manual. Each vignette has a number of &#34;decision points&#34; where alternative interventions are proposed and discussed. - To further facilitate learning, a set of nine interactions is found in a series of online video demonstrations. Here, readers can see in vivo illustrations of the GPM model in practice.- Finally, a set of appendices provides critical information, such as a comparison of GPM with other evidence-based treatments of BPD, scaling risk and response strategies, and family guidelines. Designed to be a basic case management text for all hospital, outpatient clinic, or office-based psychiatrists or mental health professionals who assume primary responsibility for the treatment of those with BPD, the Handbook of Good Psychiatric Management for Borderline Personality Disorder constitutes a breakthrough in the treatment of these often misunderstood patients.</p><p><p>The Handbook of Good Psychiatric Management for Borderline Personality Disorder is based on the author's conviction that with adequate training most psychiatrists and other mental health professionals can become "good enough" to treat most borderline patients competently without having to refer them to more specialized care. Gunderson, considered the premier authority on the treatment of borderline personality disorder, recognizes that many clinicians remain hesitant to engage patients with BPD. However, because those with the disorder represent about 20% of inpatient and outpatient clinic patients, they require and deserve quality care. This book is a complete guide to using the evidence-based Good Psychiatric Management (GPM) approach for the treatment of BPD. The book demystifies the disorder, supplying the background, treatment guidelines, illustrative case studies, and online video demonstrations of core techniques needed by clinical psychiatrists, psychiatry residents, psychiatric nurses, and others who encounter borderline patients in clinical settings to deliver effective, pragmatic and non-intensive therapeutic care.</p><p>Common-sensical and evidence-based, the Handbook of Good Psychiatric Management for Borderline Personality Disorder prepares clinicians to help these patients understand their inner experience, reshape their behavior, and establish constructive lives. This success in turn instills confidence in treatment providers and eliminates the barriers that have heretofore hampered effective treatment.</p>John G.

She lives in the South with her family.<b>Prologue</b><p><i>The Desert, Far from Caldwell, N.Y. or Boston, M.A. or... sanity.</i></p><p>Some two years after the fact, when Jim Heron was no longer in special ops, he would reflect that Isaac Rothe, Matthias the Fucker and he, himself, had all changed their lives the night that bomb went off in the sand.</p><p>Of course, at the time, none of them knew what it all meant, or where it was all going. But that was life: nobody got a guided tour to their own theme park. You had to get on the rides as they presented themselves, never knowing whether you would like the one you were in line for... or if the bastard was going to make you throw up your corn dog and your cotton candy all over the place.</p><p>Maybe that was a good thing, though. Like back then he would have believed he&#x2019;d end up duking it out with a demon, trying to save the world from damnation? </p><p>Come on now.</p><p>But that night, in the dry cold that washed in the second the sun went down over the dunes, he and his boss had walked into a minefield... and only one had walked out.</p><p>The other? Not so much...</p><p>&#x201c;This is it,&#x201d; Matthias said as they came up to an abandoned village.</p><p>They were fifteen miles northwest from where they were staying in a barracks of Army boys. Being in XOps, they were outside the stream of defined corps which worked to their benefit: soldiers like him carried I.D.s from all branches of the service and used them whenever it suited.</p><p>The &#x201c;village&#x201d; was more like four crumbling stone structures and bunch of wood and tarp huts. As they approached, his green night vision goggles tracked movement all over the place. He hated those fucking tarps- they flapped in the wind, their shadows darting around like fast-footed people who had guns. And grenades. And other varieties of sharp and shiny.</p><p>Or in this case grungy and gritty.</p><p>He hated desert assignments; better to kill in civilization. More exposure, true- but at least you had a shot at knowing what was coming at you. Out here, people had resources he was unfamiliar with and that always made him twitchy as fuck.</p><p>&#x2018;Course, no one wanted to get their balls blown off. So most people felt like he did, including the enemy.</p><p>Plus he didn&#x2019;t trust the man he was with. Yeah, Matthias was his boss. Yeah, he&#x2019;d trained with the guy way back when. Yeah, he&#x2019;d been under him for the last decade.</p><p>But all of that just made him more certain he didn&#x2019;t want to be alone with the big man- and yet here they were, at a &#x201c;village&#x201d; in the fine township of Nowhere-Anyone-Could Find-A-Body-ville.</p><p>A gust of wind went Nike across the flat landscape, sprinting over the sand, picking up those tiny little particles, carrying all of them right smack into the collar of his digi-fatigues. And beneath his black, lace-up boots, the ground was constantly shifting, as if he were an ant walking across the back of a giant and irritating the piss out of the bastard.</p><p>You began to feel that at any minute, a great palm could come down of the sky and flatten you.</p><p>The meeting had been Matthias&#x2019;s idea. Something that couldn&#x2019;t be discussed anywhere else. So naturally, Jim had worn a Kevlar vest and about forty pounds of weapons. Along with water. MRE&#x2019;s.</p><p>He was a pack animal for real.</p><p>&#x201c;Over here,&#x201d; Matthias said, ducking into the door-less entry of one of the stone structures.</p><p>Jim paused and looked around. Nothing but tarps doing the running man as far as he knew. </p><p>He got out both his guns before going inside. Bottom-line? This was the perfect locale for a forcible inquisition. He had no idea what he&#x2019;d done or what he&#x2019;d learn to warrant it, but one thing he was clear on- there was no reason to run. If that was the reason he&#x2019;d been brought here, he was going to go in and find another two or three XOps guys in there to work him over while Matthias asked the question. If he bolted? They&#x2019;d just hunt him down in the desert even if took weeks.</p><p>Maybe that was why Isaac Rothe had showed up this afternoon with Matthias&#x2019;s prot�g� and second in command, Ezekiel. That pair were straight up killers, a couple of bit bulls ready to go for anyone&#x2019;s throat.</p><p>Yup, this made sense and he should have figured it out sooner. But even if he had, there was no getting anyway from a reckoning. No one got out of XOps alive. Not the operatives, not the fringe-playing Intel guys, not the bosses, either. Die with your boots on was the way you lived- not that you knew that going in.</p><p>And the thing was, he had been thinking of ways to get out. Killing people for a living was all he knew how to do, but it was starting to fuck with his head. Maybe Matthias had somehow figured that out.</p><p>Time to the face the music, Jim thought as he went through the doorway with both his guns up.</p><p>Might as well give &#x2019;em a fight-</p><p>Just Matthias. No one else.</p><p>Jim slowly lowered his guns and looked around the cramp space just to make sure. Turned out, it was true: According to his night goggles, there was just the man and no one else. With a flick of a switch, he went to heat seeking mode. Nothing but Matthias. Still.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; he demanded.</p><p>Matthias was over in the far corner, about ten feet away. When the man&#x2019;s hands came up from his sides, Jim flipped his weapons back into firing position... but all his boss did was shake his head and loosen up his gun belt. A quick toss and it was in the sand.</p><p>And then he opened his mouth and said something softly&#x2014;</p><p><b>###################################</b></p><p>Jim came back to consciousness sometime later. The explosion had thrown him against the stone wall, knocking him cold, and going by how stiff he was, he could have been out for a while.</p><p>After a couple minutes of what-the-fuck, he sat up cautiously, wondering if anything was broken-</p><p>Across the way, there was a pile of rags where Matthias had once been.</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus Christ...&#x201d; Jim repositioned his night goggles and retrieved his weapons then crawled through the sand to his boss. </p><p>&#x201c;Matthias... oh, fucking A...&#x201d;</p><p>The man&#x2019;s lower leg looked like a root that had been torn up out of the ground, the limb nothing but a ragged stump that was shredded at the end. And there were patches of darkness on his fatigues that had to be blood.</p><p>Jim checked the pulse at the neck. There was one, but it was faint and uneven.</p><p>Unbuckling his belt, he cranked the leather around Matthias upper calf and pulled hard, torniqueing the leg. Then he quickly searched for other inj-</p><p>Shit. When Matthias had been tossed back, he&#x2019;d fallen onto a wooden spike. The damn thing went right through him, the toothpick to his pig-in-a-blanket.</p><p>Jim pretzeled up and tried to see whether it could stay in place- </p><p>It appeared to be free standing. Good. </p><p>&#x201c;...dan... ny... boy...&#x201d;</p><p>Jim frowned and looked at his boss. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>Matthias&#x2019;s eyes opened like his lids were steel shutters he could barely raise. &#x201c;Leave me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re blown to shit-&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Leave me here-&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck that.&#x201d; Jim reached for his transistor and prayed that Isaac, not that freak Ezekiel, answered. &#x201c;Come on... come on...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What ya&#x2019;ll needin&#x2019;?&#x201d; The soft Southern drawl that came over his earpiece was the only good news he was going run across until he got them both back to camp.</p><p>Thank God for Isaac. &#x201c;Matthias is down. Bomb. Coming in. Look out for us.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;How bad?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where ya&#x2019;ll at? I&#x2019;ll come and get you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re forty-six degrees n-&#x201d;</p><p>The gun went off right next to Jim&#x2019;s ear and at first he assumed he&#x2019;d been hit in the head and the pain had yet to register. As he braced himself on one palm, Matthias let his gun fall to the side... and what do you know, Jim did not follow suit thanks to some kind of head wound. Warning shot, evidently.</p><p>His boss&#x2019;s eyes shone with unholy light. &#x201c;Get yourself... out... alive.&#x201d;</p><p>Before Jim could tell Matthias to shut the fuck up, he became aware that something was biting into his palm. Lifting his hand up, he found... part of the bomb&#x2019;s detonator.</p><p>Turning it over and over, at first he didn&#x2019;t understand what he was looking at.</p><p>And then he knew all too well what it was.</p><p>Narrowing his eyes, he focused on Matthias. Then he put the fragment in his front pocket, and leaned down to his boss.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not playing me like this,&#x201d; Jim said grimly. &#x201c;No fucking way.&#x201d;</p><p>Matthias started to babble, but Jim didn&#x2019;t give a shit what the guy went on about. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay,&#x201d; he said to Isaac&#x2019;s squawking curses. &#x201c;Misfire. I&#x2019;m starting for camp. Make sure we&#x2019;re not shot as we approach.&#x201d;</p><p>The southerner&#x2019;s voice became instantly strong and steady, just like the guy&#x2019;s killing hand. &#x201c;Where you at. I&#x2019;ll get a truck-&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Stay put. Find a medic on the QT and make sure the doc can keep his mouth shut. And we&#x2019;re going to need a chopper. We need to airlift him out- discretely. No one can know about this.&#x201d;</p><p>The last thing he needed was Isaac out in the middle of the night looking for them. The guy was the only thing standing between Jim and an accusation that he&#x2019;d murdered the head of XOps, the deadliest shadow org in the U.S. government. </p><p>He&#x2019;d never live that one down. Literally.</p><p>And the hush-hush was not going to be a newsflash to the solider. Keeping quiet about shit was the M.O. in XOps- no one knew exactly how many operatives there were or where they went or what they did or whether they went by their own name or an alias.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you hear me, Isaac,&#x201d; he demanded. &#x201c;Get me what I need. Or he&#x2019;s a dead man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Roger, that,&#x201d; came the reply over the ear piece. &#x201c;Over and out.&#x201d; </p><p>After confiscating the gun that had been put to use, Jim picked up his boss, settled the dead, dripping weight on his shoulders and started hoofing it. </p><p>Out of the stone shack. Out into the blustering, frigid night. Across the sand dunes.</p><p>His compass kept him right, the true north orientating him and leading him on through the darkness. Without it, he would be utterly lost because the desert looked the same.</p><p>Fucking Matthias. </p><p>God damn him.</p><p>Then again, assuming the guy lived, he&#x2019;d just given Jim his ticket out of XOps... so in a way, he owed the guy his life. </p><p>Guess Jim wasn&#x2019;t the only one who wanted to be free. </p><p>Surprise, surprise.</p></p><h2>Faith-Rooted Organizing: Mobilizing the Church in Service to the World</h2><p>With so many injustices, small and great, across the world and right at our doorstep, what are people of faith to do? Since the 1930s, organizing movements for social justice in the U.S. have largely been built on assumptions that are secular origin&#x2015;such as reliance on self-interest and having a common enemy as a motivator for change. But what if Christians were to shape their organizing around the implications of the truth that God is real and Jesus is risen? Alexia Salvatierra has developed a model of social action that is rooted in the values and convictions born of faith. Together with theologian Peter Heltzel, this model of "faith-rooted organizing" offers a path to meaningful social change that takes seriously the command to love God and to love our neighbor as ourself.</p><p>Alexia Salvatierra is an ordained pastor in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. For over eleven years she was the executive director of Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice (CLUE). She teaches and trains people throughout the United States in the principles and methods of faith-rooted organizing.<br><br>Peter Goodwin Heltzel is associate professor of systematic theology and director of the Micah Institute at New York Theological Seminary. He serves as assistant pastor of evangelism at Park Avenue Christian Church in New York City, and is the author of <em>Jesus and Justice: Evangelicals, Race and American Politics</em> and <em>Resurrection City: A Theology of Improvisation.</em>"<em>Faith-Rooted Organizing</em> blends the voice of an evangelical-activist theologian in Heltzel with the homespun profundity of a seasoned pastor and campaign organizer in Salvatierra. The authors delight readers with complementary writing styles: Heltzel speaks through theological propositions, interpolated intermittently with jazz references and theological punch lines; Salvatierra communicates through proverbs, organizing anecdotes, poignant biblical passages, and narrative side notes. "The result is a well-argued and accessible text that should resonate from the seminary to the sanctuary." (Andrew Wilkes, Sojourners, August 2014)<br><br>"This isn't a book about food pantries, soup kitchens and clothing drives. Rather, the authors show how the call of the prophets is still among us and how the teachings of Jesus can impact the whole of society. . . . [H]elps us see the power of hospitality and the need for congregations to work in their communities toward hope, wholeness and justice." (Todd Outcalt, YouthWorker Journal, March/April 2014)<br><br>"Organizing is an old tradition, but for years there was a mindset that it is all about self-interest and manipulating power, whatever the collateral damage. Peter and Alexia bring us to a new/ancient place, social justice with sleeves rolled up, grounded in organizing for good as the deepest expression of faith. <em>Faith-Rooted Organizing</em> weaves Scripture with practice and the prophetic voice with practical steps, presenting organizing as a spiritual act of partnering with God in repairing the world." (David M. Elcott, Taub Professor of Practice in Public Service and Leadership, Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service, New York University)<br><br>"Too much theology today is written in words rather than deeds. But God sent his Word as a doing verb, and Alexia Salvatierra and Peter Heltzel teach and show what it means to share in the doing." (Peter Ochs, Edgar Bronfman Professor of Modern Judaic Studies, University of Virginia)<br><br>"Inspired by Gandhi, King, Chavez and the work of past and present-day faith-rooted organizers, Alexia Salvatierra and Peter Heltzel have taken their visions and written them down. Salvatierra illuminates the spiritual principles that guided the civil rights and farmworkers movements. Heltzel helps us understand how this work is not only about justice in this world, it is the work of the gospel itself. This book is a gift to the church and the world. Definitely required reading for any congregation that wants to put their faith into action in today's world." (Lisa Sharon Harper, director of mobilizing, Sojourners, and author of Evangelical Does Not Equal Republican . . . or Democrat and Left, Right and Christ: Evangelical Faith in Politics)<br><br>"Faith-rooted organizing is big on faithfulness, hanging in there, building relationships, training leaders, changing social structures and asking what it means to follow Jesus in today's world. It thus combines the best aspects of resource mobilization theory with what is now ubiquitously called 'framing,' and in this superb book by Alexia Salvatierra and Peter Heltzel, two leading Christian organizers give us a compelling account of what works and what doesn't." (Gary Dorrien, author of Economy, Difference, Empire: Social Ethics for Social Justice)<br><br>"On a cold February night some years ago I experienced a rite of passage in my understanding of mission. Two thousand followers of Jesus created a table in the midst of creation. They met with the mayor of New York City to negotiate issues like crime, drugs, jobs and affordable housing as they struggled to reroot the life and mission of their congregations in their communities. I saw the power and effectiveness of community organizing come alive. I saw the Nehemiah Project literally rebuild burned-out neighborhoods around our congregations with thousands of units of affordable housing. "The arts of community organizing have come a long way since the scuffling days of Saul Alinsky and the Back of the Yards organization in Chicago. For me, over the years, connecting with organizing networks has been life giving and game changing. The arts of listening, power analysis and leadership development have undergirded my ministry as parish pastor, bishop and now denominational executive. "In writing <em>Faith-Rooted Organizing</em> Alexia Salvatierra and Peter Heltzel have made an immense contribution to the maturing of the community-organizing tradition in relationship to the mission of the Christian gospel. They begin where people of faith live: in the biblical drama, their local faith communities, their daily walk with Jesus. This book makes organizing accessible to evangelical Christians, and provides renewal and deep grounding for all spiritual journeys. "For example, sometimes Christians encounter community organizing through the lens of power, and they struggle to see its resonance with Christian ethics. The chapter on 'serpent power' and 'dove power,' speaking of power from within the depths of the Christian narrative, is both realistic and hopeful. All through the book I got the sense of an attempt not to make organizing palatable to evangelical Christians but instead to help bring out the great gifts that Christians contribute to any effort to rebuild a just world. The perspective of 'the least of these' always keeps faith-rooted organizing rooted in the perspective of Jesus. "<em>Faith-Rooted Organizing</em> is steeped in real-life experience. Many stories make the concepts come alive. And the book is a love letter from Alexia and Peter to an emerging generation seeking to follow Jesus in lives that matter." (Stephen Paul Bouman, executive director, Congregational and Synodical Mission, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America)<br><br>"A superb integration of biblical faith and community organizing. This book is both an excellent manual and a vast feast of delightful, empowering stories. A must-read for anyone interested in empowering people to work for justice." (Ronald J. Sider, founder of Evangelicals for Social Action)<br><br>"Martin Buber said that the opposite of slavery is not freedom, but community. Such a beloved community is grounded in justice and radical hospitality. Now how do we engage the powers in the struggle for community? Many thanks to Alexia, Peter and InterVarsity Press for gifting the organizing community with this book." (Phillip Lawson, pastor emeritus, Easter Hill United Methodist Church)<br><br>"It's tempting to look at all the problems in the world, throw our hands up at God and say, 'Why don't you do something?' When we ask that, we often hear God say back, 'I did something. I made you.' Throughout history, the movements that have changed the world for good have been divine conspiracies, holy collaborations between God and people. For some reason, God doesn't want to change the world without us. Sometimes we are waiting on God, and God is waiting on us. When we ask God to move a mountain, God might give us a shovel. In this book, Peter and Alexia remind us that faith has to have feet--the good news needs to become flesh. The gospel is not just about ideas, it's about action--Jesus does not just offer us a presentation of ideas but an invitation to join a movement. As you read it, keep your eyes open for ways you might be called to become a part of the change we all want to see in the world."

I remember making my first one and marveling at how much easier it was than it looked. That quilt hangs in my cousin's home today. Ruth Ann Berry looked at ways that she could separate the moving parts in the design from the static background. She came up with four different solutions to do this: what she calls a scribble on a solid background; a scribble on a background of busy prints; the scribble and background made from different, contrasting color runs; and a solid-color splash across a series of plaids or a background of stripes. I never would have thought of plaids years past. I loved the energy that the quilts reflect. In addition to the eight patterns she includes, Ruth Ann also teaches you how to draft your own original design on graph paper.

The torrent all but swept away the conservative order that had kept peace on the continent since Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo in 1815 -- but which in many countries had also suppressed dreams of national freedom. Political events so dramatic had not been seen in Europe since the French Revolution, and they would not be witnessed again until 1989, with the revolutions in Eastern and Central Europe.<br><br> In <i>1848</i>, historian Mike Rapport examines the roots of the ferment and then, with breathtaking pace, chronicles the explosive spread of violence across Europe. A vivid narrative of a complex chain of interconnected revolutions, <i>1848</i> tells the exhilarating story of Europe's violent "Spring of Nations" and traces its reverberations to the present day.<br><br></p><p><b>Mike Rapport</b> is a Reader in History at the University of Glasgow and a fellow of the Royal Historical Society.

Brumet weaves together strands of psychology, Eastern and Western mysticism, Bible interpretation, and personal stories as he gently guides you into new beginnings.</p><p>Robert Brumet is a Unity minister and chairman of pastoral studies at Unity Institute and Seminary at Unity Village, Missouri. He teaches counseling, meditation and world religions, and presents meditation retreats throughout the United States. He has served as senior minister in churches in Kansas and Indiana.Several years ago I dreamed that I was living in this particular house. It was the house of my childhood, the house in which I lived for sixteen years. In this dream, my wife and I and our four children were inside the house enjoying one another's company. Suddenly, the house began to shake. The walls began to cave in; the ceiling started to fall. In panic, I shouted, "Everyone, get out quickly!" I ran out the front door as fast as I could. The ground beneath my feet was shaking violently. I turned to look behind me, and as I did, I saw the house collapse into a pile of rubble. Everyone inside was killed; eveything in it was destroyed. I was shaken to the very depths of my being. <p>And then, I looked up at the night sky and saw millions of crystal stars looking down upon me. Suddenly, I felt at one with all that my eyes could see. In that instant, I experienced, simultaneously, bottomless grief and infinite joy. I then knew that thse were but opposite sides of the same coin. I sensed the death of my old life and the birth of a new one. This was the beginning of my transition. </p><p>Three years later my twenty-five-year marriage had come to an end. My work as a minister of a Unity church was over. My life was in chaos. I was nearly bankrupt. My sense of identity was demolished. The pain and confusion felt overwhelming. I stood, in shock, looking at the rubble that was once my life. At age forty-five, I felt as if my life was over. </p><p>It was. The new life that has emerged is no the same as the old one. Out of the ashes of the former life, a new birth has taken place. Indeed, God was in charge--yet in the midst of my darkness, I could not see that. I had no maps, no guidelines, no history upon which I could draw in order to understand my experience. </p><p>I have since encountered many other persons struggling with the pain and uncertainty of transition. I saw that they, like myself, were totally unprepared for the impact that change would have on their lives. I realized that our culture--in spite of the enormous changes that have occurred since the mid-sixties--offers us little in the way of halp in coping with change. The world of my youth was a world where change was simply not acknowledged. And if the change was so great that it must be acknowledged, then it was treated as a tragedy from which we must recover as quickly as possible so that we could return our lives to "normal." Such was the only model for change that I knew. </p><p>Even though the world of today bears little resemblance to the world of my youth, I see and hear individuals responding to change much in the same manner that I was taught: Ignore the past and "get on" with life! The problem with this approach is that it doesn't work! Yet we seem to keep trying--perhaps because we don't know any other way. Perhaps it's time to find another way! </p><p>This book has two objectives. One is to offer an alternative model for navigating one's way through life's transitions--to provide somewhat of a "map" for the journey. A second, and perhaps the more important objective, is to help the reader discover that a major life transition is an opportunity for transformation--a transformation into an entirely new life. A transition is an opportunity for spiritual rebirth if we see clearly and respond wisely. I hope that this book will serve as a guide to that end. </p><p>This book is divided into three major sections. The first discusses the general nature of change and the dynamics of the transition process. The second section looks at the individual components of the transition process and parallels each with the biblical story of the Exodus, the journey of the Israelites from their bondage in Egypt into the Promised Land of Canaan. The third section looks at transition from a broader philosophical perspective and addresses questions such as: What's it all about? Where is this taking us? Does it ever end?</p></p><h2>The Year of Our Lord 1943: Christian Humanism in an Age of Crisis</h2><p>By early 1943, it had become increasingly clear that the Allies would win the Second World War. Around the same time, it also became increasingly clear to many Christian intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic that the soon-to-be-victorious nations were not culturally or morally prepared for their success. A war won by technological superiority merely laid the groundwork for a post-war society governed by technocrats. These Christian intellectuals-Jacques Maritain, T. S. Eliot, C. S. Lewis, W. H. Auden, and Simone Weil, among others-sought both to articulate a sober and reflective critique of their own culture and to outline a plan for the moral and spiritual regeneration of their countries in the post-war world. <br><br>In this book, Alan Jacobs explores the poems, novels, essays, reviews, and lectures of these five central figures, in which they presented, with great imaginative energy and force, pictures of the very different paths now set before the Western democracies. Working mostly separately and in ignorance of one another's ideas, the five developed a strikingly consistent argument that the only means by which democratic societies could be prepared for their world-wide economic and political dominance was through a renewal of education that was grounded in a Christian understanding of the power and limitations of human beings. <em>The Year of Our Lord 1943</em> is the first book to weave together the ideas of these five intellectuals and shows why, in a time of unprecedented total war, they all thought it vital to restore Christianity to a leading role in the renewal of the Western democracies.<br></p><p><br><strong>Alan Jacobs</strong> is Distinguished Professor of the Humanities in the Honors Program at Baylor University. His most recent books <em>are The Book of Common Prayer: A Biography</em> and a critical edition of W. H. Auden's long poem <em>For the Time Being: A Christmas Oratorio</em>.<br><br>"This is an interesting book about Christian humanism in an age of crisis, specifically during the Second World War." -- David Lorimer, <em>Paradigm Explorer</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Year of Our Lord 1943</em> is a fascinating and insightful reflection on intellectuals' reaction to perceived crisis. In their literary, philosophical, journalistic and private writings, Eliot, Weil, Maritain, Auden, and Lewis expressed their fear that humanity was approaching a destructive crisis of its own making. The book's elegant style and gripping prose linger with the reader, along with a persistent reflection on the desirable and possible intellectual reactions to contemporary man-made crises, and on the human moral values worth preserving as a guidance for the future." -- Or Rosenboim, <em>H-Diplo</em><p></p><br>"Jacobs's biographical method is, in many ways, the star of the show. Letting his characters' voices weave themselves together, Jacobs aptly pulls them into common points of reflection." -- Peter Boumgarden , <em>The Christian Century</em><p></p><br>"We end our reading of the book vastly better informed about the culture and thought of the 1940s, and amply equipped to see how those ideas would resonate over the next three or four decades. Alan Jacobs has written book." --Phillip Jenkins, <em>The Englewood Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"Alan Jacobs weaves a remarkable tale of five major Christian thinkers striving to make sense of a world in chaos and to speak wisdom to that world. This is a major achievement, wonderfully readable, the crowning work of our own era's most resourceful Christian intellectual."--Charles Marsh, Commonwealth Professor of Religious Studies and Director of the Project on Lived Theology, University of Virginia<p></p><br>"Alan Jacob's prose wears immense learning lightly, with great grace and to great effect. To think alongside these writers, under Jacobs's stage direction, to hear them across a gap of three-quarters of a century think with gravity and sincerity, pondering the nature of the human soul, palpably straining toward the ideal of the common good, feeling the pull of their religion's perennial pitfalls, in a situation and language different from and yet not wholly unlike our own, is riveting, challenging, and life-giving."--Lori Branch, author of <em>Rituals of Spontaneity</em><p></p><br>"Alan Jacobs has written an elegant and deeply learned book on Christian humanism in the critical years of the Second World War. He opens a window into some of the most luminous and profound thinking about the nature and possibilities of civilization during those troubled years. By doing so, has opened a window for thinking about our own troubled times."-James D. Hunter, author of <em>To Change the World: The Irony, Tragedy, and Possibility of Christianity in the Late Modern World</em><p></p><br>"Jacobs seems to have written this with an eye to the time between the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s and the events of 9/11, when it seemed that democracy had finally achieved peace, only to find it widely rejected. His look at how these five figures struggled with similar turns of events is worth pondering." --<em>Library Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"While Jacobs can only begin to scratch the surface of such complex debates, his book is an erudite collective portrait of postwar Christian intellectuals." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Pose, Wobble, Flow: A Culturally Proactive Approach to Literacy Instruction (Language and Literacy Series)</h2><p><p>This book proposes a pedagogical model called &#x201c;Pose, Wobble, Flow&#x201d; to encapsulate the challenge of teaching and the process of growing as an educator who questions existing inequities in schooling and society and frames teaching around a commitment to changing them. The authors provide six different culturally proactive teaching stances or &#x201c;poses&#x201d; that secondary ELA teachers can use to meet the needs of <em>all</em> students, whether they are historically marginalized or privileged. They describe how teachers can expect to &#x201c;wobble&#x201d; as they adapt instruction to the needs of their students, while also incorporating new insights about their own cultural positionality and preconceptions about teaching. Teachers are encouraged to recognize this flexibility as a positive process or &#x201c;flow&#x201d; that can be used to address challenges and adopt ambitious teaching strategies like those depicted in this book. Each chapter highlights a particular pose, describes how to work through common wobbles, incorporates teacher voices, and provides questions for further discussion. <em>Pose, Wobble, Flow</em> presents a framework for disrupting the pervasive myth that there is one set of surefire, culturally neutral &#x201c;best&#x201d; practices.</p> <p><strong>Book Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li> A structure for career-long growth for ELA teachers, including ways to adapt pedagogy from one year to the next.</li> <li> A focus on culturally proactive positions within ELA classrooms to ensure criticality in how we teach and how we advocate for the teaching profession.</li> <li> Six different poses that are standards-aligned, critical, and expand the possibilities of what takes place in school.</li> <li> Guidelines for creating original poses beyond the scope of the book, discussion questions for courses, and resources for classroom teachers.</li></ul></p><p><p><br> "<br> <em>In Pose, Wobble, Flow,</em><br> Garcia and O'Donnell-Allen remind all of us that teaching is not about following directions: it&#x2019;s about listening to our students and paying attention to the social forces that shape their lives; about learning how to navigate department, school, district, and federal rules to benefit our students so we can keep a job while we continue to honor our core beliefs about education."<br> &#x2014;<br> <strong>Linda Christensen</strong><br> , director, Oregon Writing Project, Lewis &amp; Clark College<br> </p><br><br><p><br> "Antero Garcia and Cindy O&#x2019;Donnell-Allen have written a book about teaching that I&#x2019;ve been hoping someone would write.

The spiritual ideals of any tradition, whether Christian commandments or Buddhist precepts, can provide easy justification for practitioners to duck uncomfortable feelings in favor of more seemingly enlightened activity. When split off from fundamental psychological needs, such actions often do much more harm than good.<br><br>While other authors have touched on the subject, this is the first book fully devoted to spiritual bypassing. In the lineage of Ch�gyam Trungpa&#x2019;s landmark <i>Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism</i>, <i>Spiritual Bypassing </i>provides an in-depth look at the unresolved or ignored psychological issues often masked as spirituality, including self-judgment, excessive niceness, and emotional dissociation. A&nbsp; longtime psychotherapist with an engaging writing style, Masters furthers the body of psychological insight into how we use (and abuse) religion in often unconscious ways. This book will hold particular appeal for those who grew up with an unstructured new-age spirituality now looking for a more mature spiritual practice, and for anyone seeking increased self-awareness and a more robust relationship with themselves and others.</p><p>Robert Augustus Masters, PhD, is a relationship expert, an integral psychotherapist, and a psychospiritual guide and trainer, with a doctorate in psychology.

Its contents are truly mandatory for this day and age."<br>&#x2014;Ken Wilber, author of <i>The Integral Vision </i><br><br>"This timely and penetrating analysis of spirituality&#x2019;s shadow provides a much-needed counterpoint for those who tend to get blinded by its light."<br>&#x2014;Stephen Batchelor, author of <i>Buddhism without Beliefs</i><br><br>"There is much wisdom and good information in this book. Robert joins a growing number of wise teachers who understand that the personal and the universal must be combined to bring true and genuine spiritual awakening."<br>&#x2014;Jack Kornfield, author of <i>A Path With Heart</i> and <i>After the Ecstasy, the Laundry</i><br><br>"Traversing the muddy waters of contemporary spirituality requires a willingness to meet its seen and unseen challenges with ruthless self-honesty and keen discernment. Robert addresses 'the many faces of spiritual bypassing' with intellectual rigor, hard-earned insight, and emotional intelligence. It is a lucid, well-written, and practical guide for both new and seasoned practitioners on the spiritual path."<br>&#x2014;Mariana Caplan, PhD, author of <i>Eyes Wide Open: Cultivating Discernment on the Spiritual Path </i>and<i> Halfway Up the Mountain: the Error of Premature Claims to Enlightenment</i><br><br>"Robert Masters has given us a great gift&#x2014;a tremendously useful guide to examining our tendencies to spiritual bypassing, clearly the most comprehensive and accessible treatment available on this crucial topic. His work is a great contribution to the ongoing integration of psychotherapy and spiritual practice, and to our understanding of the meaning of spiritual maturity."<br>&#x2014;Donald Rothberg, PhD, author of <i>The Engaged Spiritual Life</i><br><br>"In <i>Spiritual Bypassing</i>, Robert Masters eloquently reminds us of something we have unknowingly misplaced on our spiritual journeys: Mother Earth. In our efforts to bypass our earthly challenges, we have disconnected from the Ground of our very being, seeking our wholeness on a pogo stick to the stars. In poignant and clarifying language, Robert calls us back home, confronting us with our avoidance, inviting us to find our spirituality in the heart/depths of our humanness. In an era where detachment models for spirituality are becoming dangerously prevalent, his inclusive message is of profound importance. It may not appeal to the part of us that wants the path to be easy, but it will speak loudly to the part of us that longs for the truth. I recommend it wholeheartedly."<br>&#x2014;Jeff Brown, author of <i>Soulshaping</i><br><br>"In <i>Spiritual Bypassing</i>, Robert Augustus Masters offers a wake-up call&#x2014;more of a shout&#x2014;to those of us who have unwittingly fallen prey to all manner of promising and seductive antidotes to our pain and suffering in the form of detached spiritual teachings and New Age magical thinking. The book is a sobering and powerful reminder that our present embodiment, in all its flawed, messy humanness, cannot be conveniently sidestepped, and so invites us inward to a face-to-face encounter and embrace with the raw truth of who we really are. Masters&#x2019; unique and at times disarming prose style blends a poetic sensibility with a surprising stark clarity that points us to 'What Really Matters.'"<br>&#x2014;Eliezer Sobel, author of <i>The 99th Monkey: A Spiritual Journalist&#x2019;s Misadventures with Gurus, Messiahs, Sex, Psychedelics, and Other Consciousness-Raising Experiments</i><br><br>"There is much hard-won wisdom in this work. <i>Spiritual Bypassing</i> is a detailed, point-by-point description of how so-called spirituality can be used by some to actually avoid individuation, adulthood, and the <i>daimonic</i>. When Carl Jung noted that &#x201c;neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering,&#x201d; he hinted that, especially for the Western psyche, spiritual practice itself can be just such a sneaky neurosis. This insightful, firm, confrontive yet compassionate book promotes and encourages the complementary marriage of spiritual practice and psychotherapy, recognizing that they are&#x2014;and, at best, have always been&#x2014;basically two integrally related sides of the same existential coin: The most profound psychotherapy is essentially spiritual; and the deepest spiritual quest includes some depth psychology. Neither approach can be excluded on the unpredictable path toward selfhood. But even the powerful fusion of spirituality and psychotherapy cannot offer transcendent perfection. Selfhood or spiritual enlightenment is never about escaping or distorting inner or outer reality to serve our egos, but requires lovingly accepting and embracing reality as it is and on its own terms."<br>&#x2014;Stephen Diamond, PhD, author of <i>Anger, Madness, and the Daimonic: The Psychological Genesis of Violence, Evil, and Creativity</i><br><br>"Uncompromising and truth-telling, this book is an antidote to spiritual obesity. What emerges is the call to psychological clarity as essential to the mature spiritual life. Here is soul-fuel for those who would enter the road less traveled&#x2014;the deeply examined life as part of spiritual practice."<br>&#x2014;Jean Houston, PhD, author of <i>A Mythic Life<br><br></i>"The escape act and forms of denial and self-delusion that Robert Masters diagnoses as 'spiritual bypassing' have been with us for millennia &#x2014; perhaps since our early ancestors first discovered psycho-spiritual experiences that seemed to relieve the pressures of living and dying. But the syndrome has become endemic in our frothy age of virtual everything &#x2014; so we are all blessed by the appearance of this diamond of a book. Here a priest of our true wellness has distilled the blood, sweat, and tears of his decades of fervent triage work in trenches of bypassing into essences of truly healing wisdom. Every spiritual practitioner would do well to study <i>Spiritual Bypassing</i> again and again. So would every one of us who presume to teach any spirituality at all. Thankfully, it's as much compassionate antidote as prophetic critique. May it be put to grateful use as long as the illness it treats continues &nbsp;to ravage human bodies, souls, and lives." <br> &#x2014;Saniel Bonder, founder, Waking Down in Mutuality, and author of <i>Healing the Spirit/Matter Split </i>and<i> Waking Down</i><br><i><br>&#x201c;<i>Spiritual Bypassing</i></i> casts a critical eye on our deeply entrenched misuse of spirituality... Masters provides a framework for how to deal with and integrate &#x2018;negative&#x2019; emotions such as anger, fear, hate and judgment into a more authentic way of living. While most self-help books these days seem to simply tell you to &#x2018;just be more positive,&#x2019; &#x2018;avoid negativity&#x2019; or &#x2018;have more compassion,&#x2019; Masters suggests a method where we can simultaneously choose to be compassionate while also still choosing to acknowledge our heartfelt anger&#x2014;without expressing it with excessive aggression or repressing it through denial or other practices that might numb our real feelings... <i>Spiritual Bypassing</i> is a must read for anyone who is looking for a more integrated spirituality, authentic relationship with themselves and others, and practical methods for dealing with unresolved wounds.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>Spiritual Media Blog</i><br><br>&#x201c;In my opinion, [<i>Spiritual Bypassing</i>] will become as important as Chogyam Trungpa's <i>Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism</i>...

These longings form the basis of the Old Testament exile theology and cause us reassess the relationship between Christianity and the Hebrew tradition. This is no fundamentalist work harking back to the idea that "the oldest is the purest." Rather it is recognition that the Old Testament has a complex heritage and that those who shared this heritage did not share the same beliefs or scriptures&#x2015;amongst these people were the first Christians. In her exploration of temple theology, Margaret Barker finds clear references and beliefs in fundamental Christian concepts such as atonement, creation, and covenant. This is a thorough and fascinating exploration of the theology of the original Jewish Temple.</p><p>Margaret Barker is a well-known and high-selling author and former president of the Society for Old Testament study. She is a member of the ecumenical Patriarch&#39;s Symposium on Religion, Science and the Environment and a Methodist Local Preacher.</p><h2>Absurdistan: A Novel</h2><p>&#x201c;<i>Absurdistan</i> is not just a hilarious novel, but a record of a particular peak in the history of human folly. No one is more capable of dealing with the transition from the hell of socialism to the hell of capitalism in Eastern Europe than Shteyngart, the great-great grandson of one Nikolai Gogol and the funniest foreigner alive.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Aleksandar Hemon<br><br>From the critically acclaimed, bestselling author of<i> The Russian Debutante&#x2019;s Handbook</i> comes the uproarious and poignant story of one very fat man and one very small country<br>Meet Misha Vainberg, aka Snack Daddy, a 325-pound disaster of a human being, son of the 1,238th-richest man in Russia, proud holder of a degree in multicultural studies from Accidental College, USA (don&#x2019;t even ask), and patriot of no country save the great City of New York. Poor Misha just wants to live in the South Bronx with his hot Latina girlfriend, but after his gangster father murders an Oklahoma businessman in Russia, all hopes of a U.S. visa are lost.<br>Salvation lies in the tiny, oil-rich nation of Absurdistan, where a crooked consular officer will sell Misha a Belgian passport. But after a civil war breaks out between two competing ethnic groups and a local warlord installs hapless Misha as minister of multicultural affairs, our hero soon finds himself covered in oil, fighting for his life, falling in love, and trying to figure out if a normal life is still possible in the twenty-first century. <br>With the enormous success of<i> The Russian Debutante&#x2019;s Handbook,</i> Gary Shteyngart established himself as a central figure in today&#x2019;s literary world&#x2014;&#x201c;one of the most talented and entertaining writers of his generation,&#x201d; according to<i> The New York Observer</i>. In<i> Absurdistan,</i> he delivers an even funnier and wiser literary performance. Misha Vainberg is a hero for the new century, a glimmer of humanity in a world of dashed hopes.</p><p><b>Gary Shteyngart</b>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author of the memoir&nbsp;<i>Little Failure&nbsp;</i>(a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist) and the novels&nbsp;<i>Super Sad True Love Story</i>&nbsp;(winner of the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize),<i>&nbsp;Absurdistan,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Russian Debutante&#x2019;s Handbook</i>&nbsp;(winner of the Stephen Crane Award for First Fiction and the National Jewish Book Award for Fiction)<i>.&nbsp;</i>His books regularly appear on best-of lists around the world and have been published in thirty countries.1<br><br> The Night in Question<br><br> June 15, 2001<br><br> I am Misha Borisovich Vainberg, age thirty, a grossly overweight man with small, deeply set blue eyes, a pretty Jewish beak that brings to mind the most distinguished breed of parrot, and lips so delicate you would want to wipe them with the naked back of your hand.<br><br> For many of my last years, I have lived in St. Petersburg, Russia, neither by choice nor by desire. The City of the Czars, the Venice of the North, Russia&#x2019;s cultural capital . . . forget all that. By the year 2001, our St. Leninsburg has taken on the appearance of a phantasmagoric third-world city, our neoclassical buildings sinking into the crap-choked canals, bizarre peasant huts fashioned out of corrugated metal and plywood colonizing the broad avenues with their capitalist iconography (cigarette ads featuring an American football player catching a hamburger with a baseball mitt), and what is worst of all, our intelligent, depressive citizenry has been replaced by a new race of mutants dressed in studied imitation of the West, young women in tight Lycra, their scooped-up little breasts pointing at once to New York and Shanghai, with men in fake black Calvin Klein jeans hanging limply around their caved-in asses.<br><br> The good news is that when you&#x2019;re an incorrigible fatso like me&#x2014;325 pounds at last count&#x2014;and the son of the 1,238th richest man in Russia, all of St. Leninsburg rushes out to service you: the drawbridges lower themselves as you advance, and the pretty palaces line up alongside the canal banks, thrusting their busty friezes in your face. You are blessed with the rarest treasure to be found in this mineral-rich land. You are blessed with respect.<br><br> On the night of June 15 in the catastrophic year 2001, I was getting plenty of respect from my friends at a restaurant called the Home of the Russian Fisherman on Krestovskiy Island, one of the verdant islands caught in the delta of the Neva River. Krestovskiy is where we rich people pretend to be living in a kind of post-Soviet Switzerland, trudging along the manicured bike paths built &#x2019;round our kottedzhes and town khauses, and filling our lungs with parcels of atmosphere seemingly imported from the Alps.<br><br> The Fisherman&#x2019;s gimmick is that you catch your own fish out of a man-made lake, and then for about US$50 per kilo, the kitchen staff will smoke it for you or bake it on coals. On what the police would later call &#x201c;the night in question,&#x201d; we were standing around the Spawning Salmon pontoon, yelling at our servants, drinking down carafes of green California Riesling, our Nokia mobilniki ringing with the social urgency that comes only when the White Nights strangle the nighttime, when the inhabitants of our ruined city are kept permanently awake by the pink afterglow of the northern sun, when the best you can do is drink your friends into the morning.<br><br> Let me tell you something: without good friends, you might as well drown yourself in Russia. After decades of listening to the familial agitprop of our parents (&#x201c;We will die for you!&#x201d; they sing), after surviving the criminal closeness of the Russian family (&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t leave us!&#x201d; they plead), after the crass socialization foisted upon us by our teachers and factory directors (&#x201c;We will staple your circumcised khui to the wall!&#x201d; they threaten), all that&#x2019;s left is that toast between two failed friends in some stinking outdoor beer kiosk.<br><br> &#x201c;To your health, Misha Borisovich.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;To your success, Dimitry Ivanovich.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;To the army, the air force, and the whole Soviet fleet . . . Drink to the bottom!&#x201d;<br><br> I&#x2019;m a modest person bent on privacy and lonely sadness, so I have very few friends. My best buddy in Russia is a former American I like to call Alyosha-Bob. Born Robert Lipshitz in the northern reaches of New York State, this little bald eagle (not a single hair on his dome by age twenty-five) flew to St. Leninsburg eight years ago and was transformed, by dint of alcoholism and inertia, into a successful Rus- sian biznesman renamed Alyosha, the owner of ExcessHollywood, a riotously profitable DVD import-export business, and the swain of Svetlana, a young Petersburg hottie. In addition to being bald, Alyosha-Bob has a pinched face ending in a reddish goatee, wet blue eyes that fool you with their near-tears, and enormous flounder lips cleansed hourly by vodka. A skinhead on the metro once described him as a gnussniy zhid, or a &#x201c;vile-looking Yid,&#x201d; and I think most of the populace sees him that way. I certainly did when I first met him as a fellow undergraduate at Accidental College in the American Midwest a decade ago.<br><br> Alyosha-Bob and I have an interesting hobby that we indulge whenever possible. We think of ourselves as the Gentlemen Who Like to Rap. Our oeuvre stretches from the old-school jams of Ice Cube, Ice-T, and Public Enemy to the sensuous contemporary rhythms of ghetto tech, a hybrid of Miami bass, Chicago ghetto tracks, and Detroit electronica. The modern reader may be familiar with &#x201c;Ass-N-Titties&#x201d; by DJ Assault, perhaps the seminal work of the genre.<br><br> On the night in question, I got the action started with a Detroit ditty I enjoy on summer days:<br><br> Aw, shit<br><br> Heah I come<br><br> Shut yo mouf<br><br> And bite yo tongue.<br><br> Alyosha-Bob, in his torn Helmut Lang slacks and Accidental College sweatshirt, picked up the tune:<br><br> Aw, girl,<br><br> You think you bad?<br><br> Let me see you<br><br> Bounce dat ass.<br><br> Our melodies rang out over the Russian Fisherman&#x2019;s four pontoons (Spawning Salmon, Imperial Sturgeon, Capricious Trout, and Sweet Little Butterfish), over this whole tiny man-made lake, whatever the hell it&#x2019;s called (Dollar Lake? Euro Pond?), over the complimentary-valet-parking-lot where one of the oafish employees just dented my new Land Rover.<br><br> Heah come dat bitch<br><br> From round de way<br><br> Box my putz<br><br> Like Cassius Clay.<br><br> &#x201c;Sing it, Snack Daddy!&#x201d; Alyosha-Bob cheered me on, using my Accidental College nickname.<br><br> My name is Vainberg<br><br> I like ho&#x2019;s<br><br> Sniff &#x2019;em out<br><br> Wid my Hebrew nose<br><br> Pump that shit<br><br> From &#x2019;round the back<br><br> Big-booty ho<br><br> Ack ack ack<br><br> This being Russia, a nation of busybody peasants thrust into an awkward modernity, some idiot will always endeavor to spoil your good fun. And so the neighboring biznesman, a sunburned midlevel killer standing next to his pasty girlfriend from some cow-filled province, starts in with &#x201c;Now, fellows, why do you have to sing like African exchange students? You both look so cultured&#x201d;&#x2014;in other words, like vile-looking Yids&#x2014;&#x201c;why don&#x2019;t you declaim some Pushkin instead? Didn&#x2019;t he have some nice verses about the White Nights? That would be very seasonal.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, if Pushkin were alive today, he&#x2019;d be a rapper,&#x201d; I said.<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Alyosha-Bob said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;d be M.C. Push.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Fight the power!&#x201d; I said in English.<br><br> Our Pushkin-loving friend stared at us. This is what happens when you don&#x2019;t learn English, by the way. You&#x2019;re always at a loss for words. &#x201c;God help you children,&#x201d; he finally said, taking his lady friend by one diminutive arm and guiding her over to the other side of the pontoon.<br> Children? Was he talking about us? What would an Ice Cube or an Ice-T do in this situation? I reached for my mobilnik, ready to dial my Park Avenue analyst, Dr. Levine, to tell him that once again I had been insulted and injured, that once again I had been undermined by a fellow Russian.<br><br> And then I heard my manservant, Timofey, ringing his special hand bell. The mobilnik fell out of my hand, the Pushkin lover and his girlfriend disappeared from the pontoon, the pontoon itself floated off into another dimension, even Dr. Levine and his soft American ministrations were reduced to a distant hum.<br><br> It was feeding time.<br><br> With a low bow, manservant Timofey presented me with a tray of blackened sturgeon kebabs and a carafe of Black Label. I fell down on a hard plastic chair that twisted and torqued beneath my weight like a piece of modern sculpture. I bent over the sturgeon, sniffing it with closed eyes as if offering a silent prayer. My feet were locked together, my ankles grinding into each other with expectant anxiety. I prepared for my meal in the usual fashion: fork in my left hand; my dominant right clenched into a fist on my lap, ready to punch anyone who dared take away my food.<br><br> I bit into the sturgeon kebab, filling my mouth with both the crisp burnt edges and the smooth mealy interior. My body trembled in- side my leviathan Puma tracksuit, my heroic gut spinning counter- clockwise, my two-scoop breasts slapping against each other. The usual food-inspired images presented themselves. Myself, my Beloved Papa, and my young mother in a hollowed-out boat built to resemble a white swan floating past a grotto, triumphant Stalin-era music echoing around us (&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s my passport! What a passport! It&#x2019;s my great red Soviet passport!&#x201d;), Beloved Papa&#x2019;s wet hands rubbing my tummy and skirting the waistband of my shorts, and Mommy&#x2019;s smooth, dry ones brushing against the nape of my neck, a chorus of their hoarse, tired voices saying, &#x201c;We love you, Misha. We love you, bear cub.&#x201d;<br><br> My body fell into a rocking motion like the religious people rock when they&#x2019;re deep in the thrall of their god. I finished off the first kebab and the one after that, my chin oily with sturgeon juices, my breasts shivering as if they&#x2019;d been smothered with packets of ice. Another chunk of fish fell into my mouth, this one well dusted with parsley and olive oil. I breathed in the smells of the sea, my right fist still clenched, fingers digging into palm, my nose touching the plate, sturgeon extract coating my nostrils, my little circumcised khui burning with the joy of release.<br><br> And then it was over. And then the kebabs were gone. I was left with an empty plate. I was left with nothing before me. Ah, dear me. Where was I now? An abandoned bear cub without his li&#x2019;l fishy. I splashed a glass of water on my face and dabbed myself off with a napkin Timofey had tucked into my tracksuit. I picked up the carafe of Black Label, pressed it to my cold lips, and, with a single tilt of the wrist, emptied it into my gullet.<br><br> The world was golden around me, the evening sun setting light to a row of swaying alders; the alders abuzz with the warble of siskin birds, those striped yellow fellows from our nursery rhymes. I turned pastoral for a moment, my thoughts running to Beloved Papa, who was born in a village and for whom village life should be prescribed, as only there&#x2014;half asleep in a cowshed, naked and ugly, but sober all the same&#x2014;do the soft tremors of what could be happiness cross his swollen Aramaic face. I would have to bring him here one day, to the Home of the Russian Fisherman. I would buy him a few chilled bottles of his favorite Flagman vodka, take him out to the farthest pontoon, put my arm around his dandruff-dusted shoulders, press his tiny lemur head into one of my side hams, and make him understand that despite all the disappointments I have handed him over the past twenty years, the two of us are meant to be together forever.<br> Emerging from the food&#x2019;s thrall, I noticed that the demographics of the Spawning Salmon pontoon were changing. A group of young coworkers in blue blazers had shown up, led by a buffoon in a bow tie who played the role of a &#x201c;fun person,&#x201d; breaking the coworkers up into teams, thrusting fishing rods into their weak hands, and leading them in a chorus of &#x201c;Fi-ish! Fi-ish! Fi-ish!&#x201d; What the hell was going on here? Was this the first sign of an emerging Russian middle class? Did all these idiots work for a German bank? Perhaps they were holders of American MBAs.<br><br> Meanwhile, all eyes fell on a striking older woman in a full-length white gown and black Mikimoto pearls, casting her line into the man-made lake. She was one of those mysteriously elegant women who appeared to have walked in from the year 1913, as if all those red pioneer scarves and peasant blouses from our jackass Soviet days had never alighted on her delicate shoulders.<br><br> I am not enamored of such people, I must say. How is it possi- ble to live outside of history? Who can claim immunity to it by dint of beauty and breeding? My only consolation was that neither this charming creature nor the young Deutsche Bank workers now shouting in unison &#x201c;Sal-mon! Sal-mon!&#x201d; would catch any tasty fish today. Beloved Papa and I have an agreement with the management of the Home of the Russian Fisherman restaurant&#x2014;whenever a Vainberg takes up a rod, the owner&#x2019;s nephew puts on his Aqua-Lung, swims under the pontoons, and hooks the best fish on our lines. So all Czarina with the Black Pearls would get for her troubles would be a tasteless, defective salmon.<br><br> You can&#x2019;t ignore history altogether.<br> On the night in question, Alyosha-Bob and I were joined by three lovely females: Rouenna, the love of my life, visiting for two weeks from the Bronx, New York; Svetlana, Alyosha-Bob&#x2019;s dark-eyed Tatar beauty, a junior public-relations executive for a local chain of perfume shops; and Beloved Papa&#x2019;s twenty-one-year-old provincial wife, Lyuba.<br><br> I must say, I was anxious about bringing these women together (also, I have a generalized fear of women). Svetlana and Rouenna have aggressive personalities; Lyuba and Rouenna were once lower-class and lack refinement; and Svetlana and Lyuba, being Russian, present with symptoms of mild depression rooted in early childhood trauma (cf. Papadapolis, Spiro, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s My Pierogi: Transgenerational Conflict in Post-Soviet Families,&#x201d; Annals of Post-Lacanian Psychiatry, Boulder/Paris, Vol. 23, No. 8, 1997). A part of me expected discord among the women, or what the Americans call &#x201c;fireworks.&#x201d; Another part of me just wanted to see that snobby bitch Svetlana get her ass kicked.<br><br> While Alyosha-Bob and I were rapping, Lyuba&#x2019;s servant girl had been making the girls pretty with lipstick and pomade in one of the Fisherman&#x2019;s changing huts, and when they joined us on the pontoon, they reeked of fake citrus (and a touch of real sweat), their dainty lips aglow in the summer twilight, their teeny voices abuzz with interesting conversation about Stockmann, the celebrated Finnish emporium on St. Leninsburg&#x2019;s main thoroughfare, Nevsky Prospekt. They were discussing a summer special&#x2014;two hand-fluffed Finnish towels for US$20&#x2014;both towels distinguished by their highly un-Russian, shockingly Western color: orange.<br><br> Listening to the tale of the orange towel, I got a little engorged down in the circumcised purple half-khui department. These women of ours were so cute! Well, not my stepmother, Lyuba, obviously, who is eleven years younger than me and happens to spend her nights moaning unconvincingly under the coniferous trunk of Beloved Papa, with his impressive turtlelike khui (blessed memories of it swinging about in the bathtub, my curious toddler hands trying to snatch it).<br><br> And I wasn&#x2019;t hot for Svetlana, either; despite her fashionable Mongol cheekbones, her clingy Italian sweater, and that profoundly calculated aloofness, the supposedly sexy posturing of the educated Russian woman, despite all that, let me tell you, I absolutely refuse to sleep with one of my co-nationals. God only knows where they&#x2019;ve been.<br><br> So that leaves me with my Rouenna Sales (pronounced Sah-lez, in the Spanish manner), my South Bronx girlie-girl, my big-boned precious, my giant multicultural swallow, with her crinkly hair violently pulled back into a red handkerchief, with her glossy pear-shaped brown nose always in need of kisses and lotion.<br><br> &#x201c;I think,&#x201d; said my stepmom, Lyuba, in English for Rouenna&#x2019;s benefit, &#x201c;I thought,&#x201d; she added. She was having trouble with her tenses. &#x201c;I think, I thought . . . I think, I thou...</p><h2>Thank You for Shopping: The Golden Age of Minnesota Department Stores</h2><p>Throughout the twentieth century, department stores ruled the retail landscapes of downtown Minneapolis and St. Paul. More than just shopping centers, stores like Dayton's, Powers, Donaldson's, Young-Quinlan, the Emporium, and the Golden Rule were centers of social life. From the legendary Dayton's Christmas displays to celebrating a special occasion at Schuneman's River Room, the department store was a destination for generations of Minnesotans, within the Twin Cities and beyond.<br><br>In <em>Thank You for Shopping</em>, author Kristal Leebrick presents the history and stories behind Minnesota's great department stores, offering a lively trip back to the glory days. Abundantly illustrated with vintage photos, postcards, advertisements, and artwork, the book explores the experience of shoppers and employees alike.

The two rival navies engage in a deadly game of feint and thrust, waging a series of microwars across the tiny Pacific islands. From Guadalcanal to Okinawa, Japan slowly loses ground.

Today he is Samuel Hunter, a successful Santa Barbara insurance salesman with a Mercedes, a condo, and a hollow, invented life. Then one day, destiny offers him the dangerous gift of love&#x2014;in the exquisite form of Calliope Kincaid&#x2014;and a curse in the unheralded appearance of an ancient god by the name of Coyote. Coyote, the trickster, has arrived to reawaken the mystical storyteller within Sam...and to seriously screw up his existence in the process.</p><p>This is an accelerating comedy with shadows setting off the wry, polished humor.

But the speculative frenzy of the eighties didn't just happen. It was the culmination of a long cycle of slow relaxation of credit practices--the subject of James Grant's brilliant, clear-eyed history of American finance. Two long-running trends converged in the 1980s to create one of our greatest speculative booms: the democratization of credit and the socialization of risk. At the turn of the century, it was almost impossible for the average working person to get a loan. In the 1980s, it was almost impossible to refuse one. As the pace of lending grew, the government undertook to bear more and more of the creditors' risk--a pattern, begun in the Progressive era, which reached full flower in the "conservative" administration of Ronald Reagan. Based on original scholarship as well as firsthand observation, Grant's book puts our recent love affair with debt in an entirely fresh, often chilling, perspective. The result is required--and wickedly entertaining--reading for everyone who wants or needs to understand how the world really works.<br>"A brilliantly eccentric, kaleidoscopic tour of our credit lunacy. . . . A splendid, tooth-gnashing saga that should be savored for its ghoulish humor and passionately debated for its iconoclastic analysis. It is a fitting epitaph to the credit binge of the '80s."--Ron Chernow, The Wall Street Journal.</p></p><p>To Grant, ``money of the mind'' is credit, and here he offers an entertaining as well as instructive chronicle of its near- ruinous emergence in the US. As the author of Bernard M. Baruch (1983) and publisher of a highly regarded newsletter on interest rates, Grant has the scholarly savvy to sift through the complex developments that have shaped American capitalism. He argues, for example, that the speculative excesses of the 1980's represented the culmination of a protracted cycle of increasingly easier credit, not spontaneous phenomena. According to Grant (a sound-money man by conviction), a pair of long-running trends--the democratization of credit and the socialization of risk--converged to create an unprecedented boom during the Reagan years. At the turn of the century, he points out, it was almost impossible for wage earners to borrow; during the past decade, they were invited, even implored, to do so. While US debt spiraled upward in the form of installment loans, junk bonds, mortgages, retail charge accounts, and allied obligations, the federal government accepted greater amounts of the risk (e.g., via deposit insurance) that used to be borne by creditors, an accommodation that Grant dates back to the Progressive Era. With both wit and perception, he lards his narrative with anecdotal accounts of yesteryear's seers and sinners, plus cautionary tales of their latter-day counterparts. In addition to such contemporary celebrities as Michael Milken, David Rockefeller, and Walter Wriston, he profiles less familiar figures from the past--Sewell Avery, George F. Baker, George Champion, James Stillman, et al. A substantive and accessible perspective on how the financial world really works, offering as its moral the unhappy reminder that all pipers eventually must be paid. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The 1980s were the troubling culmination of two trends in American finance--ever easier access to credit and the subsidizing of risk by government. As he explores these trends, Grant, a former Barron's staff writer and editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer , weaves in personal histories of influential financiers, financial markets, and institutions. He places a great deal of emphasis on psychological phenomena--the emotional waves of optimism and pessimism that roll credit markets. Although the stories are well told, there are often too many details and not enough perspective and analysis. Recommended for libraries wishing extensive collections in finance.<br><i>- Richard C.

Mandeville claims to have served in the Great Khan's army, and to have travelled in 'the lands beyond' - countries populated by dog-headed men, cannibals, Amazons and Pygmies. Although Marco Polo's slightly earlier narrative ultimately proved more factually accurate, Mandeville's was widely known, used by Columbus, Leonardo da Vinci and Martin Frobisher, and inspiring writers as diverse as Swift, Defoe and Coleridge. This intriguing blend of fact, exaggeration and absurdity offers both fascinating insight into and subtle criticism of fourteenth-century conceptions of the world.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>By the standards of the 14th century, the writing style of the man who called himself Sir John Mandeville is so informal as to be nearly chummy: &#34;He who wants to pass over the sea to Jerusalem, may go by many ways, both by sea and by land depending on the countries he comes from; many ways come to a single end. But do not think I shall tell of all the towns and cities and castles that men shall go by, for then I must make too long a tale of it.&#34; Historians remain skeptical as to whether the author really did journey to the Holy Land and Egypt, or hire himself out as a soldier to the Great Khan of China. Whatever the case, it is indisputable that he is one of the first modern travel writers, as we have come to know the genre, and that his book was considered authoritative in matters geographical throughout Europe--consulted by Leonardo da Vinci and Christopher Columbus alike.<b>Sir John Mandeville</b> left his native St Albans in 1322 and died in Liege in 1372.</p><h2>Lunatic (The Lost Books #5)</h2><p><p><b>Fight the Horde . . . or die with love.</b></p><p>Separated by time and space, our heroes finally return home.

Oswalt's two-part study of the book of Isaiah for the NICOT series, this commentary on chapters 1�39 combines theological acumen, literary sensitivity, philological expertise, and historical knowledge to present a faithful and accurate reading of one of the Old Testament's most important books.<br><br> In the introduction to this work, Oswalt considers Isaiah's background, unity of composition, date and authorship, canonicity, Hebrew text, theology, and problems of interpretation, and he offers a select bibliography for further research. Oswalt also provides substantial discussions of several issues crucial to the book of Isaiah. He notes, for example, that scholars often divide Isaiah into three divisions, with chapters 1&#x2013;39 addressing Isaiah's contemporaries in the eighth century&nbsp;B.C., chapters 40&#x2013;55 presupposing the exile of the sixth century, and chapters 56&#x2013;66 presupposing the eventual return from exile. While taking this scholarship into account Oswalt defends the unity of the prophetic book and argues convincingly that the whole book can be attributed to the Isaiah of the eighth century.<br><br> The commentary proper, based on Oswalt's own translation of the Hebrew text, provides pastors, scholars, and students with a lucid interpretation of the book of Isaiah in its ancient context as well as an exposition of its message for today.</p><p><b>Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society</b><br> "An excellent conservative commentary on the book of Isaiah. . .

For Warner Brothers, he has written a new version of the horror musical LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS and the live-action adaptation of ARCHIE.Gr 10 Up&#x2014;This horror flick reimagining of Sabrina the Teenage Witch is a lushly cinematic and refreshingly grim departure from the charmingly sweet heroine of yesteryear. This isn't your mother's teenage witch: although Sabrina is dealing with common adolescent woes, she's also consorting with the devil and feasting on a sacrificial goat. The story takes place in the days before Sabrina's confirmation into the coven, coinciding with her 16th birthday. In the upcoming ceremony, she must choose to either live as an immortal witch, infinitely powerful but incapable of romantic love, or as a mortal, destined to die but also able to spend her life with her dreamboat boyfriend, Harvey. Meanwhile, Madam Satan, a powerful witch with a vendetta against Sabrina's father, is accidentally raised from hell by two familiar Archie-universe figures; Betty and Veronica are wryly reinvented here as ditzy but powerful witches. The five-issue collection ends in a diabolically creepy cliff-hanger. This iteration is set in the 1960s, incorporating the social upheavals of the time while visually alluding to Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and other paranormal horror films. Hack's scratched filmstrip style, set in sepia tones, makes the inevitable violent splashes of red provocatively grotesque. Some nudity and violence make this more appropriate for older teens. VERDICT Deftly balancing suspense, violence, and wit, this is a welcome and frightening addition for lovers of horror, suspense, and graphic novels; hand to fans of Emily Carroll's Through the Woods and followers of The Walking Dead.&#x2014;Anna Murphy, Berkeley Carroll School, Brooklyn</p><h2>Secrets of the Great Old-Timey Cooks: Historic Recipes, Lore &amp; Wisdom</h2><p>Reminisce about a simpler time as four 20th century mountain pioneer women share their cooking secrets.

He traveled to India, where he discussed nirvana with Buddha, and to the warring states of Cathay, where he learned of Tao from Master Li and fished on the riverbank with Confucius. Now blind and aged in Athens&#x2013;the Athens of Pericles, Sophocles, Thucydides, Herodotus, and Socrates&#x2013;Cyrus recounts his days as he strives to resolve the fundamental questions that have guided his life&#x2019;s journeys: how the universe was created, and why evil was created with good. In revisiting the fifth century b.c.&#x2013;one of the most spectacular periods in history&#x2013;Gore Vidal illuminates the ideas that have shaped civilizations for millennia.<i><br></i></p><p>In 445 B.C., Cyrus Spitama, the grandson of the prophet Zoroaster, is the Persian ambassador to the city of Athens. He has a rather caustic appreciation of his situation: "I am blind. But I am not deaf. Because of the incompleteness of my misfortune, I was obliged yesterday to listen for nearly six hours to a self-styled historian whose account of what the Athenians like to call 'the Persian Wars' was nonsense of a sort that were I less old and more privileged, I would have risen to my seat at the Odeon and scandalized all Athens by answering him." Having thus dismissed Herodotus, Cyrus then dictates his life story to his nephew, Democritus, with similar disdain for the Greeks--whom we in the modern world have come to view as the progenitors of civilization, but whom Cyrus considers to be bad-smelling rabble.<p> Of course, Cyrus Spitama speaks with a very modern, ironic voice supplied to him by Gore Vidal--and the political intrigues in which Cyrus finds himself immersed are likewise familiar territory for fans of Vidal's historical fiction. But the narrator's delightfully wicked observations are the icing on a narrative of truly epic scope--out of his desire to understand the origins of the world, Cyrus undertakes journeys to India, where he encounters disciples of the Buddha, and China, where he engages Confucius in philosophical conversation while the great sage fishes by the riverside. <i>Creation</i> offers insights into classical history laced with scintillating wit and narrative brio.</p>&#x201c;An incredibly detailed and convincing picture of the ancient world.&#x201d; &#x2013;Anthony Burgess<br><br>&#x201c;Brilliantly realized. . . .

Decolonising the Camera trains Mark Sealy&#39;s sharp critical eye on the racial politics at work within photography, in the context of heated discussions around race and representation, the legacies of colonialism, and the importance of decolonising the university. Sealy analyses a series of images within and against the violent political reality of Western imperialism, and aims to extract new meanings and develop new ways of seeing that bring the Other into focus. The book demonstrates that if we do not recognise the historical and political conjunctures of racial politics at work within photography, and their effects on those that have been culturally erased, made invisible or less than human by such images, then we remain hemmed within established orthodoxies of colonial thought concerning the racialised body, the subaltern and the politics of human recognition. With detailed analyses of photographs - included in an insert - by Alice Seeley Harris, Joy Gregory, Rotimi Fani-Kayode and others, and spanning more than 100 years of photographic history, Decolonising the Camera contains vital visual and written material for readers interested in photography, race, human rights and the effects of colonial violence.</p><p></p><h2>There Should Be Flowers</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Espinoza&#x2019;s debut<em>&nbsp;</em>is a searing interrogation of the world and the self at once.

So his mother tells the amazing and miraculous story of Jesus' birth. Along the way, Christopher learns the answers to important questions about Christmas.

Maier instead sets the story in the American West, where a curious 8-year-old boy named Christopher wants a "real" bedtime story. His mother then tells him the miraculous story of the Nativity.

He speaks and writes the language of the punk music that defined him. He is extreme alpinist Mark Twight, and he doesn't back down from the truth. He's a one-man literary punk band. If you have any doubt, here comes his knockout punch: the only collection of writing Twight swears he'll ever publish. <br> <br> <em>Kiss or Kill: Confessions of a Serial Climber</em> is raw, unfiltered Twight. These author's cut are the real deal, not the homogenized fluff offered up by magazine editors who are often unwilling to offend. Twight's words make it clear that climbing is only distantly about the summit. Several of these pieces are new to U.S. readers. Twight edited all of the selections and appended each with a current author's note; confessing his inspiration, events that followed, and lessons learned (or not learned, some might say). It adds up to a frightfully lucid look into Twight's personal life as both man and hardcore alpine climber. The dissection scares me sometimes...<p></p> <p>Whether railing against the spinelessness of American siege-style mountaineering, admitting addiction to pushing the bounds of the possible, or reveling in his ability to cut away anything in life that holds him back, Twight never blinks. Along the way, there is the drama of new and epic routes, unbreakable bonds between climbing partners, and Twight's evolution as a climber and a man. He tells every story in a unique, in-your-face style. </p> <p><em>Kiss or Kill</em> is not an easy read. It may scare some readers-but that's the point. "I want this book to help you recognize your own anger, which will help you understand mine", says Twight. "Somewhere out there somebody understands these words and knows they matter. They were written in blood, learned by heart."</p></p><p><strong>MARK TWIGHT</strong> is one of America's leading alpinists. His gripping accounts have been published around the world and translated into five languages. He is also the author of the best-selling book <i>Extreme Alpinism: Climbing Light, High and Fast,</i> from The Mountaineers Books.Read [Kiss or Kill] if you have alpine ambitions -- or have a disturbed mind. It's a good read, and you might gleen some perspective from it. (<i>Scree</i>)<br><br>If you've delved into the growing body of mountaineering literature by reading books like Jon Krakauer's <i>Into Thin Air</i> ... be forewarned: They're like Billy Joel; <b>Kiss or Kill</b> is like the Dead Kennedys ... Prodding the deepest recesses of fear the way he'd stab a wafer-thin ice runnel with the pick of his axe, Twight's <b>Kiss or Kill</b> is an engaging read. (<i>The Vancouver Sun</i>)<br><br>With chapter titles such as 'House of Pain' and 'I Hurt, Therefore I Am,' no one would mistake Twight for a member of the Von Trapp family. A bracing tonic for us desk-bound wussies. (<i>Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</i>)<br><br>[Twight] is brutally honest, and nobody, including his friends or himself, is safe from his high standards and criticism. Many of these [collected pieces] are gems and shed new light on his earlier work...

From the Pacific to the Atlantic by the Lincoln Highway, with California and the Virginias and Maryland thrown in for good measure! What a tour it has been! As we think back over its miles we recall the noble pines and the towering Sequoias of the high Sierras of California; the flashing water-falls of the Yosemite, so green as to be called Vernal, so white as to be called Bridal Veil; the orchards of the prune, the cherry, the walnut, the olive, the almond, the fig, the orange, and the lemon, tilled like a garden, watered by the hoarded and guarded streams from the everlasting hills; and the rich valleys of grain, running up to the hillsides and dotted by live oak trees. The Lincoln Highway was one of the earliest transcontinental highways for automobiles across the United States of America.[1] Conceived in 1912 by Indiana entrepreneur Carl G. Fisher, and formally dedicated October 31, 1913, the Lincoln Highway ran coast-to-coast from Times Square in New York City west to Lincoln Park in San Francisco, originally through 13 states: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, and California. In 1915, the &#34;Colorado Loop&#34; was removed, and in 1928, a realignment relocated the Lincoln Highway through the northern tip of West Virginia. Thus, there are a total of 14 states, 128 counties, and more than 700 cities, towns and villages through which the highway passed at some time in its history. The first officially recorded length of the entire Lincoln Highway in 1913 was 3,389 miles (5,454 km).[a] Over the years, the road was improved and numerous realignments were made,[3] and by 1924 the highway had been shortened to 3,142 miles (5,057 km). Counting the original route and all of the subsequent realignments, there have been a grand total of 5,872 miles (9,450 km).[4] The Lincoln Highway was gradually replaced with numbered designations after the establishment of the U.S. Numbered Highway System in 1926, with most of the route becoming part of U.S. Route 30 from Pennsylvania to Wyoming. After the Interstate Highway System was formed in the 1950s, the former alignments of the Lincoln Highway were largely superseded by Interstate 80 as the primary coast-to-coast route from the New York City area to San Francisco.</p><p></p><h2>Hell: A Final Word</h2><p>Today, hell is a front-burner topic, thanks to media attention stirred by megapastors Rob Bell, Francis Chan, and others. But, between the extremes of universal salvation and everlasting torment, there shines a third view, known as annihilationism or conditional immortality, claiming the most biblical support of all.<p>Now the man whose 500-page book, <i>The Fire That Consumes</i>, helped ignite the scholarly debate thirty years ago brings this exciting alternative viewpoint to the everyday reader in simple form.

Death is sure. Judgment is certain. Hell is real. And when John 3:16 says the options are eternal life or perish, we can take that at face value. </p><p> At the end of the world, the good and bad alike are raised to face judgment. The righteous enjoy eternal life with God; the lost are sentenced to hell. But the God who gave his Son to die</p><p> for sinners does not keep them alive forever to torment them without end. Instead, those in hell suffer such precise pains as divine justice may require, in a process that ends in extinction. This is the second death, the wages of sin.

The doctrine of divine attributes, then, is set out as a reflection on Holy Scripture: the One God as omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient, and all these as expressions of the Love who is God. Systematic theology must make bold claims about its knowledge and service of this One LORD: the Invisible God must be seen and known in the visible. In this way, God and God's relation to creation are distinguishedbut not separatedfrom Christology, the doctrine of perfections from redemption. The LORD God will be seen as compatible with creatures, and the divine perfections express formally distinct and unique relations to the world.</p><p>This systematic theology, then, begins from the treatise <i>De Deo Uno</i> and develops the dogma of the Trinity as an expression of divine unicity, on which will depend creation, Christology, and ecclesiology. In the end, the transcendent beauty who is God can be known only in worship and praise.</p></p><p><p><b>Katherine Sonderegger</b> is the William Meade Professor of Theology at Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria, Virginia.

He decides to frame himself for murder, and to seal his fate he hires the most inexperienced lawyer he can find: a reluctant rookie by the name of Mary DiNunzio from the hot Philadelphia firm of Rosato &amp; Associates. But hiring Mary may turn out to be his biggest mistake. She doubts Jack's confession, and her ethics and instincts tell her she can't defend a man who wants to convict himself. Smarter, gutsier, and more persistent than she has any right to be, Mary sets out to prove what really happened&#x2014;because, as any lawyer knows, a case is never as simple as it seems. And nothing is ever certain until the final moment of truth.</p></p><p><i>Moment of Truth</i> begins with what appears to be an open-and-shut case. Jack Newlin, a wealthy attorney with one of the most influential law firms in Philadelphia, killed his wife in a moment of drunken passion, stabbing her repeatedly when she announced she wanted a divorce. Or at least that is what he is claiming to the police.<p> The fact is, Jack is framing himself because he fears his wife's murder was his daughter's crime of passion. Sixteen-year-old Paige Newlin is a successful model whose relationship with her manager-mother had been famously rocky. To make sure that he's convicted, Jack hires rookie lawyer Mary DiNunzio to defend him. But Mary doesn't buy Jack's story, and neither does the senior detective on the case. In a fascinating turn on the usual courtroom tale, then, Jack struggles to maintain his false story of guilt while his lawyer and the police struggle to prove him innocent. Meanwhile, Mary wrestles with both her uncertainty as a lawyer and with her attraction for her client.</p><p> Lisa Scottoline, often identified as the "female John Grisham," has led the pack of female authors in the legal thriller genre, winning an Edgar for her second novel, <i>Final Appeal</i>. <i>Moment of Truth</i> does have moments that don't, in fact, ring true. Why is Jack Newlin so quick to forgive his daughter when he thinks she's killed her own mother? And if he's so concerned with her welfare, why did he absent himself from her upbringing? But it's nonetheless interesting for its innovative plot conceit and its examination of high-profile murder trials. If one is able to overlook the problems with Newlin's motivation, the story Scottoline weaves is a compelling one, and her heroine, Mary, is an enjoyable, self-doubting twist on the super-lawyer at the center of most legal thrillers. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Moment of Truth is the story of a man who frames himself for murder. When attorney Jack Newlin discovers his wife dead in their elegant home, he's convinced he knows who killed her -- and is equally determined to hide the truth.

Mbembe teases out the intellectual consequences of the reality that Europe is no longer the world's center of gravity while mapping the relations among colonialism, slavery, and contemporary financial and extractive capital. Tracing the conjunction of Blackness with the biological fiction of race, he theorizes Black reason as the collection of discourses and practices that equated Blackness with the nonhuman in order to uphold forms of oppression. Mbembe powerfully argues that this equation of Blackness with the nonhuman will serve as the template for all new forms of exclusion. With <i>Critique of Black Reason</i>, Mbembe offers nothing less than a map of the world as it has been constituted through colonialism and racial thinking while providing the first glimpses of a more just future.&nbsp;</p><p>Achille Mbembe is Research Professor in History and Politics at the Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. He is coeditor of <i>Johannesburg: The Elusive Metropolis</i>, also published by Duke University Press, and the author of <i>On the Postcolony</i> as well as several books in French.<br> Laurent Dubois is Marcello Lotti Professor of Romance Studies and History and Director of the Forum for Scholars and Publics at Duke University."With <i>Critique of Black Reason</i>, Achille Mbembe reaffirms his position as one of the most original and significant thinkers of our times working out of Francophone traditions of anti-imperial and postcolonial criticism. His voyages in this book through a painstakingly assembled archive of empire, race, slavery, blackness, and liberation&#x2014;an archive that Mbembe both reconfigures and interrogates at the same time&#x2014;produce profound moments of reflection on the origin and nature of modernity and its mutations in the contemporary phase of global capital. A tour de force that will renew debates on capital, race, and freedom in today's world." (Dipesh Chakrabarty)<br><br>"Achille Mbembe speaks authoritatively for black life, addressing the whole world in an increasingly distinctive tone of voice. This long-anticipated book resounds with the embattled, southern predicament from which its precious shards of wisdom originate. There is nothing provincial about the philosopher&#x2019;s history it articulates. Mbembe sketches the entangled genealogies of racism and black thought on their worldly travels from the barracoons and the slave ships, through countless insurgencies, into the vexed mechanisms of decolonization and then beyond them, into our own bleak and desperate circumstances." (Paul Gilroy)<br><br>"Achille Mbembe has placed the discourse of &#x2018;Africa&#x2019; squarely in the center of both postmodernism and continental philosophy. Every page of this signifying riff on Kant's <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> is a delight to read. African philosophy is currently enjoying a renaissance, and Mbembe is to its continental pole what Kwame Anthony Appiah is to its analytical pole. Every student of postmodernist theory should read this book."

Those who retain the art possess the key to good health, vitality and peace of mind, for relaxation is a tonic for the whole being, liberating vast resources of energy.<br><br>The state of our minds and the state of our bodies are intimately linked. If your muscles are relaxed, then your mind must be relaxed. If the mind is anxious, then the body suffers too. All action originates in the mind. When the mind receives a stimulus that alerts it to the need for action, it sends a message via the nerves to contract the muscles in readiness. In the hustle and bustle of the modern world, the mind is continuously bombarded with stimuli which may cause us to freeze in the alerted "fight or flight" pattern of response. As a result, many people spend much of their lives -- even while asleep -- in a state of physical and mental tension. Everyone has their own particular trouble spots -- whether it is a clenched jaw, a furrowed brow, or a stiff neck. This unnecessary tension not only causes a lot of discomfort but is an enormous drain on our energy resources and a major cause of tiredness and ill-health. For energy is being used both to tell the muscles to contract and to keep them contracted, even if we are only half aware of it.<br><br>In this section we present the technique of relaxation, that is an essential part of your yoga practice. There are three parts to proper relaxation -- physical, mental and spiritual relaxation. To relax the body, you lie down in the Corpse Pose and first tense then relax each part of the body in turn, working up from your feet to your head. This alternate tensing then relaxing is necessary because it is only by knowing how tension feels that you can be sure that you have achieved relaxation. Then, just as in normal life your mind instructs the muscles to tense and contract, you now use autosuggestion to send the muscles a message to relax. With practice you will gradually learn to use your subconscious mind to extend this control to the involuntary muscles of the heart, the digestive systems and other organs too.<br><br>To relax and focus the mind you breathe steadily and rhythmically and concentrate on your breathing. Mental and physical relaxation can never be complete, however, until you achieve spiritual peace. For as long as you identify with your body and mind, there will be fears and worries, anger and sorrow. Spiritual relaxation means detaching yourself, becoming a witness of the body and mind, in order to identify with the Self or pure consciousness -- the source of truth and peace that lies within us all.<br><br>As you relax, you will feel sensations of melting down, of expansion, lightness and warmth. When all muscular tension is gone, a gentle euphoria suffuses the whole body. Relaxation is not so much a state as a process, a series of levels of increasing depth. It is a matter of letting go, instead of holding on; of not doing, rather than doing. As you relax the whole body and breathe slowly and deeply, certain physiological changes occur: less oxygen is consumed and less carbon dioxide eliminated; muscle tension is reduced; and there is a decrease in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and an increase in parasympathetic activity. Even a few minutes of deep relaxation will reduce worry and fatigue more effectively than many hours of restless sleep.<br><br><b>The Corpse Pose</b><br><br>The Corpse Pose or Savasana is the classic relaxation pose, practised before each session, between asanas and in Final Relaxation. It looks deceptively simple, but it is in fact one of the most difficult asanas to do well and one which changes and develops with practice. At the end of an asana session your Corpse Pose will be more complete than at the beginning because the other asanas will have progressively stretched and relaxed your muscles. When you first lie down, look to see that you are lying symmetrically as symmetry provides proper space for all parts to relax. Now start to work in the pose. Rotate your legs in and out, then let them fall gently out to the sides. Do the same with your arms. Rotate the spine by turning your head from side to side to centre it. Then start stretching yourself out, as though someone were pulling your head away from your feet, your shoulders down and away from your neck, your legs down and away from your pelvis. Let gravity embrace you. Feel your weight pulling you deeper into relaxation, melting your body into the floor. Breathe deeply and slowly from the abdomen, riding up and down on the breath, sinking deeper with each exhalation. Feel how your abdomen swells and falls. Many important physiological changes are taking place, reducing the body's energy loss, removing stress, lowering your respiration and pulse rate, and resting the whole system. As you enter deep relaxation, you will feel your mind grow clear and detached.<br><br>Copyright � 1983, 2000 by Gaia Books Limited<br><br>Text copyright � 1983, 2000 by Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Center</p><h2>Naturally Bug-Free: 75 Nontoxic Recipes for Repelling Mosquitoes, Ticks, Fleas, Ants, Moths &amp; Other Pesky Insects</h2><p>Protect yourself, your children, your pets, and your home from bugs &#x2014; without using harsh or toxic chemicals!

Fast cars. Fast and furious. Fast forward. Fast . . . church? The church is often idealized (or demonized) as the last bastion of a bygone era, dragging our feet as we're pulled into new moralities and new spiritualities. We guard our doctrine and our piety with great vigilance. But we often fail to notice how quickly we're capitulating, in the structures and practices of our churches, to a culture of unreflective speed, dehumanizing efficiency and dis-integrating isolationism. In the beginning, the church ate together, traveled together and shared in all facets of life. Centered as they were on Jesus, these seemingly mundane activities took on their own significance in the mission of God. In <em>Slow Church,</em> Chris Smith and John Pattison invite us to leave franchise faith behind and enter into the ecology, economy and ethics of the kingdom of God, where people know each other well and love one another as Christ loved the church.</p><p>Chris Smith is editor of <em>The Englewood Review of Books</em> and a member of the Englewood Christian Church community on the urban Near Eastside of Indianapolis."The authors write clearly and persuasively; each section of the book offers a theoretical and scriptural basis for the ideas discussed and practical suggestions for their implementation." (Publishers Weekly STARRED REVIEW, April 14, 2014)<br><br>"<em>Slow Church</em> is a manifesto and handbook rolled into one. Unlike most manifestos, it is beautifully written, blending historical analysis, personal narrative, and scriptural exegesis into prose that is languid, incisive, and eloquent. It reads like what it is: the long, patient fruit of two men deeply rooted in a particular place, among neighbors they know, love, and serve. . . . No matter the size of our church body or the kind of neighborhood we live in, we would all do well to slow down and examine ourselves in the clearest light available&#x2015;the light of history, the light of Scripture, and the light of Christ himself&#x2015;rather than the fluorescent light of business models and burger joints. Make haste, then. Run, do not walk, to your favorite bookstore, buy a copy, and set your church table for a feast." (Leslie Leyland Fields, Christianity Today, September 2014)<br><br>"<em>Slow Church</em> explores being church in a way that emphasizes deep engagement in local people and places, quality over quantity, and in all things taking the long view&#x2015;understanding individuals and congregations as participants in the unfolding drama of all creation. . . . The strength of this book is in its consistent encouragement to reorient ourselves through prayer, scripture, and practice to God's abundant gifts and wellspring of possibilities, even in broken places and circumstances. While the generative imaginative space this creates doesn't work miracles (remember, we're talking slow) on tight church budgets, neighbors struggling with an exploitative landlord, or conflict in community, it does open us up to material and spiritual resources we might otherwise overlook and remind us that transformation, though it may be a long time coming, is promised to us and all creation. . . . For inspiration you may find yourself returning to this gracefully written ode to God's wonders close at hand, with its vision for individuals and faith communities to savor that goodness and more fully incarnate Christ's love, wherever we have been called to be." (Julie Polter, Sojourners, September/October 2014)<br><br>"The final chapter of <em>Slow Church</em> envisions, quite biblically and appropriately, church as a shared meal; a 'dinner table conversation as a way of being the church.' Questions that arise during the course of planning a meal&#x2015;<em>What will we eat? Who will do which tasks? Where will we buy the food and who is invited to the table</em>&#x2015;reflect many of the same questions raised throughout the book about the way communities of worship think about and implement their way of being in the world. They are questions worth lingering over, even for those who are content with their current ways of being a part of the church, for they invite everyone to a deeper enjoyment of and engagement with the often-strange experience that <em>is</em> church." (Rachel Marie Stone, Books Culture, September/October 2014)<br><br>"Inspired by the 'slow food' movement and disheartened by the 'fast' church trends, Smith and Pattison are advocating for 'reimagining what it means to be communities of believers gathered and rooted in particular places at a particular time.' <em>Slow Church</em> promises something richer and more substantive than quick fixes." (Relevant Magazine, May/June 2014)<br><br>"At long last, a book I relish giving away to the vast number of people longing for an alternative between 'McDonald Church' and the end of the church altogether. In neighborhoods across North America there are hundreds of thousands of Christ-followers trying to experiment with a new way of being the church in everyday life. Now there is a hopeful guidebook that is rich with empirical and anecdotal research, historical depth and theological savvy that can guide their way. This is the book you rush out and buy a dozen copies of to give hope and help to your friends who want to follow the way of Jesus." (Paul Sparks, coauthor of The New Parish and cofounder of Parish Collective)<br><br>"Smith and Pattison marshal the wisdom of our greatest cultural thinkers&#x2015;people like Berry, Heschel, Pollan and Vanier&#x2015;in this tour-de-force manifesto. This smart book reveals the vacuity of fast church and realigns us with the locality, rest, unpredictability and simple delight that comes with the way of Jesus." (Jon M. Sweeney, author of When Saint Francis Saved the Church)<br><br>"In this agitated and anxious world, our worth is determined by our productivity and our value is measured by how much we can devour. Without much thought, even our churches have become tangled up in our quick-consumption mentality. In the midst of the greedy mindlessness of ministry, C. Christopher Smith and John Pattison evoke a different vision&#x2015;one of a careful community of deep relationships. As a pastor, I lingered over the words of <em>Slow Church</em> with delight as they inspired me and made me welcome what we might become." (Carol Howard Merritt, pastor, author of Reframing Hope and Tribal Church)<br><br>"Hurry, worry, stress and striving have come to dominate human consciousness in the twenty-first century&#x2015;the logical consequences of a society built on individualism and productivity at any cost. We long for a pace of life that allows us to enjoy deep relationships, meaningful work, spiritual vitality and the simple pleasures of life. In <em>Slow Church,</em> Pattison and Smith offer a hopeful vision of the future, rooted in the Christian gospel, that provides a comprehensive orientation for pursuing a more integrative path. This book tenderly calls common assumptions about the church and society into question, carefully synthesizing Christian theology with emerging ecological consciousness. For the sake of our souls, our grandchildren and the planet, I hope we pay attention to Smith and Pattison's conclusions and take action." (Mark Scandrette, author of Free and Practicing the Way of Jesus)<br><br>"All of our churches are shaped by our cultural environments, and Smith and Pattison note how forces such as fragmentation, impatience, commodification, branding, hypermobility, individualism and efficiency too often dominate our practices and priorities. So we strive for control in the midst of fears and self-protection. <em>Slow Church</em> provides theology and imagination that connect gospel embodiment with place and neighbors, calling us to slower lives around tables and conversations that nourish and interweave gratefulness, listening, work, hospitality, justice and the biblical trajectory toward the reconciliation of all things. Less of McDonalds; more of sabbath feasts." (Mark Lau Branson, Homer L. Goddard Professor of the Ministry of the Laity, Fuller Seminary)</p><h2>Suffering and the Search for Meaning: Contemporary Responses to the Problem of Pain</h2><p>Suffering is a philosophical problem, but it is much more. It is deeply personal. Why is this happening to <em>me</em>? How can I respond to friends and family in pain and loss, and to people in my care? Richard Rice guides readers through the seven most significant theodicies&#x2015;approaches that have been used to make sense of suffering in light of God's justice or control. He considers the strengths and weaknesses of each option, while always guiding us toward greater understanding and compassion. Rice goes further by offering guidelines for constructing a personal framework for dealing practically with suffering, one that draws from philosophy, ethics, theology and real-world experience. Intending for each of us to find a response to our suffering that is both intellectually satisfying and personally authentic, Rice provides the resources for meeting this challenge. He weaves together the theoretical side of the theodicies with personal stories of people who have experienced great suffering. While no framework can perfectly account for the problem of pain, we are left with the overarching insight that suffering never has the final word.</p><p>Richard Rice is professor of religion at Loma Linda University in Loma Linda, California. He is the author of several books, including <em>God?s Foreknowledge and Man?s Free Will</em> and <em>Reason and the Contours of Faith</em>."The 'why me? why now?' question is probably the most common response of people undergoing serious illness or loss. There are no answers to these questions, just the assurance that with time, and in the presence of compassionate clinicians, chaplains and loved ones, people may find answers for themselves. Rice's book provides a theological roadmap for patients in their reflections on their suffering to assist them in their journey toward inner peace and healing." (Christina M. Puchalski, professor of medicine and health sciences, director of The George Washington Institute for Spirituality and Health, The George Washington University)<br><br>"Those who suffer know two things: that suffering calls for silence and that, eventually, it seeks to be understood. Richard Rice respects this double knowledge, honors the limits of what we can say in a crisis and humbly surveys a range of responses to suffering to help his readers speak faithfully in and of pain&#x2015;their own, and others'." (Matt Jenson, Torrey Honors Institute, Biola University)<br><br>"Never have I read a philosophical reflection that identifies so deeply with the experience of human suffering. Rice explores the greatest answers to the question, why does God allow suffering? in light of that experience. Here, finally, is a resource for caregivers and those who seek to understand how so much pain could exist in a divinely created world." (Philip Clayton, author of Transforming Christian Theology)<br><br>"<em>Suffering and the Search for Meaning</em> is a beautiful book. Richard Rice writes gracefully, gently, wisely and sensitively about this most troubling and persistent problem&#x2015;the pain and suffering of our lives and the lives of those we love. Rice provides a careful and accessible engagement with the most enduring 'solutions' that theologians and philosophers have offered to this problem. He is always careful to give each one its best hearing but never shies away from probing the weaknesses of a particular theodicy. He draws effortlessly and poignantly from popular culture, literature and yesterday's headlines to provide lively illustrations of his ideas. To read this book is to be guided gently, and to be addressed with respect and dignity, by one of the truly gifted pastoral theologians of our day." (Michael Lodahl, professor of theology and world religions, Point Loma Nazarene University)<br><br>"Pain and suffering are integral to human life, but never easy to understand or to deal with. Richard Rice's <em>Suffering and the Search for Meaning</em> brings a new dimension to reflection on the meaning of suffering, one deeply imbued with the best theological and philosophical thinking, but also attuned to contemporary human experience. After a clear analysis of the advantages and drawbacks of six classic options, he argues for a practical theodicy that does not try to make final sense of suffering but that helps those in the midst of suffering to respond in a resourceful way that will enhance the meaning of life." (Bernard McGinn, Naomi Shenstone Donnelley Professor Emeritus, Divinity School, University of Chicago)<br><br>"Writing on the problem of suffering, Richard Rice combines a philosopher's keen intellect with a pastoral heart to produce an incisive and helpful book. The work is clear, down to earth, and useful for those who suffer or are troubled by the fact of suffering in our world. The many illustrations from real life are illuminating, and the discussions of the various approaches to evil are fair and sensible. I recommend the book highly." (Stephen T. Davis,&nbsp;Russell K. Pitzer Professor of Philosophy, Claremont McKenna College)<br><br>"Richard Rice brings together two things often separated: philosophical and theological explanations for suffering, and the practical struggle of persons trying to make sense of suffering in their own lives or the lives of others close to them. He surveys seven widely embraced approaches and concludes with a thoughtful chapter that provides guidance on developing one's personal response to suffering. An open theist himself, Rice is remarkably even-handed in describing how each of the approaches offers comfort as well as puzzles and unanswered questions. This book provides a rich resource both for those trying to understand their own suffering and for those who work with them and minister to them." (William Hasker, emeritus professor of philosophy, Huntington University)<br><br>"Rice presents an accessible and even-handed overview of the dominant responses to pain and evil. I especially appreciate his bringing together the practical and theoretical aspects, as he weaves together stories and ideas. This book helps to round out the kind of conversations we all end up having about God, pain and the relationship between the two!" (Thomas Jay Oord,&nbsp;author of The Nature of Love: A Theology)<br><br>"Questions about suffering never go away, nor do our attempts to explain it and live courageously in spite of it. Among the myriad of books on the topic, Richard Rice's is distinguished by its union of theoretical and personal concerns&#x2015;by the way it brings together the concrete experience of suffering and the different ways careful thinkers have tried to explain its presence in the world. Accessible and practical, as well as philosophically informed, <em>Suffering and the Search for Meaning</em> will be of great value to physicians and other care providers as they seek to understand and respond to the full range of their clients' needs." (Harold G. Koenig, MD, professor of psychiatry and director of the Center for Spirituality, Theology and Health, Duke University Medical Center)<br><br>"I know of no better brief summary, analysis and critique of contemporary approaches to the problem of evil. Rice clearly knows which approaches he favors, but his treatments of all are fair and informative. This should become a standard text in courses on philosophy of religion as well as a useful resource for anyone interested in theodicy." (Roger E. Olson,&nbsp;George W.

A glance at the clock told him he was already ten minutes late to meet up with the girls in the bar for a predinner beverage.<br> <br>When the doorbell to his stateroom buzzed, he gave up, dropped the ends of the still untied tie, and pounded the dresser top in frustration. The blow sent one of his cuff links skittering across the polished wood surface and onto the carpeted floor, where it immediately disappeared from view under the bed. Roger was on his hands and knees searching for the missing cuff link when Reynaldo, his cabin butler, stuck his head around the doorjamb.<br> <br>&#x201c;Turndown service,&#x201d; he announced. &#x201c;Or would you rather I come back at another time?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Roger muttered. &#x201c;Now&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I help you with something?&#x201d; Reynaldo asked solicitously.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve lost my damned cuff link, and I can&#x2019;t for the life of me tie my damned tie.&#x201d;<br> <br>Crouching at the foot of the bed, Reynaldo quickly retrieved the missing cuff link and dropped it into Roger&#x2019;s over-sized fist. Leaning on the bed, Roger heaved himself upright. &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Appreciate it.&#x201d; And he did.<br> <br>&#x201c;As for the tie,&#x201d; Reynaldo offered, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be happy to help with that and with the cuff links as well.&#x201d;<br> <br>Feeling embarrassed and self-conscious at his own obvious incompetence, Roger surrendered himself to Reynaldo&#x2019;s ministrations. It took only a matter of seconds and a few deft movements on Reynaldo&#x2019;s part before the tie was properly tied.<br> <br>The butler stood back for a moment to admire his handiwork. &#x201c;Cuff links next,&#x201d; he said, and Roger handed them over. Once the cuff links were fastened, Reynaldo retrieved the jacket from the bed and held it up so Roger could slip into it. The jacket settled smoothly onto Roger&#x2019;s massive shoulders as though it had been made for him&#x2014;because it had. Aunt Julia had seen to that.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going on a cruise, Rog,&#x201d; she had told him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need a tux for formal nights on board, and by God you&#x2019;re going to have one.&#x201d; A lifetime&#x2019;s worth of experience had taught Roger that arguing with Aunt Julia was a losing proposition. He&#x2019;d gone straight out and ordered the tux. At Aunt Julia&#x2019;s urging he&#x2019;d also invested in a new sport coat and some big-and-tall dress shirts as well.<br> <br>&#x201c;After all,&#x201d; Aunt Julia had counseled, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s a two-week cruise. You can&#x2019;t go down to the dining room in the same thing night after night.&#x201d;<br> <br>The big-and-tall shirts were necessary because Roger was a big man. Standing next to him, Reynaldo was tiny by comparison. Once the jacket was properly in place, the butler reached up and dusted off a tiny speck of lint before giving Roger an approving nod.<br> <br>&#x201c;Very good, sir,&#x201d; Reynaldo said. &#x201c;Take a look in the mirror.&#x201d;<br> <br>Turning back to face the mirror where he&#x2019;d spent the better part of forty-five minutes battling with the tie, Roger McGeary was startled to see the reflection staring back at him. He looked . . . well . . . good.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d never worn a tux before. Members of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Club back in high school weren&#x2019;t the kind of kids who went to proms or homecoming dances. And if they did somehow get around to getting married eventually, they didn&#x2019;t do so with a full contingent of bridesmaids and groomsmen. When there had been geeky weddings in Roger&#x2019;s circle of acquaintances, he himself had never been called upon to perform bridal party duties. And so, at the ripe old age of forty and a half, he was astonished to see that the tux made all the difference.<br> <br>Of course, his shoulder-length hair&#x2014;still mostly brown but beginning to go gray&#x2014;was maybe a bit incongruous with the tux, but it was too late to do anything about that now. Besides, Roger had worn his hair that way from the moment he turned twelve and realized that having a son with shoulder-length hair was something that drove his father nuts. Anything that bugged the hell out of James McGeary was exactly what his son would do.<br> <br>Roger grinned at Reynaldo. &#x201c;Thanks for your help,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mention it, sir,&#x201d; the butler replied, beginning the turndown process. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;<br> <br>That was something else his old D &amp; D pals would find �astonishing&#x2014;Roger McGeary on a cruise? In a stateroom with a damned butler? Get out!<br> <br>Feeling somewhat jaunty, Roger stopped long enough to pull his cell phone off the charger and slip it into his jacket pocket. Earlier when he&#x2019;d been looking for directions on the tie, he&#x2019;d noticed that the charge was lower than it should have been, and he&#x2019;d plugged it in while he was showering and shaving. If the phone was losing its ability to hold a charge, he&#x2019;d need to go looking for a new one once he got back home.<br> <br>Roger took the phone along with him to dinner more out of force of habit than because he was expecting calls. After all, he was on vacation, and his office in San Jose, California, was many time zones away. Letting himself out of the cabin, he started toward the elevator lobby. He&#x2019;d taken only a few steps when a sudden pitch sent him bouncing off first one wall and then the other.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s the English Channel, after all, he told himself. What do you expect?<br> <br>His stateroom was fairly well aft. As he tottered down the long corridor, he couldn&#x2019;t help thinking again of the kids he&#x2019;d hung out with back in high school. The only one he still stayed in touch with&#x2014;sometimes by text and occasionally by running into each other at cyber security conferences&#x2014;was Stu Ramey, the guy who had once been Roger&#x2019;s best friend. They had met up in Adams Junior High&#x2014;junior prison, as they called it.<br> <br>Smart, overweight, and both wearing glasses, Roger and Stu had bonded immediately. From junior high on, the nerdy outsiders had been bullied and disparagingly referred to by their classmates as Tweedledum and Tweedledee. That was in Phoenix, where at least he&#x2019;d had a friend or two. Once his mother pulled up stakes, moved Roger to L.A., and dumped him into the zoo that was Sepulveda High School for his senior year, he&#x2019;d had no friends at all, and he had been utterly lost.<br> <br>It was hardly surprising that Roger had never attended any of his high school class reunions. He&#x2019;d still been locked up in a mental health facility in Napa for his tenth. As for the twentieth? Thanks to Aunt Julia, he&#x2019;d been back on his feet by then and had actually received an invitation to the one in L.A., but he&#x2019;d had no interest in attending. He had no friends or happy memories from Sepulveda High, and he doubted anyone from back there remembered him, either. As for South Phoenix High? Kids who had come to the school via the special ed route hadn&#x2019;t exactly been welcomed with open arms. He supposed he could have crashed that reunion, but since his only friend at the time had been Stuart, there wasn&#x2019;t much point.<br> <br>As for Roger? Years of therapy hadn&#x2019;t completely fixed his self-esteem issues or his overweening insecurities, either, although seeing himself in the mirror in his tux was maybe further progress. And the next time he saw Stu, he&#x2019;d have to ask him about the reunion situation. Maybe Stuart Ramey had more balls than Roger did. Maybe he&#x2019;d gone back and braved the ravening horde&#x2014;arrogant jocks, perky cheerleaders, and all.<br> <br>In the elevator lobby, Roger stepped aside for a couple heading back the way he&#x2019;d come. The woman had a decidedly green cast to her skin, and she clung to her companion&#x2019;s arm with something close to a death grip. Roger thanked his lucky stars that he wasn&#x2019;t prone to motion sickness and wondered if any of the girls were, either.<br> <br>Calling his prospective dinner companions &#x201c;girls&#x201d; was a bit of a misnomer. For one thing, they were all north of sixty&#x2014;possibly even north of seventy&#x2014;but very well preserved. In the dining room the previous evening, the first night of the cruise, their four-top table had been next to his two-top by the window. As the wine flowed and plates of food came and went, they noticed that he was on his own. The next thing Roger knew, the three women had drawn him into conversation, asking where was he from, was he traveling solo, and what did he think of the cruise so far? By the time dinner was over, they had invited him to accompany them to the bar for an after-dinner drink, and before the evening ended&#x2014;sometime after midnight&#x2014;he had agreed to join them for the following night&#x2019;s formal dinner.<br> <br>Aunt Julia would have called them &#x201c;classy old broads.&#x201d; They were well dressed, well manicured, and no doubt well heeled. Roger had no doubt that the bits of jewelry on display were the real thing&#x2014;diamonds as opposed to zirconium. So, although he was happy to have been included in their circle, he knew he was completely out of his element.<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t mention to them or to anyone else on board that the two-week cruise, complete with his two-room suite and an attending butler, was a freebie. Roger had detected and successfully prevented a massive data breach that would have thrown the cruise ship line into a nightmare and disrupted their entire reservations system. Not only had he preempted the attack, he&#x2019;d also managed to catch the culprit&#x2014;a disgruntled former employee. As far as Shining Star Cruises was concerned, Roger McGeary was a hero, and they were prepared to treat him as such.<br> <br>When Roger stepped off the elevator on deck five, he stood for a moment, staring in through the open doors of the ship&#x2019;s piano bar, the Starlight Lounge. The place was crowded. The girls&#x2014;Angie, Millie, and Dot&#x2014;had managed to snag seats at the bar and were evidently holding a spot for him. The barman, a cheerful guy named Xavier, caught Roger&#x2019;s eye as he stood in the entryway, nodded, and immediately turned to prepare Roger&#x2019;s preferred beverage&#x2014;Campari and soda&#x2014;which was poured and in position in front of the single open stool before Roger made it across the room.<br> <br>This was only the second night of the cruise, Roger noted, so how was it possible that Xavier recognized individual customers on sight and had already memorized their preferred beverages? Roger was entirely at home in the cyber world in front of keyboards and glowing computer screens, but Xavier&#x2019;s people skills&#x2014;his easy humor and pleasant gift of gab&#x2014;were completely absent from Roger&#x2019;s skill set. He&#x2019;d never be able to be a bartender, never in a million years.<br> <br>Dorothy Campbell, aka Dot, was a divorc�e with a thick southern accent. A little slip of a thing, with brightly hennaed red hair and a slick black sheath dress, she was also the self-proclaimed ringleader of the group. Dot launched herself off her stool and tackled Roger, greeting him with an enthusiastic hug.<br> <br>&#x201c;My goodness gracious,&#x201d; she said, looking him up and down. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t clean up nice.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why, thank you, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Roger replied, trying to match her accent with a sort of ersatz cowboy gallantry and then flushing in embarrassment because he felt like he&#x2019;d already made a jackass of himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not just having Campari and soda, are you?&#x201d; she demanded. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t you have something a little higher octane than that? How about joining us in a Kir Royale?&#x201d;<br> <br>That&#x2019;s what the girls had been drinking at the bar the previous night, and that&#x2019;s what they were having tonight as well. Roger wasn&#x2019;t much of a drinker, and he didn&#x2019;t do drugs, either&#x2014;any kind of drugs other than his doctor-prescribed antidepressants&#x2014;but he&#x2019;d allowed himself to be persuaded. Once he&#x2019;d made it back to the room the previous night, he&#x2019;d looked up &#x201c;Kir Royale,&#x201d; which turned out to be a heady combo of champagne and cr�me de cassis. Roger had attempted to tell them that he couldn&#x2019;t dance&#x2014;wouldn&#x2019;t dance. With a couple of Kir Royales under his belt, they had managed to cajole him onto the dance floor, sometimes with all three of them at once. By the time the girls had wished him good night, everybody had been flying high&#x2014;Roger included.<br> <br>&#x201c;See you tomorrow,&#x201d; Dot had admonished him, shaking a finger in his face on her way out. &#x201c;Drinks in the bar at seven; dinner at seven-forty-five. Don&#x2019;t be late.&#x201d;<br> <br>Xavier had watched the three women leave the bar and head tipsily for the elevator. Shaking his head in mock sympathy, he turned to Roger. &#x201c;I believe you have your hands full, sir. Would you care for a refill?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Those were a little stiff for me,&#x201d; Roger had told him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better not.&#x201d;<br> <br>Now in the predinner cocktail hour, canap�s came and went, and so did a second Campari and soda and finally a third. When seating at the bar proved too noisy for conversation, Dot commandeered a nearby table. In the ensuing conversation, Roger began to learn a bit about his companions. The three women were old college chums who had all attended Wellesley and had stayed friends through thick and thin ever since, including taking two-week cruises together each and every year.<br> <br>Roger didn&#x2019;t know exactly where Wellesley was, but he was pretty sure going there was a pricey proposition. And knowing how much the cruise cost on the open market, he estimated there had been a whole lot more thick in the women&#x2019;s lives than there had been thin. Dot had a cabin&#x2014;a Star Suite like his&#x2014;all to herself, while Angie and Millie bunked together in the next category down, a Veranda Stateroom. In the bar and again when they moved into the dining room, Roger listened to their harmless dinnertime chatter, feeling as though he was being given a window into another world, one he&#x2019;d never even imagined.<br> <br>Somewhere between courses three and four, between the mixed green salad and the pappardelle pasta, Roger came to the realization that these women had most likely been contemporaries of his late mother, may she rot in hell. Unlike Eloise McGeary, however, the girls actually seemed to like him.<br> <br>After the surf-and-turf main course&#x2014;prime rib and lobster&#x2014;and dessert&#x2014;a delectable flan topped with a layer of crisp caramel and three perfect raspberries&#x2014;Roger felt the buzz of an incoming text. But the wine had been flowing&#x2014;white followed by red&#x2014;and he was on vacation. If someone from work wanted to be in touch, they could damned well wait. And if it was Aunt Julia? Well, then, she could wait, too. It was afternoon in Payson, Arizona, and she&#x2019;d be out looking after her horses. Taking the phone out of his pocket but without bothering to look at the screen, he powered it off.<br> <br>Once dinner was over, the group migrated back to the bar, where a piano player accompanied a talented vocalist who sang everything from Patsy Cline to the Beatles. The passengers were mostly of an earlier vintage, Roger noted, and so was the music.<br> <br>A couple of hours went by, and more than a little booze passed Roger&#x2019;s lips, booze that was definitely of the high-octane variety. Halfway through his third Courvoisier, he realized that Millie and Angie had both disappeared from the picture, and he was left with an increasingly aggressive Dot, who was feeling him up in a most insistent and suggestive fashion. Roger was just drunk enough to find it laughable that this very spry older woman was hitting on him, but once she mentioned, not so coyly, that he was the &#x201c;only fresh meat&#x201d; to be found on board, it didn&#x2019;t seem ...</p><h2>Healthy Congregations: A Systems Approach</h2><p>In this sequel to How Your Church Family Works, Peter Steinke takes readers into a deeper exploration of the congregation as an emotional system.

Accordingly, the commentary raises new questions and re-directs more traditional questions in fresh and innovative ways, offering new angles of approach. <br><br>This comprehensive, cutting-edge commentary is prefaced by an introductory essay by Professor Mary Tolbert. Contributors draw on feminist, queer, de-constructionist, utopian theories, the social sciences and historical-critical discourses. The focus is both how reading from lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or transgender perspectives affect the reading and interpretation of biblical texts and how biblical texts have and do affect lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or transgender communities. The commentary includes an extensive bibliography that directs the reader to a full range of literature relating to queer interpretation of scripture.</p><p>Dr Deryn Guest is Lecturer in Biblical Hermeneutics at the University of Birmingham.

In rich countries, obesity is now a more serious problem than hunger. Consumers once satisfied with cheap and convenient food now want food that is also safe, nutritious, fresh, and grown by local farmers using fewer chemicals. Heavily subsidized and underregulated commercial farmers are facing stronger push back from environmentalists and consumer activists, and food companies are under the microscope. Meanwhile, agricultural success in Asia has spurred income growth and dietary enrichment, but agricultural failure in Africa has left one-third of all citizens undernourished - and the international markets that link these diverse regions together are subject to sudden disruption. <br><br>The second edition of <em>Food Politics</em> has been thoroughly updated to reflect the latest developments and research on today's global food landscape, including biofuels, the international food market, food aid, obesity, food retailing, urban agriculture, and food safety. The second edition also features an expanded discussion of the links between water, climate change, and food, as well as farming and the environment. New chapters look at livestock, meat and fish and the future of food politics. <br><br>Paarlberg's book challenges myths and critiques more than a few of today's fashionable beliefs about farming and food. For those ready to have their thinking about food politics informed and also challenged, this is the book to read.</p><p><p><b><em>WHAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW About This Series</em></b></p> <p><b>Who it's for:</b></p> <p> Busy people with diverse interests, ranging from college students to professionals, who wish to inform themselves in a succinct yet authoritative manner about a particular topic.</p> <p><b>What's inside:</b></p> <p>An incisive approach to a complex and timely issue, laid out in a straight-forward, question-and-answer format.</p> <p><b>Meet Our Authors</b></p> <p> Top experts in their given fields, ranging from an <i>Economist</i> correspondent to a director at the Council on Foreign Relations, you can trust our authors&#x2019; expertise and guidance.</p> <p><b>Popular Topics in the "<i>What Everyone Needs to Know</i>" Series</b></p> <ul> <li>International Politics</li> <li>Environmental Policies</li> <li>World History</li> <li>Sciences &amp; Math</li> <li>Religion &amp; Spirituality</li> </ul><br><strong>Robert Paarlberg</strong> is Betty Freyhof Johnson Class of 1944 Professor of Political Science at Wellesley College and Adjunct Professor of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and Associate at Harvard's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.

Both disability studies and queer theory are centrally concerned with how bodies, pleasures, and identities are represented as &#x201c;normal&#x201d; or as abject, but Crip Theory is the first book to analyze thoroughly the ways in which these interdisciplinary fields inform each other.<br>Drawing on feminist theory, African American and Latino/a cultural theories, composition studies, film and television studies, and theories of globalization and counter-globalization, Robert McRuer articulates the central concerns of crip theory and considers how such a critical perspective might impact cultural and historical inquiry in the humanities. Crip Theory puts forward readings of the Sharon Kowalski story, the performance art of Bob Flanagan, and the journals of Gary Fisher, as well as critiques of the domesticated queerness and disability marketed by the Millennium March, or Bravo TV&#x2019;s Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. McRuer examines how dominant and marginal bodily and sexual identities are composed, and considers the vibrant ways that disability and queerness unsettle and re-write those identities in order to insist that another world is possible.</p></p><p><b>Robert McRuer</b> is Professor of English at The George Washington University.

Her earlier cookbook, Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow-Cooker, established her bona fides as an expert on the creative use of slow-cookers, and her entire body of work speaks to her ingenuity in the kitchen and the breadth of enticing ingredients and flavors with which she works. Fresh from the Vegan Slow-Cooker provides practical guidence on how to work with different models of slow-cookers, taking into account the sizes of various machines, the variety of settings they offer, and the quirks and personalities of each device. She addresses any lingering skepticism readers may have about whether slow-cookers can have delicious, meat-free applications, and she shows how to take into account the water content of vegetables and the absorptive qualities of grains when vegan slow-cooking. Fresh from the Vegan Slow-Cooker includes eleven recipe chapters, four of which focus on main courses. There are homey and comforting foods in the American and European style, such as a Rustic Pot Pie Topped with Chive Biscuits and a Ziti with Mushroom and Bell Pepper Ragu, and there are lots of East Asian, South and Southeast Asian, and Mexican/Latin dishes, too. Beans, which cook slowly under any circumstance, are fabulously well-suited to the slow cooker, and Robertson includes such appealing recipes as a Crockery Cassoulet and a Greek-Style Beans with Tomatoes and Spinach. Eighteen robust chilis and stews - two more categories that do well in the slow-cooker - include a warming Chipotle Black Bean Chili with Winter Squash and a surprising but yummy Seitan Stroganoff. Beyond the mains, there are chapters devoted to snacks and appetizers, desserts, breads and breakfasts, and even one on drinks. The many soy-free and gluten-free recipes are clearly identified. Altogether, the collection offers readers loads of ways to expand their vegan repertoire and to get maximum value from their investment in a slow-cooker.</p><p>Robin Robertson is a veteran restaurant chef, cooking teacher, and an acclaimed writer. She pens a regular column for VegNews Magazine and has written for Vegetarian Times, Health Naturally, Restaurant Business, National Culinary Review, American Culinary Federation Magazine, and Better Nutrition. She has written numerous cookbooks including the best-selling titles Vegan Planet, Vegan on the Cheap, and Quick-Fix Vegan. Robertson currently writes, promotes her books, and teaches classes on her innovative vegan cuisine from her home in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, where she lives with her husband and two cats. Her website is robinrobertson.com.<br> Introduction The irresistible appeal of a slow-cooker is its convenience and simplicity. Turn it on, and it cooks dinner while you do other things. You have no pot to watch. It doesnt burn or spill over. Just set it and let it do its work. Next thing you know, your kitchen smells heavenly, like a home-cooked meal, and you feel like your personal chef did all the work. Slow-cookers first appeared in the 1970s, and you could get your crock pot in harvest gold, avocado green, or maybe decorated with orange flowers. Back then, the Crock-Pot (as the Rival Company, which is now a brand of Sunbeam Products, trademarked it) was mostly favored for cooking tough cuts of meat. The Crock-Pot left the limelight for a while, but in 2002, when I wrote my first slow-cooker cookbook <i>(Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow Cooker</i>, The Harvard Common Press), slow-cookers were enjoying a comeback. The goal of my first slow cooker book was to show how versatile slow-cookers are for vegetarian cooking and&nbsp;can be used to prepare everything from breakfast to dessert. Fast forward ten years from that first book, and the popularity of slow-cookers shows no sign of waning. In addition, more people are enjoying a plant-based diet than ever before. Since that first slow-cooker cookbook was published, I've written many other titles, but I never stopped developing new recipes, discovering new techniques, and exploring new ideas for vegan slow-cooking. As I've explored new ways to use the slow-cooker for plant-based meals, I've been continually amazed at the effectiveness of slow cookers for vegan recipes. Over the years, I have developed scores of new recipes and explored the worlds cuisines to discover more creative ways to prepare food using the slow-cooker method. What I came up with was enough to fill another book. I'm pleased and proud, therefore, to present this new book to you. It contains more than 200 recipes using only plant-based ingredients. I've also included pages of basic information and lots of new tips and pointers for making the most of your slow cooker experience. I've worked hard to make the recipes accessible using most sizes of slow-cookers. In addition to being 100 percent plant-based, many of the recipes are also gluten-free, soy-free, or low in fat. We all know that a slow-cooker is ideal for cooking beans, soups, and stews, but as you explore the pages of&nbsp;<i>Fresh&nbsp;From the Vegan&nbsp;Slow-Cooker</i>, you'll discover a whole new slow-cooking world. The slow-cooker can be used to make braised vegetable dishes, comforting casseroles, luxurious risottos, and fun dips and snacks. It can even be used to bake potatoes, breads, pates, and desserts. <p>With chapters on everything from appetizers to main dishes, desserts, and beverages, theres something for everyones breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My new book picks up where my previous book left off and elevates vegan slow-cooking to a higher level. I love to cook in my slow-cooker, and I hope that after you try some of these recipes, you will too.</p><br></p><h2>The Moon by Night: Book Two of The Austin Family Chronicles (Austin Family, 2)</h2><p><p><b>Book two of the Austin Family Chronicles, an award-winning young adult series from Madeleine L&#x2019;Engle, author of<i> A Wrinkle in Time</i>, about a girl who experiences the difficulties and joys of growing up.</b><br><b></b><br><b></b><b>&#x201c;Everyone who remembers <i>Meet the Austins</i> as a delightful family story will want to read . . . this wise, beautifully written novel.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Chicago Tribune</i></b></p><p>As if simply being fourteen-years-old weren't bad enough&#x2015;what with the usual teenage angst and uncertainty, Vicky Austin's always comforting and reliable home life is changing completely.

It would be the largest single act of liberation in the history of American slavery before the Emancipation Proclamation. Despite this courageous move&#x2013;or perhaps because of it&#x2013;Carter&#x2019;s name has all but vanished from the annals of American history. In this haunting, brilliantly original work, Andrew Levy explores the confluence of circumstance, conviction, war, and emotion that led to Carter&#x2019;s extraordinary act.<br><br>As Levy points out, Carter was not the only humane master, nor the sole partisan of emancipation, in that freedom-loving age. So why did he dare to do what other visionary slave owners only dreamed of? In answering this question, Levy reveals the unspoken passions that divided Carter from others of his class, and the religious conversion that enabled him to see his black slaves in a new light. Drawing on years of painstaking research and written with grace and fire, <i>The First Emancipator </i>is an astonishing, challenging, and ultimately inspiring book.<br><br>&#x201c;A vivid narrative of the future emancipator&#x2019;s evolution.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2013;The Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>&#x201c;Highly recommended . . . a truly remarkable story about an eccentric American hero and visionary . . . should be standard reading for anyone with an interest in American history.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>Library Journal </i>(starred review)<br><br>&#x201c;Absorbing. . . Well researched and thoroughly fascinating, this forgotten history will appeal to readers interested in the complexities of American slavery.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013;<i>Booklist </i>(starred review)</p><p>Robert Carter III, the grandson of Tidewater legend Robert "King" Carter, was born into the highest circles of Virginia's Colonial aristocracy. He was neighbor and kin to the Washingtons and Lees and a friend and peer to Thomas Jefferson and George Mason. But on September 5, 1791, Carter severed his ties with this glamorous elite at the stroke of a pen. In a document he called his Deed of Gift, Carter declared his intent to set free nearly five hundred slaves in the largest single act of liberation in the history of American slavery before the Emancipation Proclamation. <br>How did Carter succeed in the very action that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson claimed they fervently desired but were powerless to effect? And why has his name all but vanished from the annals of American history? In this haunting, brilliantly original work, Andrew Levy traces the confluence of circumstance, conviction, war, and passion that led to Carter's extraordinary act. <br>At the dawn of the Revolutionary War, Carter was one of the wealthiest men in America, the owner of tens of thousands of acres of land, factories, ironworks-and hundreds of slaves. But incrementally, almost unconsciously, Carter grew to feel that what he possessed was not truly his. In an era of empty Anglican piety, Carter experienced a feverish religious visionthat impelled him to help build a church where blacks and whites were equals. <br> In an age of publicly sanctioned sadism against blacks, he defied convention and extended new protections and privileges to his slaves. As the war ended and his fortunes declined, Carter dedicated himself even more fiercely to liberty, clashing repeatedly with his neighbors, his friends, government officials, and, most poignantly, his own family. <br>But Carter was not the only humane master, nor the sole partisan of freedom, in that freedom-loving age. Why did this troubled, spiritually torn man dare to do what far more visionary slave owners only dreamed of? In answering this question, Andrew Levy teases out the very texture of Carter's life and soul-the unspoken passions that divided him from others of his class, and the religious conversion that enabled him to see his black slaves in a new light. <br>Drawing on years of painstaking research, written with grace and fire, The First Emancipator is a portrait of an unsung hero who has finally won his place in American history. It is an astonishing, challenging, and ultimately inspiring book. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p>ANDREW LEVY was born in Mount Holly, New Jersey, in 1962.

The French government of Marshal P tain sued for peace and signed an armistice. One little-known junior French general, refusing to accept defeat, made his way to England. On 18 June he spoke to his compatriots over the BBC, urging them to rally to him in London. &#39;Whatever happens, the flame of French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished.&#39; At that moment, Charles de Gaulle entered into history. For the rest of the war, de Gaulle frequently bit the hand that fed him. He insisted on being treated as the true embodiment of France, and quarrelled violently with Churchill and Roosevelt. He was prickly, stubborn, aloof and self-contained. But through sheer force of personality and bloody-mindedness he managed to have France recognised as one of the victorious Allies, occupying its own zone in defeated Germany. For ten years after 1958 he was President of France&#39;s Fifth Republic, which he created and which endures to this day. His pursuit of &#39;a certain idea of France&#39; challenged American hegemony, took France out of NATO and twice vetoed British entry into the European Community. His controversial decolonization of Algeria brought France to the brink of civil war and provoked several assassination attempts. Julian Jackson&#39;s magnificent biography reveals this the life of this titanic figure as never before. It draws on a vast range of published and unpublished memoirs and documents - including the recently opened de Gaulle archives - to show how de Gaulle achieved so much during the War when his resources were so astonishingly few, and how, as President, he put a medium-rank power at the centre of world affairs. No previous biography has depicted his paradoxes so vividly. Much of French politics since his death has been about his legacy, and he remains by far the greatest French leader since Napoleon.</p><p></p><h2>The Blessing Cup (Paula Wiseman Books)</h2><p>&#x201c;The skeins of faith and love that connect a family are all knit together in this powerful, accessible, and deeply affecting story. &#x201c; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review<br> <br> A <i>New York Times</i> bestseller<br> <br>A bond of love unites a family throughout generations in this companion to the beloved and bestselling classic <i>The Keeping Quilt</i>.<br><br>As a young Russian Jewish girl in the early 1900s, Anna and her family lived in fear of the Czar&#x2019;s soldiers.

Kirkus Reviews, starred review Source: Kirkus Reviews<br><br>In this prequel to The Keeping Quilt, readers learn how Polacco&#x2019;s great-grandmother Anna and her parents were forced from their shtetl in Czarist Russia and made their way to America. Among the few treasures the family took with them was a vibrantly painted tea set, a kind of familial talisman (&#x201c;This tea set is magic. Anyone who drinks from it has a blessing from God,&#x201d; says Anna&#x2019;s mother, explaining its lore), which also served as a reminder that they would always be rich in what matters: resilience and love. Only one cup from the tea set made it to their new home, but it played a central role in the family&#x2019;s traditions and milestones through the generations. Polacco opens her heart to readers as few authors can, inviting them to become intimates in her family&#x2019;s low and high points. As in The Keeping Quilt, she renders her unabashedly sentimental scenes of immigrant life in exuberant, fluid gray pencil, reserving the splashes and spots of color primarily for the tea set and&#x2014;in a link to the earlier book&#x2014;the babushka that will become part of the quilt.

Cherry blossoms and swallows might refer to spring; red maple leaves and deer usually imply autumn. These seasonal allusions emphasize the essence of haiku: nature and its ephemeral beauty.</p><p>The graceful, evocative haiku featured here were composed by the renowned Japanese haiku masters of the past four hundred years, including Matsuo Basho, Taniguchi Buson, and Kobayashi Issa. The deceptively simple poems--rendered in English with Japanese calligraphies and transliterations--are paired with exquisite eighteenth- or nineteenth-century paintings and ukiyo-e prints and twentieth-century shin hanga woodcuts from the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, Canada. With their depth and delicacy, wide range of subtle hues, and time-honored focus on landscapes, birds, and flowers, these artworks--like their haiku counterparts--quietly capture a moment in time.</p><p><i>Haiku: Japanese Art and Poetry</i> presents thirty-five pairs of poems and images, organized seasonally.

I spent scores of hours in temples with monks and with instructors of students of Buddhist thought. The discussions I had were always cordial and delightful. Over many a cup of tea, we lingered and talked about life&#x2019;s deepest questions and contrasting answers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Having enjoyed such rapport with those who embrace the Buddhist worldview, I found it difficult to highlight the deep differences between Buddhism and Christianity and not bring offense. Those differences may be discomforting, but they are real. Even the answers the monks gave to my questions were not always the same depending on which school of Buddhism they represented. At times there was frustration on their faces when the questions became tough and their answers dissimilar. But even in the midst of disagreements, they drew comfort from the fact that, for them, agreement was not as important as the pursuit itself.<br>&nbsp;<br>I will always be grateful for their courtesy and hospitality. Although we have radically different answers to life&#x2019;s fundamental questions, we dare not shrink from asking the hard questions just to avoid discomfort.<br>&nbsp;<br>Although a book like this could be slanted any way one pleases, some fundamental ideas are inescapable and must be engaged. In that sense, at least, I trust I have presented the ideas fairly and subjected them to scrutiny. Many of those I talked with will be reading this, and I look forward to their responses. Jesus and Buddha cannot both be right. The lotus is the symbol of Buddhism; the cross, the symbol of the Christian faith. Behind the two symbols stand two diametrically opposed beliefs. I ask you, the reader, to examine the message of each, using both your heart and your mind. It is worth the exercise because it will determine your destiny. One day we will all find out that being respectful and sincere does not give us license to be wrong. Truth demands investigation and commitment. Our conclusions must be in keeping with Truth that can be tested. To be handcuffed by a lie is the worst of all imprisonments. May the God of all truth lead you to the Truth that sets you free indeed.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Prologue</b><br>It is the first blush of dawn as I step into this long-tailed boat after haggling with the boatman for a suitable price. His jolly countenance and leathery skin tell a story all their own. His toothless grin is a cartoonist&#x2019;s dream, and a comb has not visited his sparse scalp for ages. If one has to wake up this early, the sight of him beats the face of a clock any day.<br>&nbsp;<br>He has agreed to take me on a journey along the famed River of Kings. We wend our way through back canals that teem with life, dotted by the corrugated iron rooftops along shores that house a large part of this megacity. A sense of nostalgia surfaces within me as the slumbering multitude begins to stir among the backdrop of temples and pagodas spiraling toward the sky. It is as if the calendar collides here, the past, present, and future all speaking in unison. The morning air is fragrant with aromas ranging from lemongrass to fish sauce, all being prepared for the day&#x2019;s consumption. Yes, the food here wins the palate of virtually every traveler. This is a city I have<br>visited often and its people are among the most winsome in the world. The smiles, the graces, and the charms exude as in no other land I know. A carefree attitude toward life is writ large in the cultural ethos, and strangers make you feel very welcome, even when one may have just cheated you into buying a fake name-brand watch or a pirated copy of the latest movie.<br>&nbsp;<br>I am very much at home on this continent, for it reminds me so much of the land of my birth. But there is a reality here that compels me to ask some hard questions about life. Within this culture, the most reverent of expressions mix with the most unashamed abandon for the sensual. I see a monk walking in the distance, a bowl for begging in his hand, but I also see a man who spends most of his day waylaying tourists and seducing them with pictures to come and visit a nearby brothel. He does that from dawn to dusk, seven days a week. It is quite a juxtaposition: the monk, austere and in pursuit of nirvana; the man, with a roguish smile, promising a different kind of bliss.<br>&nbsp;<br>Here a cultural immersion would be impossible without visiting a host of temples&#x2014;the Emerald Buddha, the Reclining Buddha, the Golden Buddha, and a long list of others. But here, too, the newspapers sound a somber tone. The income from prostitution, they declare, exceeds the entire national budget. Here, drugs and AIDS have ravaged the population, and sincere politicians are trying desperately to deal with it. But this very city is exploited by money-hungry opportunists who bring in planeloads of men, promising them orgies to fulfill every imaginable craving.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>And so as I sit in this sputtering boat, smothered in a misty spray, I feel nearly drowned in a sea of emotions. How does one talk about the eternal when both religion and riotous living argue that nothing is permanent? An odd mix of the glory and the shame of humanity within this microcosm ignites a series of difficult questions.<br>&nbsp;<br>As we make our way down the canal, able to look almost directly into the living quarters of those who live along its shores, I cannot shake the memory of a newspaper article on the front page the previous day. It told the story of a young, attractive woman who left home to earn a living, only to pay the heaviest price of all: the devastation of AIDS. This a summary of that story:<br>&nbsp;<br>At seventeen, young and beautiful Priya decided to head to the big city to work. Within hours of her arrival, the very friend who had enticed her with the promise of big money mercilessly raped her. Thus began a fourteen-year stretch of untold heartache and tragedy. As if to mend Priya&#x2019;s torn spirit, the &#x201c;friend&#x201d; found her a job as a seamstress. But even there Priya found no relief from the plundering ways of those she had cast her lot with. She was soon being used and abused to deviant ends, only with a new twist&#x2014;she was paid for satisfying their perverse pleasures. By the age of twenty-three she had become a full-fledged prostitute, managed by a handful of thugs who<br>shared in the spoils.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fate struck hard one day when she became pregnant. For a few months her profession was put on hold. Inevitably, financial strain set in, and she could hardly wait to give birth to the child so she could give it away, then return to the sordid life that had enslaved her.<br>&nbsp;<br>But a more devastating shock awaited her: She discovered that she was HIV-positive. She could not discontinue her lifestyle, for she needed the money to treat her disease and hang onto life. Hardened, calloused, and almost vengeful, she continued to sell her services to hundreds of customers, including bankers, businessmen, and doctors, of whom she kept a detailed record. She knew she was signing each man&#x2019;s death warrant, but she was drowning in despair, and her life had lost all value. <br>&nbsp;<br>Eventually she could no longer hide the disfiguring marks of her disease. Blisters blanketed her body. She resorted to desperate methods in search of a cure, even boiling a toad and drinking the<br>water, a practice that villagers believed might cure her. She made numerous attempts to kill herself, only to fail each time. Finally Priya poisoned herself once more, and this time she set her house on fire and lay down for the last time, enshrouded in flames.<br>&nbsp;<br>Her once-beautiful body was reduced to ashes. No one would even come close to her charred remains for fear of infection. She died alone. And not far from her others played the same<br>deadly game, thinking that this same end would never be theirs.<br>&nbsp;<br>How can I forget this story? My heart is heavy as I remember it. Are some of the faces I see this morning headed toward the same fearsome future? I am told that hundreds, if not thousands, have made their way to this very city over the years, and that the script has been the same for scores of them.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>What, Lord Jesus, would You have said to Priya, had she brought her decrepit body and aching heart to You? </i>(Actually, many women in similar situations did come to Jesus.)<br>&nbsp;<br>And what would Buddha have said to her, this being a land where 95 percent of its people are Buddhists? Interestingly, the faces of suffering were what led Gautama (the birth name of Buddha) to pursue the answers to such grief, and in that pursuit, he became the Buddha, the &#x201c;Enlightened One.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>A waterfall of questions flows over me, and my mind is caught in a vortex of possibilities. What, I wonder, would Buddha or Jesus say to <i>each other </i>if they were in this boat with me, breathing the pungent smells, witnessing the extreme sights, hearing the lively sounds, and discussing the plight of this young woman? Many Buddhist scholars have drawn parallels between Buddha&#x2019;s and Jesus&#x2019; teachings; one noted scholar even called them &#x201c;brothers.&#x201d; Is that an accurate portrayal? Or did this scholar, among others, completely miss the fundamental differences? <br>&nbsp;<br>I let my imagination take a ride and picture just such a conversation.</p><h2>How We Win: A Guide to Nonviolent Direct Action Campaigning</h2><p><b>A lifetime of activist experience informs this playbook for building and conducting nonviolent direct action campaigns</b><br><br>Beginning as a trainer in the civil rights movement of the 1960s,&nbsp;George Lakey has been on the front lines of social change for&nbsp;decades.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, in this timely and down-to-earth guide, he passes the torch to&nbsp;a new generation of activists hitting the streets. He looks to successful&nbsp;campaigns across the world to help us see what has worked and what&nbsp;hasn&#x2019;t: from choosing the right target, to designing a creative campaign;&nbsp;from avoiding burnout within your group, to building a movement of movements&nbsp;to achieve real progressive victories.&nbsp;<br><br>Drawing on the experiences of a diverse set of ambitious change-makers, <i>How We Win</i> shows us the way to justice, peace, and a sustainable&nbsp;economy. This is what democracy looks like.</p><p><b>GEORGE LAKEY</b> has been active in direct action campaigns&nbsp;for six decades. Recently retired from Swarthmore College, where he was&nbsp;the Eugene M. Lang Visiting Professor for Issues of Social Change, Lakey&nbsp;was first arrested at a civil rights demonstration in March 1963, and his&nbsp;most recent arrest was March 29, 2018, as a participant in the Power&nbsp;Local Green Jobs Campaign. He lives in Philadelphia.How We Win INTRODUCTION WHY THIS BOOK NOW?<p>Nonviolent direct action is a set of tactics that go outside conventional means of advocacy, like running for office, going to the courts, doing media campaigns, and the like. Community organizers sometimes call nonviolent direct action &#x201c;street heat&#x201d;&#x2014;blocking entrances, boycotting, fasting, tree-sitting, planting gardens where a pipeline is supposed to go, and hundreds of other kinds of actions.</p><p>Today, teenagers for gun control, women for equality, African Americans for safety from unaccountable police, indigenous people for respect for their land and traditions, teachers and other workers for a living wage, grandparents for climate justice, and more&#x2014;millions of people&#x2014;are going beyond lobbying to insist on change.</p><p>Direct action flourished in the 1960s. Martin Oppenheimer and I were then graduate sociology students active in the civil rights movement, and Marty went on to a distinguished career as a teacher and writer led by concerns for justice. In 1963, he and I noticed that some activists were learning very rapidly from others&#x2019; experience. Others were not, sometimes making mistakes that were dangerous and even fatal.</p><p>With movements expanding rapidly, organizers were too busy to download their wisdom into a manual. Some groups were failing to achieve their goals not because they lacked numbers and heart but because they made needless mistakes.</p><p>To assist more people to get in on the movement learning curve, Oppenheimer and I wrote <i>A Manual for Direct Action, </i>just in time for the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer.1 Veteran civil rights strategist Bayard Rustin wrote the foreword. A black organizer in the South told me with a smile it was like a &#x201c;first-aid handbook&#x2014;what to do until Dr. King comes.&#x201d; The book was picked up by other 1960s movements, too.</p><p>In the past two years I&#x2019;ve traveled to over 100 cities and towns in the United States, England, and Scotland with my latest book, <i>Viking Economics.</i>2 I was asked repeatedly for a new direct action book that addressed today&#x2019;s situation. On both sides of the Atlantic most people are losing ground. That&#x2019;s also happening literally, in coastal areas where the seas are rising. Governmental legitimacy is declining and trust is evaporating.</p><p>It&#x2019;s a good time to take a fresh look at what has worked in times of trouble, and share what I and my fellow activists have learned about successful campaigning that gives hope for the future.</p><p>And so, what follows is a different guide from the one Marty and I wrote over 50 years ago. Then, movements operated inside a robust U.S. Empire that was used to winning its wars and a Britain that, however hesitatingly, was moving toward social democracy.</p><p>Now, the U.S. Empire is faltering, the economy is fragile, and even some populations&#x2019; average life expectancy is declining. On the other side of the Atlantic, a dis&#x2013;United Kingdom struggles with major questions of where to go from here. Wealth inequality skyrockets on both sides of the pond, and major political parties are caught in their own versions of society-wide polarization.</p><p>The goal of the book is to offer movement-building approaches that win major changes rather than small reforms. At the same time, campaigns need to involve the many participants who hope that sufficient change can come through a series of limited reforms.</p><p>In building those movements, it helps to avoid competition between direct action campaigners and those who address problems in other ways, like doing direct service and building alternatives or being policy advocates. This book helps direct action campaigners establish productive relationships with those whose contributions to the movement utilize different skill sets.</p><p>I believe that building successful movements now requires fancier dancing than back in the day. This book suggests ways to accelerate movements&#x2019; learning&#x2014;from their own experience and from each other. Because a movement&#x2019;s learning curve depends on how healthy its organizational forms and processes are, this book is not only about strategy and tactics, but also about what goes on inside the groups that wage the struggle.</p><p>One thing is easier now: creating instant mass protests. Social media&#x2019;s ability to increase our power to mobilize is so dramatic that it can cause us to forget that <i>mobilizing</i> is not the same as <i>organizing.</i> Also, that one-off protests, however large, are nowhere near as powerful as sustained campaigns.</p><p>This book also offers a process that supports you, with others, in setting goals that are meaningful for your group. Successful goal-setting takes into account the cultural moment and how the goal fits into the group&#x2019;s larger vision.</p><p>It is possible to wage campaigns that move you closer to bringing about the transformational change you want. This book gives you examples, explains their innovations, and leads you to other resources that will help you start and conduct successful campaigns.</p><p>One major resource that contributes to the spirit and information in this book is the Global Nonviolent Action Database (GNAD). While teaching at Swarthmore College between 2006 and 2014, I worked with students to launch a new, searchable source of knowledge about campaigns: the GNAD. So far, the database has published over 1,100 campaigns addressing racism, sexism, and other systematic oppressions, environmental crises, violence, dictatorship and authoritarian abuses, and more. Each case includes the unfolding narrative of the opponent&#x2019;s response, what happened if violence broke out, and how various allies acted in support of the campaigns.</p><p>Campaigns in the GNAD were waged by workers, students, farmers, women, middle-class professionals, and other groups. The campaigns are given scores on degree of success, so it&#x2019;s possible to note what the more successful campaigns did as compared to less successful campaigns.3 Since we placed the GNAD on the Internet it has been visited by people from almost 200 countries.</p>A DIVERSITY LENS<p>This is a how-to book for people who want a diversity lens. In multiple chapters the reader will find ways of thinking and working that take into account human and cultural differences, including how injustice distorts our working together.</p><p>A successful social movement includes many different styles and preferences, because to make big change the movement needs to grow and be sustainable. This book supports inclusivity and open acknowledgment of difference.</p><p>Take strategizing, for example. Strategizing is the job of developing an overall plan and calling the &#x201c;moves&#x201d; as the campaign encounters opportunities&#x2014;and challenges from the opponent. Different traditions assign this task to a trusted individual, a small group, or a much larger group that gives a wide representation of the entire campaign.</p><p>The 2016 North Dakota pipeline campaign&#x2019;s decisions were made by the host group&#x2014;the Sioux people who lived there. Others who gathered to participate were expected to carry out those decisions. Other campaigns seek to share decision-making with everyone. Occupy Wall Street expected to make strategic decisions through open assemblies with the cooperation of most participants.</p><p>In this guide we allow for such differences by offering a set of strategy tools that have proved useful, no matter who makes strategic decisions and how they make them.</p><p>In the writing I&#x2019;m forthright about my own politics, but the value of the book doesn&#x2019;t depend on your agreement with where I stand on various issues. It&#x2019;s okay to take what&#x2019;s useful and forget the rest.</p>MY POLITICAL INFLUENCES<p>My own politics were shaped by the civil rights movement&#x2014;it was where I was first arrested, after all. I&#x2019;m also struck by how often the brilliance shown in that movement has relevance for us now.</p><p>I went on to give leadership in the movement against the Vietnam war, at one point finding myself on a peace mission on a small sailing ship surrounded by hostile gunboats just off the Vietnamese coast. In the early 1970s I came out as a gay man and plunged into the LGBTQ movement while also co-founding Movement for a New Society, a network of autonomous collectives that gave training and strategy support to a variety of campaigns in that decade, including the successful struggle against nuclear power. As an ally to women and children, I co-founded Men Against Patriarchy, then drew on my working-class origins to help form a cross-class, cross-race coalition to fight President Reagan&#x2019;s initiatives that stoked inequality in this country.</p><p>This book benefits from my learning from other movement activists in over 20 countries while facilitating workshops with Training for Change (TfC). Since I returned to academia in 2006 I saw TfC expand its facilitator team with more people of color and increase its outreach, continuing to act as a pollinator of good ideas while challenging participants to make learning breakthroughs.</p><p>Another source is the reporting from movement work in multiple countries coming from <i>Waging Nonviolence.</i> My writing the &#x201c;Living Revolution&#x201d; column for that publication and encountering responses by thoughtful readers has sharpened many of the ideas in this book.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll often refer to lessons from today&#x2019;s experience of the campaigning group I co-founded in 2009: Earth Quaker Action Team, or EQAT. It&#x2019;s where I get to practice spirit-in-action. The EQAT campaigners deliberately seek to incorporate many best practices from other campaigns and also try creative experiments to meet challenges that movements face now.</p><p>The Nordic countries are the global high achievers for the goals of progressive activists in the United States and United Kingdom, but a century ago they were mired in poverty and oppression. How they made their turnaround inspires me. In the 1920s and &#x2018;30s the trajectory of the Nordics&#x2019; movements ran parallel to those of the United States and the United Kingdom, then they were able to break through to a new level. It turned out that they had advantages that enabled them to gain breakthroughs that the rest of us couldn&#x2019;t achieve at the time.</p><p>We can learn from the Nordics&#x2019; strategies; they took on the challenge of their divisions and the threat of their growing Nazi movements in highly creative ways. Their turnaround strategies were the focus of <i>Viking Economics.</i> Like all movements, they made their share of mistakes. They also got some things right, and those have influenced me in writing this book.</p>CONTRIBUTORS TO THE BOOK<p>Movements benefit from fresh perceptions and creative initiatives. These ideas come from activists of all ages, but are especially likely to come from the young and from people with identities different from &#x201c;the usual suspects.&#x201d; And younger people deserve to find in movements a friendly place to grow to face tough challenges.</p><p>To walk the talk in this book, I&#x2019;ve invited three activists from different generations and identities from me to contribute. They all have practical advice seasoned by in-depth experience. Daniel Hunter is an African American man who, at 37, has been campaigning for over 20 years and now mentors and trains climate change campaigners around the globe. Ryan Leitner started environmental justice campaigning during college and is now the field organizer for EQAT. Eileen Flanagan is a Quaker author from a working-class Irish background, a mother of two college students, and a teacher of online courses about nonviolent direct action.</p><p>One of the things we share is a view of campaigning as more than a technology. We present ways of working that don&#x2019;t burn people out, ways that support campaigners to be the best human beings they can be.</p><p>Whether a particular campaign wins or loses, the people waging the campaign can win in their own sense of power and take their lessons forward to win the next time. Campaigns, because they take place over time, provide a container for healing and growth.</p><p>The truth is, no one deserves a society that systematically violates them or treats them unjustly. Campaigns can be designed to help people gain some experience of their own deservingness.</p><p>The occasional protest gives an individual the experience of taking a stand. A sustained campaign adds support and increased chance of effectiveness. By staying connected and acting together over time, each person can experience both the win for social justice and an expansion of their humanity.</p><p>Welcome to this guide.</p></p><h2>West of Jesus: Surfing, Science, and the Origins of Belief</h2><p><p>After spending two years in bed with Lyme disease, Steven Kotler had lost everything: his health, his job, his girl, and, he was beginning to suspect, his mind. Kotler, not a religious man, suddenly found himself drawn to the sport of surfing as if it were the cornerstone of a new faith. Why, he wondered, when there was nothing left to believe in, could he begin to believe in something as unlikely as surfing? What was belief anyway? How did it work in the body, the brain, our culture, and human history? With the help of everyone from rebel surfers to rocket scientists, Kotler undertakes a three-year globetrotting quest. The results are a startling mix of big waves and bigger ideas: a surfer's journey into the biological underpinnings of belief itself. <br>Steven Kotler's novel <i>The Angle Quickest for Flight </i>was a <i>San Francisco Chronicle </i>bestseller and won the William L. Crawford IAFA Fantasy Award. His nonfiction has appeared in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>GQ</i>, <i>Discover</i>, <i>Outside</i>, <i>Details</i>, <i>Wired</i>, <i>Men's Journal</i>, and elsewhere. He lives in Los Angeles. <br>Praise for <i>West of Jesus</i>: <br>"West of Jesus is one of the smartest books ever about the sport and religion of surfing."-<i>Los Angeles Magazine</i> <br>"The ideal book for any readers who have ever asked themselves, 'How did surfing take over my life?' Kotler brings us closer to the answers via a wild, globe-trotting journey in search of surfing's much-referenced but rarely discussed spiritual side."-<i>Los Angeles Times</i> <br>"A surprisingly entertaining nonfiction account of his own spiritual quest through surfing... Kotler is often laugh-out-loud funny."-<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> <br>"Kotler's tale starts slow and then, like a seasoned surfer calibrating his board to his ride, monumentally catches stride...Call it mysterioso or the oceanic feeling, what Kotler's seeking is nothing less than the big explanation."-<i>Village Voice</i></p></p><p><p><b>Steven Kotler</b>'s novel <i>The Angle Quickest for Flight</i> was a <i>San </i><i>Fran</i><i>cisco Chronicle</i> bestseller and won the William L. Crawford IAFA Fantasy Award. His nonfiction has appeared in the <i>New York Times Magazine, GQ, National Geographic, Details, Wired, Men's Journal, Maxim, Salon,</i> and elsewhere. He has surfed all over the world and lives in Los Angeles, California.</p>After surviving a battle with Lyme disease, Kotler finds himself searching for a reason to live and turns to his love of surfing. The novelist (<i>The Angle Quickest for Flight</i>) and journalist travels to Mexico, where he hears a story about a magical being called "the Conductor," who controls the surf. Having heard the same tale eight years earlier while surfing in Indonesia, Kotler decides to seek out the legend's source while researching the inherent mysticism of surfers and their sport. Detailing his journey and findings, Kotler creates a work that combines the most compelling elements of memoir, travelogue and scholarly abstract into an accessible tale of physical and mental adventure. Up for anything, Kotler seeks out big waves, bungee jumping and a risky helicopter ride. He also delves into far-flung topics: surfing's history, Joseph Campbell's work on myths, Jungian psychology, Zen Buddhism, government "weather modification" experiments and the religious beliefs of islanders like the Maori and Hawaiians. The book reaches its peak when Kotler focuses on the inner workings of the human brain. His reasoning of how genetic and biological factors combine with physical and emotional experiences to create the spiritual "funkytown" feeling unique to surfing is both enlightening and inspirational. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This extraordinary book explains these&nbsp;relationships with examples of&nbsp;astronomical data comparing the frequencies of planatery orbits, in architectural works, in ancient and modern measuring systems,&nbsp;the human body, music and medicine.&nbsp;Cousto reveals how music is truly the language of the cosmos and of the natural&nbsp;world.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p>
